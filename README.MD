### Group Members
* Alex Smith
* Andrew Altman
* Joe Geoghegan

### Proposal
Our goal is to predict future returns.
To do this we are using current/historic stock data as well as sentiment data from several sources.
The sources we are analyzing are Twitter, news sources, as well as written statements in quarterly reports.
We plan to run our model on multiple companies in several sectors.
