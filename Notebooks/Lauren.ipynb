Read more at straitstimes.com.\",\"body\":\"Copy to clipboard\\nhttps://str.sg/w68t\\nSYDNEY  Australia's antitrust regulator has filed a lawsuit against Airbnb, accusing the accommodation-sharing website of misleading users into paying more than advertised for their stays, widening its scrutiny of global technology platforms.\\nFrom 2018 to last year, the San Francisco-based Internet giant advertised and charged room rates in US dollars without indicating the much higher figures in Australian currency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a court filing yesterday.\\nAirbnb refused to refund users who complained about being misled, saying they had chosen to view rates in the greenback even though users said they had not, the ACCC said in the filing, adding that the firm also refused to refund currency conversion fees, claiming they were banks' responsibility.\\nThe Australian dollar bought an average of 72 US cents during the time covered by the lawsuit, meaning a customer renting accommodation advertised at US$500 would actually pay around A$700 plus foreign exchange fees, the regulator said.\\n\\\"While a fraction of a percentage of guests are believed to have been impacted... we will compensate affected guests,\\\" Ms Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand, said by e-mail but declined to offer further details.\\nMs Wheeldon said Airbnb has since updated its platform, so relevant currencies are \\\"clearly displayed\\\" from the first page for Australian guests.\\nIn the lawsuit, the ACCC said Airbnb stood to benefit unfairly over competitors because the \\\"false and misleadingly low prices conveyed... made the accommodation available on the platform appear to be more attractive\\\".\\nThe regulator told Reuters in an e-mailed response that, while the court would determine any amount of penalty, the maximum fine per breach would be the number greater of A$10 million (S$9.9 million), thrice the value of the benefit obtained, or 10 per cent of the annual turnover made over the past year.\\n\\\"However, we note this is only the maximum penalty per breach, and the ACCC may seek a higher amount if there are multiple breaches,\\\" it added.\\nThe lawsuit puts Airbnb in the company of several high-profile targets of a regulator bent on reining in the power of big technology firms, including Meta Platforms' Facebook and Alphabet's Google regarding content licensing fees. It is currently conducting a review of Amazon.com and other online retailers that may recommend changes to the sector.\\nREUTERS\",\"snippet\":\"...

Lets just call it distribution for right now. It was a big partnership. It was a very in-depth partnership. The lawyers were papering it. Wed gotten up to all the business points. Three weeks before it was going to be announced, Marriott decided they had cold feet. That was probably 2015, at that point.\\nDid it include a Marriott investment in Airbnb, Marriott offering properties on Airbnb, or Airbnb listing properties on Marriott? Conley didnt say, and both Airbnb and Marriott declined to comment.\\nBut I say that to say, ultimately, Marriott moved in the direction of creating their own Homes & Villas product, which is higher end, Conley said. Its understandable.\\nAirbnb Saw Professional Hosts Gaining Market Share and Mulled Buying Sonder\\nFormer Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Laurence Tosi said in the oral history that it was around 2015 or 2016 when Airbnb saw that property managers were taking market share from individual hosts, the soul of the company, on the platform.  And we made a presentation to the board of Airbnb saying, The rise of professional listings is real,' Tosi said.\\nTensions with individual hosts colored a potential deal to acquire Sonder.\\nAnd then we looked at, at one point, buying Sonder in the early days and ultimately decided that it was a different business model, Tosi said.  And we didnt want the conflict of our individual hosts seeing us buy a professional host because theres a little bit of tension there, a little bit cultural tension to a certain extent. So we ended up not doing it.\\nBoth Airbnb and Sonder declined to comment on any potential transaction several years ago.\\nAirbnb Buys Luxury Retreats and HomeAway Made an Offer Too\\nIn 2017, Airbnb acquired Luxury Retreats for $224.1 million in cash and stock.\\nLuxury Retreats would curate the homes and all the homes had management within them, Tosi said in the oral history. It was a very high-end excellent experience. And so we bought that because one, Joe Poulin, the founder, was an incredible entrepreneur and we thought he would add a lot to the management team. Two, we thought they had a really great business model and a great offering. And it clearly had loyalty. It helped us upscale Airbnb into a more serviced home-type environment.\\nTosi said he knew there was another offer to buy Luxury Retreats, but didnt know who it was from. And actually, HomeAway [which was part of Expedia Group] bid on them as well, Tosi said in the oral history. We didnt know that at the time. But we were both interested in buying them. We both made offers. I knew there was another bid, I didnt know who it was. And we both made offers and ultimately Joe sold to us and now thats still a big part of Airbnb.\\nIn Brief\\nAustralia Takes Legal Action Against Airbnb\\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission filed a legal case against Airbnb, alleging that the short-term rental platform misled guests from 2018 to 2021 by displaying prices up until the last step before booking in U.S. dollars rather than Australian dollars. That meant that consumers were actually paying considerably more for their stays when the booking was converted into Australian dollars.\\nThe Guardian\\nEdreams Odigeo Now Has 3 Million Subscribers\\nAfter announcing in late May that its Prime subscription service had reached 2.9 million subscribers who get discounts and promotions for flights, hotels and cars by March 31, Edreams Odigeo announced Wednesday that it breached the 3 million mark.

One song was even from back before the Beatles were \\\"the Beatles\\\", as Paul performed \\\"In Spite of All the Danger\\\", which was written while Paul was part of The Quarrymen. In addition to playing with the band, Paul also performed a handful of solo pieces, such as \\\"Blackbird\\\" and \\\"Yesterday\\\" (as part of the lengthy encore).\\nI wasn't expecting to hear anything written by George Harrison or John Lennon, but Paul did play a ukele rendition of Harrison's \\\"Something\\\" as a tribute to his departed friend.

We're hooked.\",\"body\":\"Dot Recs\\nPosted on Jun 8, 2022\\nAirbnb isnt dead, but its certainly lost its luster as the go-to option for a quick relaxing getaway over the years. Fees are through the roof and a glut of investment properties means youre often paying a premium for a boring drab space. Why spend hundreds to visit someone elses house? If youre truly looking to escape from your daily life, you might just need a Getaway.\\nReady to find out more? Keep reading for our Getaway review.\\nWhat is Getaway?\\nGetaway is a change of pace from the traditional Airbnb or hotel vacation escape. Rather than a place to sleep on vacation, Getaway is the vacation, offering feature-packed tiny home cabins in the woods. Its every comfort of home you could imagine, with none of the distractions of modern life.\\nFound in 2015 by two Harvard students, Getaway was designed as the ultimate vacation from modern life. You get the comforts of home without the connections that pull you out of the moment.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nTell me about Getaways cabins\\nEach cabin comes with heat and AC, power outlets, a kitchen to cook, a stunningly comfortable bed, and a giant picture window to enjoy the views of nature. Most importantly for soft city folk, theres a bathroom complete with a hot shower.\\nWhat you dont get is just as much a feature. Theres no TV and no wi-fi. Each cabin comes with a little box to put your phone in so you wont be distracted during your stay. Everything that makes the great outdoors great, without forcing you to endure well the great outdoors.\\nWhere can I rent a Getaway house?\\nCurrently Getaway has over 19 locations around the United States, providing a perfect glamping experience from California to Tennessee and everywhere in between.\\nYou can find them in Atlanta, Austin, San Antonio, Boston, Charlotte + Raleigh, Chicago, DC, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Machimoodus, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Eastern Catskills, Western Catskills, Pittsburgh-Cleveland, Portland, and Seattle.\\nWith such beautifully designed cabins and the promise of a peaceful nights sleep we simply had to see for ourselves if it was too good to be true. Thankfully the fine folks at Getaway were kind enough to let us review a cabin for the evening at the companys Nashville location.\\nGetaway review: Our night with Getaway house\\nPart 1: Arrival\\nUpon arriving its immediately clear how far away your campground is from society. We stayed at the Nashville location, but the cabin was actually about an hour away in Celina, TN. This gave us the gift of being far away from Bachelorette parties or loud parties.\\nOur campground was at the back of an acres deep property, past dozens of other tiny cabins, spaced far enough apart to provide a private experience. When we pulled up we were greeted with a beautiful cabin, fire pit and chairs, picnic table, and box of fire supplies. We also discovered two bars of cell signal and 5G that only occasionally decided to work. Even without wi-fi, the remote location kept us disconnected.\\nWhat immediately struck me, even before walking inside the cabin, is the stillness. Nature has a soft and beautiful white noise thats often hard to hear in the city. Theres simply too much ambient sound, and the hum of nature gets drowned out. As you stand in the stillness and breath the clean mountain hair, a sense of peace washes over you. If not checking your email was a physical sensation, it would be this feeling.\\nPart 2: Your home away from  Stepping into your cabin is a little surreal if youve never been in a nice tiny house before. The beech-colored wood paneling creates a warm ambiance for your evening apartment. One side of the cabin is made up of a tiny little kitchen. Youll discover everything you could need: a counter, sink, burner, fridge, and cooking supplies. In the cabinets, youll find basiccoffee, tea, smores suppliesthat can be purchased for a small fee.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nOn the far end of the cabin in your bed, a gloriously soft queen-size mattress is next to a giant picture window. For science, we immediately curled up with a book and enjoyed the early evening golden hour pouring through the window. Dont worry about privacy or needing a dark room to sleep in. Theres a blind you can pull down.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nAt the other end of the cabin in the bathroom. The worst part of camping is always the bathroom. Youre either stuck using an outhouse or public restroom best. At worst youre doing your business in the woods. Like a common bear. Getaway gives you your own private bathroom, complete with soft toilet paper, unlike the single-ply horrors of public campgrounds.\\nAcross from the toilet is a frankly incredible shower. Its wild to imagine this kind of shower pressure in a tiny house in the woods. Sure, youll run out of hot water faster than at home, but its a lovely luxury.\\nPart 3: Oh crapwe forgot supplies, and Getaway saved the day\\nUpon arrival, we realized we forgot to bring food. This is important to consider when plotting your trip. Getaways little kitchen is perfect for cooking a small dinner and the firepit can easily handle steaks if you bring them. While we found a wonderful meal in town (shout out to Dale Hollow 1 Stop BBQ), Getaway offers a food box with pasta, oatmeal, soup, and other goodies for $30.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nOnce settled in for the night we decided to build a campfire to enjoy some smores and the cool mountain air. Each campsite is equipped with a box containing everything you would need to make a fire, each for a small cost. This is somewhere Getaway would easily gouge campers, but the prices are incredibly reasonable.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nA bundle of firewood was $8 and lasted us four three hours of campfire time. If you havent built a fire since scouts as a kid like myself, you can also get a simple firestarter for $2. Finally, the smores set up was $5. Frankly, this is a steal if youve ever tried to make smores for two people. Smores are three separate purchases at a minimum, and your $5 includes two sticks for roasting.\\nA quick note about smores\\nIf you want the best smore experience after you make your cookie, place it on the included grill top. Roast your smores when given the opportunity.Youre welcome.\\nJohn-Michael Bond\\nPart 4: Goodnight Getaway\\nAfter a relaxing evening of sugar and several beers, we finally called it an evening. Making sure to fully smother our fire, we retired for the night to our plush bed. We were blessed to schedule our visit during a full moon. The picture window and bed made for the most comfortable star gazing Ive ever experienced the moon rose in the night sky.\\nYour campground is far from the city, providing you with a crystal clear view of the cosmos along with the gentle rustling of nature echoing through the woods. The moon illuminated the forest around us as we dozed off. Hours later we were woken by the warmth of the morning sun. Check-out was at 11 AM, the same as any other overnight lodging.\\nWhat makes Getaway dif\",\"snippet\":\"<b>Airbnb</b> isnt dead, but its certainly lost its luster as the go-to option for a quick relaxing getaway over the years.
