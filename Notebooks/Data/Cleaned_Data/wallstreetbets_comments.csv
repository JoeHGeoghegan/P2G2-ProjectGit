2013-01-08 11:58:32,"This seems to only be for currencies, anything similar for stocks ?."

2013-01-07 19:26:28,"Wtf, this is where all the random followers are coming from."
2013-01-07 12:25:00,I just bought into PODD moments ago at 22.50.  Looks like it is headed for a breakout.  It broke the upper limit of its triangle today on high volume.
2013-01-07 02:16:28,Investopedia is a great one. Spend some time with it before trading real money. 
2013-01-04 09:05:06,"I did well off that last FSLR breakout, this looks promising too."
2013-01-01 05:29:58,"Yeah, we wouldn't be looking for a huge jump. This isn't biopharma, we would be looking for a 10-30% increase over a few weeks, if the charts are reliable at all. But a sire-fire 30% is worth quite a bit, and that's the point of my inquiry. So far, I haven't found good evidence to support such a conclusion. "
2013-01-01 02:02:19,"Aren't most gun manufacturers supply constrained, and the demand is generally temporary and unpredictable which would generally keep the prices from skyrocketing too much?  I don't follow gun stocks, but I am friends with a gun enthusiast and that's the general idea I got from discussing things with him."
2012-12-31 18:33:31,"Sure, the FDA wrote in the CRL that the issue was solely with the third party manufacturer NAVB contracted. It's why NAVB got another approval date in 6 months, not a matter of years. The FDA had no stated issues with efficacy, and no issues with safety. The data shows comfortable efficacy(by FDA standards) and a process shown to be safer than the current standard: PET-scan. 

There is no real basis for rejection, and the product is entering an uncontested market. If there were any issues from the first approval date, NAVB had the money to address the concerns, they have not taken any of that money available. There is always a risk of rejection, but here it seems to be negligible, at least from where I'm sitting. 

I don't know anything about ONCS, so I can't say if there was equal reason to believe approval was so certain. "
2012-12-31 18:28:31,Could you provide insight as to how it seems to be a sure fire approval? I noticed someone saying the same thing about ONCS. You shouldn't use such definite terms..
2012-12-31 18:26:09,"To a certain degree, yes. But I'm willing to wade through mediocre performance and losses to get those sweet gains. There is value here, and I'm buying for that reason. I sold at a nice price to avoid some losses, but the value is there. "
2012-12-31 18:16:00,"Someone's trying to time the market!
"
2012-12-31 14:16:25,truth
2012-12-31 14:15:49,because I don't think it is wise to try to time the market.
2012-12-31 14:12:14,So why not look for the bump and plan a time to short?
2012-12-31 14:04:40,"Yep, I plan it. . .actually I'll be buying some guns when they drop in price. :)"
2012-12-31 13:58:36,"And after the bump, run like hell, because those years of sale are coming to abrupt and long dry-spell. "
2012-12-31 11:38:44,Many stores have observed 3.5 years of sales in just a few weeks.  I think it would be a good short term play.
2012-12-31 11:29:17,why dont u take a look at tvix
2012-12-31 11:29:07,looks like all of you were fucking wrong
2012-12-31 11:24:16,"I thought the same before their earnings in december

got my face ripped off - might be a different play for march earnings due to no tax selling before jan 1 and the sales rationale like you just stated"
2012-12-29 17:01:13,"Not necessarily.  You just have to find something that will benefit from uncertainty, or you have to bet whichever way you think it will be resolved."
2012-12-29 11:34:37,So is it best to just sit on the sidelines and not trade until this fiscal cliff issue is resolved? 
2012-12-29 01:44:54,"npurcell8 said it, but I'll reiterate that he's pretty much right.  The bulls are holding, and the bears are selling ahead of the cliff... not much of a risk on period for traders right now until they see what comes out of the cliff talks."
2012-12-29 01:26:44,That works too.
2012-12-29 01:19:03,Fiscal cliff fears. Overreactions IMO but obviously I don't exactly matter in the market haha.
2012-12-28 22:20:50,Thanks for that. I picked up a few thousand worth of TZA.
2012-12-28 22:19:25,"In addition, database vendor Oracle has priced their licensing in such a way as to kill Oracle on HP hardware. We are working toward stopping sending Oracle huge (!) chunks of cash and when we do, the HP hardware may go too."
2012-12-28 20:07:36,Or you can trade futures. 
2012-12-28 20:07:23,Im still short some :) 
2012-12-28 20:05:43,You were lucky. 
2012-12-28 08:52:06,fo super serious
2012-12-28 00:37:58,srsly...
2012-12-27 22:20:16,"I prefer to roll the dice.  My stocks do better after I get out of them, so I figure if I'm random in buying, I have a better chance.  For instance, I had to cover RIMM going up through the 11s.  "
2012-12-27 22:11:12,I'm wrong quite often as well.  The good news is that only one of us will be wrong this time :)
2012-12-27 22:06:56,"i dont know why you were down voted
i agree, the USD will be devalued"
2012-12-27 21:40:01,just make sure you are buying on good fundamentals instead of buying for buying sake tho
2012-12-27 19:48:56,Nope.  I do what Warren Buffet says.  Buy a bunch of crap when everyone is selling it and stand there holding the bag.
2012-12-27 19:39:55,"I've lightened up. But I'm not so sure the market is heading down hard. The fiscal cliff is over exaggerated by the media. Payroll tax goes back up but everything else takes time to really kick in. 
I'm a permabear but the market never seems to go where I think it should. So why fight it"
2012-12-27 19:24:37,"My gut tells me that tomorrow will be down again, but if it isn't then Monday will be (after the Sunday meeting goes badly).

Of course, I am wrong a lot :P"
2012-12-27 19:19:29,"I'm betting that the down day we saw today was the down day you are waiting for.  I picked up some more FB calls (based on how effective Twitter's promoted tweets are, I think FB's sponsored posts will beat expectations), 200 QCOM shares and I'm still in my 20 shares of AAPL, average price of 512."

2012-12-27 16:52:36,[deleted]
2012-12-27 03:08:00,Correct. And adding your name to that list makes the lawsuit a tiny bit more likely to win. 
2012-12-26 20:30:24,"For stuff like this, I usually look for a movement at the next open. For today, I was either lucky or right. "
2012-12-26 17:23:55,No idea what you're talking about. Are you suggesting that a service interruption is enough to make some stock tank? 
2012-12-26 10:50:41,"Is there a downside to adding your name to the suit?  The way I see it is that I'll get a check if they win, and if they lose then it's no sweat off my back."
2012-12-25 13:27:35,"Of course they pop-up all the time, who wouldn't want to go after companies big enough to get a large settlement out of, but too small ti hire an army of lawyers. This a great size company for that. Zynga, alternatively is probably too big for all but the behemoth law-firms to expect any shot past filing the complaint. 

Publicly traded companies owe their investors a duty to take reasonable care in handling the business and money. This is their fiduciary responsibility, and if they've failed to keep that duty, or have violated their fiduciary responsibilities in some way, then the lawsuit has merit and meets the prima facie case. However, one good reason why lawsuits like these never go anywhere is because the standards for proving mismanagement are very high, with lots of exceptions.

Where's the line between fraud/tortious mismanagement and legitimate business decision? How does one go about demonstrating that the company should know better? These are difficult elements to prove in many cases like this. However, this time it seems a bit easier. They claimed they had all this new data, they claimed they had efficacy of some significance, and it was an outright lie. All they did was apply new statistical analysis to old studies, and they found no new efficacy, not through any rigorous process. 

In short, most of these cases are expected to fail, but this one has a pretty good head-start given the recent developments and very public facts. "
2012-12-25 13:19:33,"Stupid was the wrong phrasing. It wasn't worth my time as someone who prop bet it. It isn't necessarily without merit, but suits like these pop up all the time after prices plummet (not sure if it's common in pharma though, lemme know) and never go anywhere. It's not necessarily frivolous, I just doubt anyone sees a real way to save their investment in it."
2012-12-25 13:14:00,"They mismanaged the company ... that's the lawsuit. Why do you think this suit is without merit? Furthermore, the largest slam against them wasn't the adcom, the adcom wasn't all that bad and it was by a bunch of idiots. Their problem was the statistician who ripped their a-hole wide open. "
2012-12-25 13:09:34,"Oh I'm so in. I owned HEB and sold it two weeks ago for Christmas money and was gonna reinvest right before the approval, but didn't and got lucky hahaha"
2012-12-25 12:55:25,GET IN THE GAME!
2012-12-25 10:24:51,"Binary options give you a chance to ""bet"" on the direction of stocks. It's a form of gambling, but on something tangible, that can be followed in a newspaper, your computer, or phone.

The ""binary option"" means you have two options: ""Up (Call)"" or ""Down (Put).""

You are literally betting on whether the stock, index, asset, currency, etc. will go up or down. If it goes down and you predicted that it would go down, you win!

You don't need to follow the stock constantly; you simply indicate the timeout (i.e. 60 seconds, 6 months, whatever you want), and you will be notified if you won.

As for verification issues, that is for the sanctity of the consumer as well as the provider. It's a high risk market and there's a **LOT** of fraud going on - this prevents that fraud.

Good luck!"
2012-12-25 07:52:24,"God, pharma is fucking crazy."
2012-12-25 07:44:39,"Welp, I made my quick cash off it. Bought at July 1, sold mid-December. Got lucky I needed to get liquid (aka cash for Christmas presents). This suit is stupid though, they've mismanaged the drug hugely but at the same time they got fucked by the swap up in the review committee. Whatcha gonna do."
2012-12-25 04:26:09,HEB is impossible to short right now for anything shy of 50k + fees. 
2012-12-24 20:56:47,I've seen tons of these lawsuits whenever a stock takes a plunge.  They don't go anywhere nor do they affect stock price.

2012-12-23 18:21:54,"The more bio I play, the more I see how fucking nuts it is. However, from the losses I become stronger. The short-term trader like Sheff is really the best way to play with this sector, but you need to have a good understanding of how bio moves leading to and after catalysts, and that is unique to each company."
2012-12-21 13:18:20,"If you made money, that's great. I got hit fairly hard by HEB, but at this point I don't think HEB was given any raw deal. They had a chance to do this right and they fucked it up. Ampligen is nice for a number of purposes, and can help people, but HEB has so poorly mismanaged this drug over so many years that it's time to just put them down and let someone competent run with it. Sell this idea to GSK and move on. 

Otherwise, good to hear from you. I was trying to hold down the fort in your absence. Keep people calm and informed until you got here to lay down the law. "
2012-12-21 09:59:24,"In Montreal, don't got time to idle in chat n shit, I haven't jumped off a bridge or anything :P I nailed it yesterday lol. I told some people here I had sold on PM in docs, and I did. I had sold at a significant loss to the previous highs.

Yesterday I bought in morning... Stock wasn't halted. It was the most predictable trends to predict. The agenda is online. I sold near end of HEB presentation, which I thought was very convincing (I was hopeful), bought later before public testimonies, sold before vote, bought before the only question not related to trial accuracy (#3 I think), sold for a huge gain... What a wonderful day, I was completely exhausted by the end of it.

FDA is not approving Ampligen. They are simply unable to do so based off these trials. HEB got fucked over by the changing reviewing committees, maybe they thought they could get away with some bad conduct or something but it's clear that there is a substantial subset of CFS/ME sufferers who benefit hugely from this drug...

Too bad for CFS/ME sufferers that it will be another +10 years before the drug is up for approval again. I'm shocked that they are unable to make exceptions here, when they have dropped the ball with respect to CFS/ME for the past 20 years. I don't know what kool-aid the FDA is drinking but there are no other drugs out there, I won't be surprised to see a spike in suicides amongst CFS/ME sufferers in the near future :/

No ALXA raid this morning, I'm sad. I have a position in KERX for the weekend... What a fucking gongshow this week has been for biotech, thank god for HEB, I may have lost a lot of money if it weren't for my commitment to HEB."
2012-12-21 02:11:24,"ouch, lost quite the position here. So it looks like no approval, hopefully this one hurt less for others. Biggest loss so far in  bio trading for me."
2012-12-20 22:03:50,yep. Got in late at 5.50 but this should land very nicely tomorrow if everything pans out. Good luck !
2012-12-20 20:27:09,worst christmas present ever
2012-12-20 18:26:35,gotta agree with you there...
2012-12-20 18:13:04,So anyone else excited about their ALXA gains?
2012-12-20 18:09:12,"There were two safety votes. Basically, adcom says it is safe enough for now, but we still need more safety info in the long term. Which is good news for this approval process, admittedly. However, I'm still predicting a big drop tomorrow for every reason except shorts covering. "
2012-12-20 18:06:59,"I hear ya, one positive was that one of the votes went 8 yes 5 no for the safety of the drug for treatment, risk/benefit basically... the efficacy was the real issue. Even as they voted no, they said that they feel the drug has promise but the way the FDA question was worded to vote ""beyond a doubt"" of its efficacy they voted no. I'm no expert but I'm sure this will be touched on in the articles to come"
2012-12-20 18:00:48,"Goodluck! The final results are in. Is the safety and efficacy profile sufficient to support approval? 8 no, 5 yes, 1 abstain. Better odds than I was predicting, still not great. Remember, it doesn't matter how close it comes to yes, falling any short is the same as falling all the way short. "
2012-12-20 17:52:31,"I'm in now and might just hold until the run-up before the decision
"
2012-12-20 17:49:33,"Well, there isn't any good news in the short term, so be smart and look for a bottom IF you want to hold for either run-up or hold through decision. I am STRONGLY against holding through the decision. "
2012-12-20 17:45:03,"No way to short it. Was looking for a chance for days now. Only titans had a chance to short it, something like 50k or more. 

The adcom has only reported on efficacy at 9-4 negative. Which is surprisingly strong in the positive favor. 

Still have to wait to see what they say about safety. But the free-fall isn't over. And the massive swings were AH speculators, bulls and bears waging war without good info. In case it's not clear, the bulls got fucked BIG time. 

Also, I'm not touching it, for whatever that's worth. The PDUFA is very likely to be negative. "
2012-12-20 17:36:27,"I listened to this committee today and it seemed pretty bleak as far as the data goes. However, even the No votes admitted that the drug show promise but that more data is needed. The patient testimonials definitely swayed some of the votes in favor of Ampligen. it will be very interesting to see what direction the FDA takes in Feb... I personally don't believe all hope is lost here."
2012-12-20 17:30:52,"Damn, it was up at .47 a share at one point. Only wish I was quick enough to short it, its in the .20's after hours. 

If this trades down to below .20 like it was in the summer before the PDUFA runup is it worth a gamble? Even a few cents would yield a nice percentage. Any takers?"
2012-12-20 17:17:22,"Hope everyone dodged that dagger. If not, the adcom should be out soon, and we will try to make sense of it. Try to search for some good news, or something to suggest this is recoverable, though will almost certainly involve a very long position to recoup. "
2012-12-20 11:56:16,"I think the time to play RIMM was ~1 month ago. I held a far out of the money straddle, sold the call option last week for a net-gain. Still hoping to make most of my put option investment back after tonight as well. 

IMO the potential downside of a shitty report is much greater than the potential upside of a positive one at this point."
2012-12-20 10:42:46,[deleted]
2012-12-20 04:59:47,"Where has computar gone? =[  Bad week for Biotech, ONTY and FOLD both took 50% haircuts."
2012-12-20 01:45:54,"c0mputar, are you still holding this?  I agree with most of your plays, but HEB to me just looks like way too much risk.  The data seems shaky.  Good luck on ADCOM."
2012-12-19 17:33:58,"It is very expensive under the open-label use. But we now see that the efficacy reports are suspect. In any event, the pump-and-dump scheme would only work if there was some wild insider trading going on. Based on all the data presented, this seemed like a worthwhile drug. Otherwise, the data HEB released seemed to suggest they had something worth selling.

If HEB was honest and interested in collecting more data, it either would've been shown to be a whole hell of lot less efficacious, or they would have some basis for approval. If it had the ponies for approval, it would make some serious money as it would be the only drug competing in this market. 

Ampligen can still be useful as an adjuvant, or has potentiaal, but not under the piss-poor HEB management and their bat-shit crazy CEO. "
2012-12-19 17:24:53,"Ampligen is already available to patients under the FDA""s ""compassionate use"" program and it is barely used. So even though this drug may make some profits, its probably not going to be anything spectacular if the compassionate use numbers are any indicator."
2012-12-19 13:18:04,"I can't tell the future, but I am confident to say this much, adcom will almost certainly be bad, and that will likely cause the stock price to fall even more. Why hold through a rough patch like that? And there's no guarantee that HEB makes it right. Getting another FDA date takes a long time, and now they have added pressure of essentially lying to the FDA about what they've done in preparation for this accelerated process. 

My prediction: the price continues to fall with no good news in sight. So even if you think the management will heed the words and try to correct it, sell now and buy back in after the bad news has finished falling for a much cheaper price, or to get a much larger position. 

Surely you have better things to do with your money than to watch it lose value? ViVUS, CSIQ, JKS are all primed to do very well for an extended period going forward. 

Broadly speaking, the only time I would knowingly hold through rough patch is if there is good news from the company, and you don't want to miss it. Otherwise, HEB has no good news to offer. The only thing they can hope for is a HIGHLY benevolent adcom, very fast and decisive response to the adcom to fix things before the PDUFA, or a completely flukish PDUFA that completely ignores the adcom. 

In either case, I would say stay back until after adcom, and see what HEB does in response. Invest/trade on information, not on rolling some dice. "
2012-12-19 13:08:10,[deleted]
2012-12-19 13:02:21,"Sorry, this was not a pump and dump, it's a good idea that was horribly mismanaged. You need to be able to differentiate the two. 

Ampligen is a profitable drug, but HEB didn't do what they should have done. They had a chance to make a lot of money here, and they fucked it up. 

A pump and dump happens when some company has no value, or the value is wildly over-stated, simply to suck people in so the pumpers can get out and let someone else take a huge loss at their profit. Unless you're accusing $heff of running a pump and dump, then it's a misplaced criticism.  "
2015-02-15 03:42:54,Would much prefer a text post with brief synopsis and link. Quicker to deal with mentally.
2015-02-15 02:37:15,As long as it is not an obvious penny stock pump and dump blog then they should be allowed.
2015-02-15 02:07:22,i don't think you understand how this works. 
2015-02-15 01:19:08,"Agreed - this is a buy and hold forever* pick up, so not overly concerned with my entry point. "
2015-02-15 01:08:04,"Very true. I remember the end of 2012 w/ INTC @ 19-21 thinking it was a steal but never pulled the trigger. On the other hand, I thought MSFT was a sell but held on, so still came out OK."
2015-02-14 23:31:18,Bitch pls...
2015-02-14 22:50:45,"&gt;I really don't think write down is going to be that large... 

Do you have a reason to believe that, or are you just disagreeing with me because you have money riding on me being wrong (that's a good reason to consider that *you* might be wrong...)?

&gt; I'll just sit and wait but much of the cap ex spend is recent

That's really bad. That means the book value is even more overstated, because there isn't even any depreciation on that spend. It also guarantees there hasn't been any kind of writedown already.

You are acting as though you've found free money. You haven't. If an analyst finds a free money gold mine, you aren't going to hear about it until after all that free money is gone.

I spend a lot of time analyzing stocks and my first reaction is deep skepticism if I find something that looks like free money.

It should be your first reaction too.

Note that I'm not saying you can't make money here, but what you are really doing is going long oil."

2015-02-14 22:34:54,"Don't care too much, blogspam doesn't seem to be that much of a problem here.  IMO only extreme cases matter, like that one dude who's avoiding a shadowban by posting all his articles to different sites."
2015-02-14 22:34:03,"This guy has a good point and is spot on about rig values.  Check out rig counts. https://imgur.com/cnnmq69

I work at an E&amp;P and our costs are down 30%+ for drilling and completion, including rig costs.

edit: graph is for Texas based rigs only."
2015-02-14 22:20:23,"I really don't think write down is going to be that large... Again, I don't know so I'll just sit and wait but much of the cap ex spend is recent... They have a list of the equipment on front page of the site. An expert should pretty easily be able to discern what it's worth. Either way, I'm going to sit on this and pretty certain its going to work.

EDIT:  Again, shitty response by me. Liquidation value shouldn't have even been a term I used. Tangible Book is more so meant to show how loaded the spring is and how quickly it will go up if any developments are incrementally positive. Yes, right now you couldn't sell those rigs for as much but I'm of the belief that people are being as irrational now as they were when oil was over $100 a barrel.  So let's put it in the middle and say they can get 75-80% of tangible book recognized, I think this has 25-30% upside alone on that and more if they can turn profit."

Did you do any research into companies which facilitate LNG facilities as we slowly become less bearish into Q3 this year? 

I'm considering liquid nitrogen, cooling, companies that build those pipes, etc."
2015-02-14 20:26:16,"&gt; With machinery it's not the same thing... Forecast may not be accurate but with a piece of metal

I can tell you that rig prices are down precipitously (50%+ discount for old rigs). Last I checked those are made out of metal.

&gt; analysts should know what a rig would sell for right now and build it into numbers.

So you are using the analyst-calculated liquidation value (and you trust the analyst - some analysts have relationships with management)?

Because you said ""tangible book"" which is NOT the liquidation value and has nothing to do with analyst calculations."
2015-02-14 20:11:52,"Just don't agree with what you're saying. Most cases you are talking about acreage. With machinery it's not the same thing... Forecast may not be accurate but with a piece of metal, analysts should know what a rig would sell for right now and build it into numbers. Not the same situation you are talking about.

2015-02-14 19:56:52,"Great company with great balance sheet and good assets. Pretty much free money as oil recovers. Great management, okayish shareholder-friendly, price is a little high, dividend is high, but the risk is kind of low with that kind of company.

Pretty much a free ride to $30 in the coming months. Will post more detailed analysis later.

TLDR: Low risk oil play, but some other companies offer better risk/return profiles."
2015-02-14 19:54:57,I never understood why people were so drawn to intel stock after ~2000 Hint you would still be down ~15% 15 years later with no real potential upside outside of the bull market we have been in. Something as basic as PG or clx would place you at 30k presently on every 10k invested from 2000... So I must ask why bother with such a poor performer?

2015-02-14 17:33:20,"How big is their writedown gonna be?

Put another way - if they were to sell all their tangible assets at *actual* market prices (book value and liquidation value are *not* the same), what would they be worth?

Most O&amp;G minors are trading at a discount to book right now. It doesn't mean shit. Nobody wants to buy drilling equipment because nobody is drilling holes, so that equipment is nearly worthless (even though their depreciation model probably still shows it's worth lots).

the individuals whom sell these options, charge a premium. and the person that wrote them today, KNEW what they were doing. instead of apple tanking, apple rallied. they made the full premium.

2014-01-30 14:54:53,"No worries. I've already made it all back today on amzn. That's why I love options so much. When you lose big it's a 100% loss, but when you win big it's 300%+ gain. I am honestly shocked how UA reacted to the earnings especially compared to how hard other retail companies got his this quarter. "

2014-01-30 14:23:48,"Heres an article about the BlinkX situation:
http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f9b301b4-89b0-11e3-abc4-00144feab7de.html#axzz2ruT6upvP

Here is a highlight from Citi:
Arun George, technology analyst at Canaccord Genuity, agreed that Mr Edelman’s article was the trigger for the sell-off in Blinkx shares. “Clearly this guy is academic and has done some quite in-depth research,” Mr George said.
However, Blinkx’s house broker, Citigroup, said in a note: “We view this as a significant overreaction. We see no reason to think our numbers are unsound. . .We think this is a significant buying opportunity but at the same time acknowledge that until the company rebuts these claims, trading could be volatile.”
"
2014-01-30 14:15:12,"The same thing could be said for all stocks on a long enough timeline.  
  
Bethlehem Steel was a great multi decade pump and dump."
2014-01-30 14:15:01,"Yeah, I heard that you can buy rigs. I just want to buy a guaranteed % of a mining pool instead of owning the machine and doing the work."
2014-01-30 14:05:32,"I'm one of the people mining. From my point of view, I'd rather buy the pieces and put it together myself. But, there are some bigger companies that I think would rather buy an overpriced machine and get it chugging asap so I guess there's both sides.

I honestly don't see any obvious place for money to be made off of these coins besides mining and trading them."
2014-01-30 13:59:36,Apparel?  Man.  Do you even lift bro?  
2014-01-30 13:59:14,Sorry dude I can't see your reply in front of the giant pile of money in between me and my monitor.

2014-01-30 13:56:07,"There's one thing we know for sure: This stock is a scam, and will be lower in 3 months than it is today when manipulators decide to take profits. The question you have to ask yourself is: what amount of profit are you satisfied with? If you don't answer that, you're going to keep holding until you reach 10,000% or -50%. "
2014-01-30 13:52:11,"Setting up a server/website is a great idea, but look at what you just said. The cards are sold out...obviously shows huge demand :)"
2014-01-30 13:47:33,You can't reason with it. Just watch from a distance. 
2014-01-30 13:46:39,"I heard the most efficient graphics cards are sold out everywhere. I am not sure how much consumer graphics cards for coin mining would effect a companies bottom line though. Doesn't seem like it would move it much. You might try to hustle graphics cards to miners. 

Another way is to set up a website/server for mining pools."
2014-01-30 13:44:52,"That seems like one of the riskiest things I have ever heard. I think going on craigslist and loaning out money to people would be safer because at least you know they are in your court's jurisdiction and you can sue them if they fail to pay you back.

The only way I would do this if I could ensure the person was at least in the US and they could prove they have assets to pay me back and there were no liens attached to those assets."
2014-01-30 13:42:37,"Good Luck! That is a ballsy bet. Up until UA, I don't think there was a retail company that really had a strong holiday season. Before their earnings, I thought everyone might be bad but UA showed some companies did well. Maybe Amazon was the retailer that cleaned up. I am long shares."
2014-01-30 13:38:50,"Let the following sink in AP:

What happened: Completely mis-read the overall direction of the stock and luckily salvaging that wrong guess for a small gain on your position.

What you think happened: Saw there was room to the downside so you bought puts in the short-term. Then sold for a profit because, according to your trading rules, one shouldn't short tech companies.

You rationalized a bad trade that turned out lucky into a double win based on your skill.

Everyone has losses and wins. And it is better to be lucky than good. But when you cannot even recognize when you were lucky and turn that into skill, there is a serious problem with your outlook on life.

I love your posts and I think risk is great to some degree but you are essentially gambling your earnings and life away based on the belief that you have some kind of advantage. You do not have any advantage and thinking you do is in fact a huge disadvantage.

It's /r/wallstreetbets, right?"
2014-01-30 12:35:47,Right because the stocks I want to use this on are too risky to own on their own but have great upside potential.  Another reason I was going to give BS a try because I was assuming the illiquidity of the stock.

They all used to love facebook and then it slowly dawned on them that facebook fucked their favorite candidate out of a job.  Their confliction about the entire thing was so beautiful to watch.  I guarantee you that facebook is now public menace number uno (State dept. folks are, at the end of the day, pretty simple folk who are either on or off with respect to any given position or situation).

Personally, I like the entire situation because it points out the fucking hypocrisy of American democracy, as it seems Russia, some British outfit and two very American companies have end-run even the crazily liberal Citizens United ruling.

2019-04-16 19:29:58,"Tthe [NTSB report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY18MH010-prelim.pdf) literally says:

&gt; According to data obtained from the self-driving system,  the system first registered radar and LIDAR observations of the pedestrian about 6   seconds before impact, when the vehicle was traveling at 43   mph.As the vehicle and pedestrian paths converged, the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path. At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined that an emergency braking maneuver was needed to mitigate a collision (see figure 2). According to Uber, emergency braking maneuvers are not  enabled  while  the  vehicle  is  under  computer  control,   to reduce  the  potential  for  erratic  vehicle behavior. The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action. The system is not designed to alert the operator. 

Or the actual video that shows that there was enough time to brake, as well as the safety driver staring at her phone? It's not like I actually have to speculate, the evidence is pretty damning."

2016-03-01 13:12:14,"Objectively, it's a heavily indebted company whose stock has dropped 96% as the market has priced in its chances of going bankrupt from liquidity issues.  It formulated a restructuring plan to get out of debt and part of this scheme involved buying a company called Vivint Solar using money from its subsidiary, Terraform.  Since the deal happened, VSLR has dropped precipitously in value and a hedge fund manager with a large stake in TERP has gone to court trying to get TERP out of the deal.  Last week, a judge denied an injunction to TERP, thus green lighting the acquisition and suggesting that SUNE would not go bankrupt after all.  He expressed skepticism about the deal, though, and allowed for the case to go to trial to determine, even if the deal goes through, if TERP really has to pay.  

Unaided by TERP, SUNE could probably not pay for VSLR.  It is likely that they could find another buyer, but they would still face a $108 million shortfall due to the depreciation of VSLR.  VSLR earnings get released over the next few days, and we will see then.  Either way, SUNE is the highly volatile stock of a company with a very unclear future."

The copyright protection on the derivative works continues from the time such works were written. So Steamboat Willie can enter the public domain, but Goofy, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse and others don't spring into public use at the same time. Likewise the Fantasia story and other famous stories will still be protected. And frankly Mickey and Friends are a modest part of Disney's IP portfolio (compare, Star Wars, Marvel, all Disney produced Pixar properties, all Disney-Princesses).

Disney also maintains trademarks on all these characters, so while you could tell a Mickey Mouse story in 2023, you couldn't use the three-circle Disney mouse head to market it. On top of that, ""famous"" marks, like Mickey, have brand-tarnishment protection, so no legal production of Rule 34 Mickey Mouse art can easily come into being (there are some untested legal defenses here, but litigation would be very expensive)."

2021-05-16 14:25:08,Absolutely pokemon cards are legitimately super bullish right now. You can't even buy cards in store in the US right now. Every target or Walmart has a sign up saying they will only sell pokemon tcg items the day they get their truck for a 2 hour window at the beginning of the day.

Agreeement to buy or sell stocks/commodities etc. at a specific price on a specific date.

DJIA/S&amp;P500/Nasdaq Futures can be good indicators for market sentiment.
Should be taken into consideration, however aren't a guarantee.

The meme that futures don't matter is just that, a meme.
So yes you should keep an eye at futures."
