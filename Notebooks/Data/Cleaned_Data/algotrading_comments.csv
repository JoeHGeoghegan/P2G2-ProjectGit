2013-01-07 20:34:22,"I really would caution doing algorithmic trading on a virtualized system.  You have no control over anything, including CPU utilization, Network utilization, etc.  You may be physically close to a forex broker, but if someone else that is sharing the same physical system spikes their CPU, memory or network usage, your app could suffer from very hard-to-reproduce errors, and you could execute weird orders.  For example, your algo might set a limit order at the wrong price, etc, because of latency due to it being virtualized.

I would rather run on a home system with a regular DSL/Cable connection over a VPS, since I have 100% control over everything."
2013-01-07 18:14:00,"I'll try not to make this too self-serving, so as a preface - we are an NFA registered introducing forex broker in the US and one of our services is providing low latency VPS to clients - chances are if you trade enough we would cover your VPS (more info: http://bbfx.com/vps)

Regardless, I can tell you most of the FX brokers in the US are in one of the equinix DCs in and around NYC.  We use Commercial Network Services (http://www.commercialnetworkservices.com/VPS/Windows/Traders/) and Traders Colo (http://traderscolo.com/) - both designed for Forex traders in mind and both have locations in Equinix Datacenters, some are even cross-connected with brokers.

Hope this helps."

It would be interesting to add another extension point for interest rate related costs/gains such as returns on cash and the cost of borrowing for short sales. We'd love help, if you're up for some python coding.

If you're going to look at financial stocks using Yahoo data, for instance, things can look pretty rosy.  But that's only because Yahoo doesn't show you what happened to Lehman and other banks that went belly-up!

Yahoo also doesn't do that great at tracking ""corporate actions"" like stock splits, dividends, acquisitions, etc.  Look at [IAC/Expedia in 2008 on Yahoo](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=IACI%20Interactive#symbol=iaci;range=5y;compare=;indicator=;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) as an example.  See that giant cliff-like drop?  That's actually a reverse stock-split and a spinoff, not a crash.

I work for a company called [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/?utm_source=dan&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=download-data).  We offer free access to minute-level bar US stock data that is free of survivor bias and includes corporate actions.  Check out that same [IAC chart](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/smooth-data-for-iac?utm_source=dan&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=download-data) using our data rather than Yahoo's.  

Unfortunately, we don't offer this data for download - our license doesn't permit it.  But if you can write some code in Python, you can test the data using our API.  We provide sample ideas to get started.

2014-01-30 02:00:14,"&gt;33 sigma...

Assuming the universe is 14 billion years old and that you're measuring events at intervals of 1 Planck second, which according to quantum mechanics is the smallest unit of time that can be measured, then the probability of what you observed would require more time than the entire universe has existed.

The above is actually an understatement, it would actually require more time than the universe is expected to exist according to the heat death model of the universe, an event which is expected to happen in 10^150 years from now.

Believe it or not... my last paragraph is also an understatement but I simply have no other concept by which to express how unlikely a 33 sigma event is.  At any rate, my point is that you likely did not really observe a 33 sigma event, but only miscalculated one.

&gt;**Virtual bidding** is a strategy implemented in various [Independent System Operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_System_Operator) electricity markets of trading Day-Ahead prices against Real-Time (or Hour-Ahead) prices. The term ""bid"" can be used loosely in electricity markets to refer to an offer to buy or to sell. And the term ""virtual"" is used to refer to the fact that, while these trades occur in a physical market, virtual trades never entail taking a physical position—because every sell (or buy) Day Ahead will be closed by a buy (or sell) in Real Time. The ISO maintains a trade execution system that ensures all virtual positions will be closed before delivery time. A virtual bidding platform gives financial entities a way to participate in these physical markets, with no physical assets or presence on the grid. They can attempt to capitalize on regular divergences between these markets of different time period for the same underlying (perhaps using time, absolute price levels, or other external variables as conditioning factors). If this strategy of trading one time period against another without the intent (or perhaps even the ability) to deliver or receive physical power is implemented outside of a transaction system that identifies virtual bids and ensures they will be closed, it may be referred to as ""implicit"" virtual bidding. Virtual positions are included in the same simultaneous feasibility tests and price determination processes as real positions. Thus they can serve to reduce inefficiencies in the market.

2014-01-29 21:45:23,"As someone who runs a trading firm your company is right to shut down that algo based on the information you supplied and I would have done the exact same thing.

You represent that your algo lost 1 million dollars in a single day due to what you claim is a market under-reaction, or really just a series of events that you were unable to forsee or predict.  Another series of events that you likely also didn't forsee or predict had you making 12 million or possibly 100 million dollars or a bazillion dollars, who knows...

Yes, it's possibly that when the market behaves in ways one can not predict one can make a significant sum of money, but that's irrelevant.  The most important aspect of an algorithm is predictability and adherence to a model.  If your algorithm can not accurately model the market that represents a fundamental risk to your firm, regardless of whether the inability to predict the market happens to result in a large gain or a large loss on some particular day.

Once it's established that the algorithm is unable to accurately model the market, the company must shut it down.  It's never worth it to risk an entire firm's capital on a bet like that, even if the bet would happen to pay off.  The downside is that the firm ends up losing a great deal of money and laying off staff or even closing down its doors (which happens quite a bit).

It might suck to hear that and it might seem unfair, but from the point of view of the firm it was the right decision to make.  If it really really is the case that your algo can reliably produce profits and predict market trends as opposed to simply lucking out and making a bazillion dollars from some one time fluke, then the burden is on you to present that case, show the data, produce the evidence and take it from there.

It's a tough business but that's the way it really has to be."

I would look into reading Benoit Mandelbrot's *The (Mis)Behavior of Markets*, specifically where he talks about [alpha-stable distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution) in the cotton markets.  It was a great way to help me start thinking about volatility in different ways.

&gt; I want to calculate the probability for each event of whether it had a (more than negligible) effect

For this, I'd look into trying to discern some kind of an [Impulse Response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response) based on certain events."

Consider the following game. There is a bag with 1000 balls. Each ball has a unique positive number printed on it no greater than say 10000. In the first situation, you are to randomly pick 10 balls, then all the numbers of the balls remaining in the bag will be increased by some amount, you are then to place the balls you've selected back into the back, whilst at random picking a new ball from the bag. The difference in the numbers is accumulated. Given this situation, would you on average have a positive or negative total?

Would it be possible to come up with a number denoting the minimum number of rounds such that the total will always be positive after that many rounds have passed?

2014-01-11 05:41:15,"Apologies.  I was actually just looking at the picture before I saw your comment and I realized it probably wouldn't make much sense to someone unfamiliar with the software (Metatrader 5).  

Here's an explanation:

I've coded my trading strategy with a number of variables, such as take profit, stop loss, RSI period, RSI stoch, buy signal threshold, etc.
For each variable I set a range of values that I want the software to run through.  For example, we could try a stop loss value from 5 to 25.  The software then goes through the training set many, many times with some values for each of the variables and sees how the strategy performs.  We then pick the best strategy of all of the trials (here best means most profitable).

It's a bit hard to see, but if you zoom in there are dates along the x axis at the bottom.  It's just one picture and the left side is earlier in time than the right side.

First the algorithm was optimized over the right region of time (black line to end) and the line shown is the best result obtained after optimization. Account balance is on the y axis.

Now, that strategy looks pretty good right? It turned $4000 into $11500 in around 7 months and only lost two trades.  Too good to be true? Yep.

So then we backtest (run the strategy over an earlier region of time it never trained for) and see that the strategy is terrible.  A 5 year test confirmed that it sucks everywhere else :)
 
What happened is we overtrained the strategy to that one section of time.  Sure it performs amazing there, but it loses
everywhere else. A simple solution is to train over a longer time period, or not train for as long (avoid overtraining).  If you optimize a 
strategy over a small time period (week, month, year, even a couple years) for a long time, you will get an amazing reported profit
but its really unlikely the strategy will work elsewhere.


I hope that makes sense, ask away if you have more questions.

Lemme 'splain...

With SPY, there are no grounds for stating whether or not today's action is related to yesterday's. The SPY **is not** a coin flip - it's a reflection of the aggregate of millions of independent decisions - and the only thing we can say for certain about today vis-a-vis yesterday is that it follows it in time. 

A beginning trader **has to** do this kind of statistical analysis to know what degree of correlation exists. The results he got are what we would expect, (that it is roughly equivalent to a coin flip), but he can't know that going in. I think his analysis is absolutely essential for a beginning trader.

Having said all that, thank you for pointing out the difference between a positive win:loss ratio and positive expectancy. "

2014-01-07 04:48:37,"Hi Chainsaw,

The best way to get started on this sort of analysis is with the 'pandas' library (http://pandas.pydata.org/). It provides a lot of out of the box functionality to carry out many of the tasks you describe. In particular, you can download large datasets with it. It also provides sophisticated date alignment of data-sets and basic data analysis methods. There's a ""ten minutes guide to pandas"" video which is also helpful (http://vimeo.com/59324550). 

To install it you'll need NumPy and SciPy installed too, which can sometimes be problematic to get working! You may find the free Enthought Canopy IDE (https://www.enthought.com/downloads/) will save you some time as well.

2014-01-02 17:44:24," 1. This is generally not a good IDEA!!!!!

As you would need to do a loop with the probability up to some point t and then use your estimate to trade after point t.

You can compare this to buy and hold (You should beat it).

 2. I did it in R, load your favourite sp500 object or stock to replace, quantmod is being weird for me today.

You can do counts too but I preferred avg return after the events.

If you have a model that will consistently score 51% of the time, factoring in losses,  you'll be wealthy. That is impossible unless you control the market,  are Jesus+1, or are a time traveler. "
2014-01-02 15:27:49,"I applied the code to the past 5203 trading days and found out that yes, the occurrence of a positive close given 2 previous negative closes is .556, while a positive close is .54, which I interpret as a very very small dependency. Is that wrong?


Regarding profitability:
Using the PG2N strategy, the average gain was +0.87, while average loss was -0.82, with winning occurrences being .556. Simply buying stock would have yielded 144%, while buy and hold yielded 221% (not including dividends). EV: +.119


Using Positive Given **3** Negative days strategy, average gain was .84, while average loss was -.875. But, the winning occurrences were much higher: .60. (288/480) That gives the strategy an expected value of +.15


Positive given **4** negative days happened much less. The signal hit 185 times out of 5203, and successes were 117. That gives the occurrence of .63, which had average an gain of +0.875% and average loss of -0.915%. The strategy has an expected value of +.12


Any thoughts on this? Can a strategy with lower average gains than losses, but higher chance of profitability be profitable in the long run?"
2014-01-02 12:48:06,"I appreciate the response. Like I mentioned, I'm not especially trying to find a profitable trade here, just trying to apply some Python knowledge. You bring up two great points. 


I think there can be a thoughtful discussion about the dependency of each event. Here's my take:


Every day, traders and investors are trying to gain insight about the market. Most of us have the same information about the economy. Most of us believe in corrections, dips, and general trends. If you are a smart investor or trader, and you see the market dip two days in a row *without news to back those movements,* you might think that there was a small correction, and that its a good time to buy. 


What I'm attempting to do is quantify how many days of losses it will take for the market to rebound. I'm probably thinking of this the wrong way--maybe there's no signal here. Reviewing the idea, it seems similar to gambler's fallacy.. if movement of the market is totally random, not guided by investor behavior. I'm still a student, so I appreciate you humoring me and discussing this."
2014-01-02 12:14:13,"Agreed with you on the concepts you present re: conditional probability and algo profitability.

Regarding the actual dependency of the SPY vs itself though, intuitively subsequent days are related (hence the existence of trends).  More quantitatively though we could just establish whether or not the SPY is auto-correlated.  If it is, then OP should be able to use his method.

Someone's done autocorrelation testing for the SPY to an extent here: http://www.mathestate.com/tools/Financial/r06/MarketData.html
"
2014-01-02 05:41:41,"First off, you can't use conditional probability in a situation where there is no dependency between events, ie today's probability of a positive close has no dependency on yesterday's result.   It's a misuse of probability. It's akin to flipping a coin ten times and using that result to predict what the next coin flip will be. It won't matter, the coin flip will still be 50/50 regardless of the previous flips. 

Second, 62.5% chance of profit isn't enough. You need to quantify the profits vs the losses as well. If there's a 62.5% chance of a $100 win but a 37.5% chance of a $300 loss then the algo will be net unprofitable. "
2014-01-02 05:34:12,"I'm a coder but I know nothing about trading so I'll answer the first two:

1. It really depends what format your data is in. You could read it from a CSV file with the Python `csv` module, or pull it from a database. Take a look at the `pandas` library, which might be overkill for your project but it's good to know that it's out there in future.

2:

- Instead of doing `i=0...while i&lt;40...i+1` it's a bit cleaner to just do `for i in xrange(40):`

- Use `len(dailyReturns)` instead of `40`, that way you can change the dailyReturns variable without breaking the rest of the program.

- It's a bit over-commented. Comments such as ""end while loop"" aren't very helpful (and if you feel the need to put that in, it probably means your block of code is too long to be readable). Unnecessary to put comments beside `posStreak = 0` etc in my opinion, since the variable is already explained when it's defined.

- Some things can be done outside of the while loop. e.g. `totalDays = len(dailyReturns)`, `SpyReturn = sum(dailyReturns)`

- The Python style guide is called PEP 8. The standard in Python is naming variables all lowercase with underscores (no camel-case). These things aren't so important for a small script, but you should be aware of it if you're ever working with other developers.

- Possible bugs: 
    - Cases are handled for the dailyReturn&gt;0 and &lt;0, what happens if it equals 0?
    - If there is a positive or negative streak on the last day, the program will crash because of the `i+1`

I know people who have used ANNs for more than two decades, so they seem to work. But without knowing more about your application there is no way to tell what your issue is. It might even be the case that there simply is no helpful hidden information in/preceding a price gap, so there is no practical way to predict what happens next.

I have found SVMs to be useful when used to identify entry points. ANNs are great when they work but a) it's harder to get them to work and b) they take up much more performance. SVMs are much quicker to train and to test. We are looking for patterns after all, so why not use the best better matcher we have instead of a massive general learning model? Also, I can see that there should be value in using markov chains/HMMs to predict future price very similarly to voice recognision. But I don't know much about them. I also want to try a convolutional ANN or a Hopfield net for pattern matching but haven't had the time, yet. "

For example if your model trades orders on Limits, its safe to assume lower slippage, then say stops.  In general for futures trading on Stops a safe bet is about 30 dollars/round turn for slippage, execution &amp; clearing costs.  For Limit Orders, 15/round turn.

I don't know about options, but probably at least the spread + 10% + commission &amp; clearing charges."

Also large amount of data may or may NOT cause cache missing. It depends on the algorithm and how it optimizes. For example, we can split the data to hot data and cold data. We can make the hot data adjacent in the memory to improve cache hit. Cold data can spread in the memory anywhere because the data is rarely used so cache missing is not a problem. Just an example. There are several ways to improve cache hit, reducing data set size is only one of them.

I think this is fundamentally at odds with the notion of **portfolio** margin, where by definition the margin required for a new position is also a function of existing positions.

Even if IB provided the breakdown of each position's contribution to the current portfolio margin requirement, they would only be valid for the current portfolio and time. They could conceivably all change due to a single position change, or even market movements alone.

Rather than relying on IB's margin calculation, I'd suggest you derive an exposure metric independently. Afraid I can't contribute much here as I don't have much experience with options. "

I am not sure, but wouldn't be too surprised if IB kept the formula they use proprietary.

You have to main options here.  You could switch to Reg T, which is easier to keep track of.  Or, you can stop trying to squeeze every last penny of margin out of IB.  If you are even close to the limit, IB thinks you are risking too much for them to bankroll.  You should probably listen to them

Gox used uniform pricing and actually kept the difference instead of passing off the savings onto the maker of the trade. 

Finding this rule out by having it done to you, is probably the worst way to find out. "

Pointing out and complaining about flaws in a system doesn't solve anything, propose and push for solutions instead.

Yes, Mt. Gox lost a lot of people a lot money. No, that probably wouldn't have happened if insurance or regulatory oversight was in place. But as the MF Global reference proves, it's still possible. That's why I believe solutions will be more technical (ie. Multisignature wallets used by bitcoin custodians)."

Equal to mtgox and bitstamp? Did you get lost on your way to /r/bitcoin? People here tend to understand that a small risk is not equal to a large risk.

FYI Paul Tudor Jones and Peter Borish used this same technique in the late 80s. They compared the then-current Dow chart to the one just before the 1929 crash and found a very high correlation. This was their reason for being heavily short heading into Black Monday:

&gt;Investment Corporation for whom Borish was the right-hand man, says he anticipated the crash in 1987 because Borish had mapped the 1987 market against the market preceding the 1929 crash, and noted the similarity between the two markets."

2016-02-15 19:15:19,Awesome thanks! I'll take a look at this
2016-02-15 17:23:34,"I'd be interested, can you narrow it down at all to give me a better idea is whether I'd find it applicable? Industry, etc?"

2016-02-15 11:27:21,"Several hurdles:

1) Getting the data

2) Actually accomplishing the transaction (E.G. you can send an order to an exchange electronically--there is no ""this player is offline"" type of nonsense)

3) Sometimes there are differences in the items (this is for loot grinding type games like, say, Diablo) that you might need a model to account for.

Far from easy/simple."

So test it yourself, on a wide variety of situations, and get back to us.

Edit: or hire someone who can."
2017-03-16 19:12:48,"Ok. So it's a weighted average because you are using machine learning to discover those weights. I thought you were weighting the sums of the two forecasts into a combined forecast and then throwing that into machine learning. For example, giving the 4 - 16 forecast 65% and the 64 - 256 forecast 35%. But that's not what you are doing.

Cool, I was planning on throwing each forecast normalized to -1to1 and the combined forecast normalized to -1to1 in my neural network as three more inputs to what I already have. Hoping to make some slight improvements to my accuracy. Currently getting a Sharpe Ratio of just under 0.9.

Yes, good advice on big trending markets. I'm working with a big futures market. Any of that horizontal stuff can kill a good trending strategy.

Thanks for the explanations!"
2017-03-16 18:42:20,"It's more like 1 to -1. So 1 would be strong buy, -1 would be strong short, and 0 would be no position. If you were doing long only, you'd do 0 to 1. 

When you add them together, you normalise the combined signal too, so you'll still end up in the range -1...1. 

Some signals are better than others. To find reasonable weights, you need to have a lot of data to backtest on, and use a statistical technique called bootstrapping, and finally an optimizer which will tell you what combination of weights works best. It's a lot of work and kind of pointless though- I can tell you that even splitting those indicators I gave you will produce reasonably good results.

One more thing about trend following. It tends to work better for big markets that trend (eg futures, currencies), and not so well for stocks, which tend to have sudden price shocks that this formula can't predict. "
2017-03-16 18:20:25,"Ah. Thanks. That makes more sense. Ok, so with the 0to1 normalized and then summed forecasts, you are left with a strongest buy signal at 2 and a strongest sell signal at 0...or the equivalent for whatever normalization one decides to use. Yeah?

What's the purpose of the weighted average you mention? Are you prioritizing one of the two forecasts over the other?"

2017-03-16 08:51:32,"I use the same exact strategy for all those things, so imo it doesn't really matter from a tech perspective. You won't get accurate volume stats for forex though as the market isn't centralized. 

The one thing that might influence your decision is the amount of equity you have. I wouldn't trade futures with less than $25k, whereas you could take a shot at forex way earlier. For stocks you need way more capital to really bank good money unless you use options. 

Personally, I strongly prefer futures over everything because the volatility of oil/gold/S&amp;P futures is godly :D"

2017-03-16 06:12:19,"I've been thinking about this. Doesn't summing or averaging two moving averages just give you a correlate for a single moving average that is somewhere between the two moving averages?

So you sum an EMA4 and EMA16 and divide by 2. Don't you just get something like an EMA10? Same with averaging an EMA64 and EMA256. Wouldn't that give something like an EMA160?

If so, aren't you just looking at the crossover of an EMA10 and an EMA160?

I feel like I'm missing something in the complexity."

Contrary to popular belief, HFT algorithms are much more vanilla than what most people make them out to be. There's nothing particularly interesting about entry/exit aside from the fact that holding periods are in the range of sub-seconds to seconds. This also means that it's inherently low risk; the only 'risk management tactics' you need are sanity checks to ensure your firm doesn't meet the same fate as Knight Capital. There's also risks that you need to account for, but can't do anything about, e.g. slippage.

Technical indicators aren't used; decisions typically aren't made on the spot, otherwise that wouldn't be low-latency code. At firms like mine that mainly does high-frequency market making and arbitrage, technical indicators wouldn't give us any more useful information."

2017-03-14 21:50:46,"Pair trading using Bollinger Bands just measures how much the pair has diverged from the norm (usually the 20 day moving average). There are lots of possible strategies because you can use many different moving average lengths and many different STD levels. You can also do things like only enter the pair trade after it passes the 2.0 STD level by a buffer amount (like .25) and then starts going back down again and hits the 2.0 level. This way you are trying to catch the pair while it is contracting.

As an alternative to Bollinger Bands, you can also do a type of intraday pair trading where instead of using STD, you start fresh each day and use the percentage the pair diverged since the market opened, instead of the Bollinger Band level. Like if the pair diverges more than .50% that day, you would enter the pair trade hoping the prices would converge back to normal by the end of the day. Or instead, you could base the divergence percent on the overnight move, and enter when the market opens."

&gt;What do customers want most? 
&gt;
&gt;Whats the most sought after and highly paid customer request?
&gt;
&gt;What skills do you want to improve that would gain you more customer business?
&gt;
&gt;Where do you get your customers? 

I use python, it's the best and fastest language for this purpose. 

I am not actively looking for customers they seem to find me as I am active in the algorithm trading local community. I just agree as a side gig, I already have the knowledge and it may help another person and it's a good way to make extra cash. 

I need to tune my parameters so I can have a low risk algorthim, once I do that I can find all kind of customers. In this kind of business word of mouth travel faster than anything else. Once you have generated reasonable returns to one customers they will come flocking.

I would like to emphasize that I don't design they algorthim what I get is a strategy and they require from me to automate it. I don't design algorthim at all for anyone else but myself, i just program and automate Thier own strategies.

Designing and selling algorthim is risky and hypocritical in my opinion. If you have a successful low risk algorthim you should use it yourself and run it. All the algorthim that's out there for sale don't work. Algorthim by themselves don't work. To make it work you need very deep knowledge in how it work so you can tune in parameters as needed . There is no easy way to make money without money, however some roads are less difficult than others.

The reason why people hate data science orachine learning or algorthim that it's not only require deep understanding of the subject, it requires you to tune in parameters. Sometime I had to run an algorthim for more than 1000 times just to tune a parameter or two, or solve part of it. for my news data mining script it took years of working on it optimizing it. It's fun but it requires grinding day out and day in just like anything else.

However the advantage of algorthim trading that once you hit gold, you will see gold. Plus you can do it anytime and anywhere. For me this mean I can work in my day job and work on it after work and the weekend, other side businesses takes time and managing and legal issues."

2017-03-14 02:06:37,"Answer: Myself.
Why?: Because my strategies work. Really. Well. Why give up the majority of the returns to investors when you can keep them all yourself? Truth/caveat: Limited scale in my strategies.

Been doing what I do for the past decade+ and make 7 figures a year doing it. Started with $10K a decade ago.

It's *much* harder now, and if I was entering the space today I probably couldn't make sufficient returns to start with &lt;$10K and turn it into millions again, but.... I didn't. I started a decade ago and it was crazy easier and I did. So now I'm established and here. IMO the real bullshit change is the cost of data. Nowadays if you want to access the best data to compete in the really cool spaces it costs $30-$150K/month just to get the data. Nobody can startup in an environment like that. Favors established players. IMO SEC should look at that.

My strategies don't scale well. I can't manage a 9 figure fund, as much as I'd like to (and have had offers to). So, I'm stuck making single digit millions algo trading. Is it bad? Hell no. Is it great? Also no. I want more, but thus far, haven't been able to hit that home run.

2017-03-14 01:03:31,how big are the moves? 
2017-03-14 00:53:31,"I believe this is right. Bollinger bands are just a measure of volatility. 

Kalman filters take a noisy stochastic process and filter it. One approach I believe is generate many (eg. 50) stochastic/GARCH forecasts, then filter the group using a Kalman filter into a single 'underlying' volatility model. Maybe someone will correct me. However, Bollinger bands use historical change meaning you could forecast future volatility for a forward looking indicator. Similarly, I think some traders use market implied volatility.

The alternative to volatility modeling is to improve the statistical fit. Standard deviations assume a normal distribution with i.i.d. variables, neither which capture random market prices. There are methods such as using autocorrelation to adjust the SD for a less-biased estimate. You might also be able to use a fatter tailed distribution. I would like to note the relationship between the SD and a z-score, which assumes ~N(0,1), but I can't help much with this area either.

If you are unfamiliar with cointegration, I would investigate there for pairs trading to see if it's something you like. Sometimes linear statistical relationships exist by lagging one of the pairs t-1 etc. If you are a die-hard technical trader, maybe investigate rate-of-change - which do not confuse with volatility."
2017-03-14 00:15:54,"Let me clarify.

Im creating a backtest using a python backtesting framework which requires OHLC data. I downloaded DukasCopy tick data.. which is presented in bid/ask/bid volume/ask volume. When I use pandas to create OHLC, it creates both ask OHLC and bid OHLC. So I first have to ""groupby"", but not sure which to use"
2017-03-14 00:06:47,"neither! you use trades/matches for OHLC, not book entries.  use the book when you want to attempt to calculate your execution prices"
2017-03-13 22:49:54,from what 
2017-03-13 20:10:36,"Could you be confusing quotes from trades? Trades work better for OHLC because it's easier to say 'someone else took that price, so I could have'. Quotes have less meaning since some use them as tools to ignite trading. 

If you trade small, then a simple mid price reflects 'no arbitrage' round trip transaction costs. To extend this, you could weigh the midprice with bid/ask size to account for supply and demand. You could even use the last price to measure distance to the bid/ask, but this requires using both quotes and trades.

If this for whatever reason is a particular concern, you might start with Roll's measure which adjusts for autocorrelation for the 'fundamental value' around the midprice. If you trade large enough, then OHLC using quotes does not reflect depth of the market, and impact-based models VWAP or TWAP may estimate cost better.

Since the bid/ask are two distinct prices for the same good, the law of one price begs the question of parity. In reality it's information risk, in an economic sense, which determines the limits of arbitrage. Instead of using a single price, which assumes completeness, you could always use a bid-ask matrix. I would just use the mid-price for simplicity's sake."

Even professional data vendors can get volumes wrong. There's the question of whether the volume was from one exchange (usually) or aggregated across the whole country.

My suggestion is to develop a strategy without volume data. Sometimes, you have to consider 'open' price missing too."

2018-01-31 18:22:58,Simple approach is to take local high/low (also called maxima/minima) over a fixed period e. g. 50 bars. Use school maths to find turning points (dy/dx =0). Use school maths again to find maxima or minima (d2y/dx). You then have a list of local min max values. If 2 or more have similar (introduce a variation factor to your price like 5% +/-) price you found a horizontal support. For non horizontal support lines project local min with other mins using linear function y=kx+m. Or try to fit many mins to the line using ols. The more mins from your list fit the stronger your support line

There may of course constraints that force you to invest a minimum absolute amount, like the margin requirements of a futures contract."

Ok, let's cool down everybody. OP might have been too harsh, but I agree with the main point he was trying to make, i.e. assuming that we can execute at the last traded price is very very different from a real market situation. Also, *everybody* that I know of who tried to implement LSTMs, CNNs or any other overly complex machine learning model to beat financial markets got his ass kicked in live environments. No matter what background they had, no matter how sophisticated their approach was, no matter how large their training set was... They all got wrecked. Everybody.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; There's no patterns in price actions. Therefore no technical analysts make money. 

It's not about whether there are patterns, but whether you can exploit them. It's possible that there are markets which follow specific patterns at certain times, while at the same time no known model is advanced enough to exploit these patterns. Financial markets are *extremely* complex and are often underestimated by researchers. I have seen that so many times over the years.

But hey, I still like your project and since you open sourced everything, it will give curious newcomers a great starting point to play around. Wish you the best and give us a heads-up on how live trading is going."

Asking for books or papers to read is something people won't do either. Most of the work is the research and the understanding, and no one will tell you how. Besides, no book or paper will tell you how to make a strategy either.

2018-01-30 01:07:00,"You're struggling because you're viewing your securities as no more than a ticker symbol with fluctuating prices. These securities represent something, many things. For example, SPY is a combination of all its constituents. It is a combination of the smaller sectors. You can find relationships between the security and the underlyers. ES is all that plus interest. Did you know that SPY is convertible into its underlyers and you can take a giant basket of the underlyers to convert into SPY? These relationships form the foundations for the hypothesis for you to test. You're not big enough or fast enough to do a strategy converting SPY baskets, but you definitely can do something like WMT and the products that they sell. WMT accounts for &gt; 30% of sales of many small companies' products. You could use one as a predictor of the performance of the other. The alpha that you can extract depends on the quality and novelty of this research. The complexity of the research determines how much competition you will run into when executing the strategy. Data like this is generally not readily available, or available in a low quality and quantity. You'll have to do some digging and automation. You can come up with strategies where the input data isn't even security prices.

2018-01-29 21:46:11,"The vol target strategy would rebalance the ratio of SPY/TLT based on the volatility of SPY, either daily, weekly, or monthly (trading cost would obviously impact the cost of rebalancing). You could pair SPY with any low risk asset, as the other asset is to be used as a 'risk-off' asset. This is basically a simpler form of two asset version of mean variance optimization (modern portfolio theory/markowitz).

As per the resources, I would recommend Quantopian tutorial and lecture series, and Wiki articles. As you test basic ideas you get a feel of what works and what doesn't, and you occasionally you run into algorithms on books, blogs, or Quant forums that are actually quite viable. I think Quantopian really has a great community which is the best - and perhaps the only - thing they got going for them. Check out the following blogs as well:

2018-01-29 14:02:15,"""Distribution"" is the keyword ... ""distribution"" ..."
2018-01-29 13:46:21,"I tried to address both of those points in the article I linked.

When the demo file imports quantrocket, it’s importing the open-source [client library](https://github.com/quantrocket-llc/quantrocket-client), not anything proprietary. So there’s no mixing of GPL and proprietary code here. You’re thinking of `quantrocket` as one thing but it’s a mix of open source and proprietary components and those components are separate. As an analogy, Amazon’s [client library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) is open source (Apache 2.0) but the code that runs AWS itself is obviously proprietary. How Amazon or anyone else combines the AWS client library with other packages has no bearing on what Amazon does with their server-side code. 

Regarding installing backtrader in a Docker container, this is where mere aggregation applies. The Docker container contains all sorts of programs, including standard Linux programs, Python packages including the backtrader package (if the user installed it), and a binary containing proprietary QuantRocket code. The key point is that the proprietary binary never imports backtrader; it only knows how to forward commands from the end user to the OS (via the subprocess module). So if the end user forwards a command to run a backtrader script, the backtrader script will be run in its own process, not inside the binary. According to the GPL, programs that communicate in this way are separate programs, and the license of one has no bearing on the other. "
2018-01-29 13:12:22,"That was already explained in private. From your own documentation:


    import backtrader.feeds as btfeeds
    from quantrocket.history import download_history_file
    ...

That strikes me as your `quantrocket` module in the same program as the `backtrader` module ... but I may be completely wrong of course and that may be a case of *mere aggregation* or as you also mentioned in the past, *fair use*.

From your documentation again

    # docker-compose.yml
    services:
        ...
        satellite:
            image: 'quantrocket/satellite:latest'
            volumes_from:
                - codeload
            environment:
                PIP_INSTALL: 'backtrader&gt;=1.9'

Ooops ... the excuse here is ... we are not distributing ... but we are telling the world how to distribute a GPL package along with proprietary code. Of course without mentioning that anyone who publishes that `dockerfile` is bound by the terms of GPL, i.e.: bound to hand the source code. Who cares about informing about obligations.

It should suffice to prove that you are not respecting the GPL terms and that your understanding of the GPL is flawed.

And you draw people to confusion (like the poster above) because they will say: *quantrocket comes with backtrader*. And **NOT** they cannot be together. Thank you.

@mementix, I fear we’ve gotten off to a rocky start, but I’m very interested in exploring possible ways to work together, if you’re open to it!"
2018-01-29 08:58:56,"Hi there, I’m the main developer behind QuantRocket. 

I can see how there might be an appearance of GPL license infringement, not having a more detailed understanding of QuantRocket’s architecture. For this reason I’ve added a page to our website that provides detailed transparency about how the backtrader integration in the example docs works: 

https://www.quantrocket.com/opensource/gpl/

In a nutshell, as QuantRocket is a suite of loosely coupled microservices rather than a monolithic binary, QuantRocket and backtrader are ""merely aggregrated"" and are separate programs in the eyes of the GPL. 

@mementix, I hope you’ll review the linked article and I hope it clarifies that we’re fully respecting the terms of your license. I welcome your feedback."
2018-01-29 07:51:36,An example would be take the average of the past 20 days of a stock.  If it goes above that average then you sell.
2018-01-29 07:31:01,"**Mean reversion (finance)**

In finance, mean reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move to the average price over time.

Using mean reversion in stock price analysis involves both identifying the trading range for a stock and computing the average price using analytical techniques taking into account considerations such as earnings, etc.

When the current market price is less than the average price, the stock is considered attractive for purchase, with the expectation that the price will rise. When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall.

If a you're trading stocks and something you're watching jumps up 20%, and if you're using mean reversion, based on some other factors, you expect the stock to come back down to wherever its average is (revert to the mean).

Data: for many markets, daily equity data can be had from Google or yahoo finance.  There any also be other sites like quantiacs or quantopian or trade view that may help too. 

Testing: for back testing you will just need a spreadsheet with your price data, so it doesn't have to be online at all. For forwarding testing, you will need to be online during trading hours. 

Shortcuts: for equities, fundamental valuation / accounting / corporate finance tools are a must. Other than that, reading about how other traders trade can give you other ideas about how to trade. Lastly, delving into market theory and structure will be very useful. 

My experience: I got lucky in that I have a fairly deep understanding of markets, so my first go at algo trading was profitable but far from production-readying. In the time since, I've been refining my technique and should be production ready soon.  I don't make a living at algo trading yet but that's my goal for 2018.  

Do fundamentals matter: Absolutely.  However, their power lies in setting longer term asset prices. In the shortest terms, prices are mostly set by supply and demand.  Here your desired trading timescale will determine how much fundamentals matter to your strategy.  "
2018-01-29 06:51:45,"Sorry for being this late in getting back! Let's dive in!

Statistical arbitrage is a good methodology for trading, provided your markets are liquid enough for prices to correct in the direction of fundamental valuations. A decent example is the dow Jones (industrials) etf, DIA. The fundamental valuation of DIA is equal to the share price of each dow stock * it's respective weight in the dow. However, the supply / demand effects of trading mean that often DIA is under or over valued compared to Dow. Stat arbs would seek to trade the value difference away. 

Time scales: I meant that your desired trading frequency should be back tested against data at the same time scale. That is of you want to trade (1 buy or 1 sell) daily then you should be backtesting using daily data too. 

Assets: I suggested stocks because daily stock data is often free and the markets are liquid enough for all valuation theory to hold. Also stocks have a clearly understood intrinsic value which makes them easier to develop trading strategies for. Further, stocks are the underlying asset for many derivatives; so understanding stocks will help you understand and trade other assets later.  

Books:  a basic corporate finance textbook ( fundamentals of financial management by Brigham and houston)will get you started.  Also a basic accounting textbook(libby and libby)will help you get the hang of financial statements. Lastly, a book on valuation will tie everything together (business analysis and valuation by palepu, Healy, and bernard). 

Hope this helps, feel free to pm as well. "
2018-01-28 20:29:02,"Reinventing the wheel with a backtester: what purpose does this serve? Quantopian exists in python, xts/PerformanceAnalytics/quantstrat already exist in R, and they're just tools to let you implement your ideas, which you can implement in an excel spreadsheet (very painfully, albeit).

Blogs/websites: you really think someone's going to give away a good trading strategy completely for free on the internet? There is the occasional decent systematic trade written about on SeekingAlpha or whatnot, but even those systems depend on something like being able to trade mutual funds at the end of every month (not always possible), or at best, return 15% with a max drawdown of 17% or something. Far from spectacular, and far from anything that'll allow you to open up an asset management shop.

2019-04-16 15:22:52,"A lot of scammers in forex, indeed. Over at r/forex, we either are discussing scammers or calling out scammers among us. And plenty of shady stuff happening as well. [The flash crash in December last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-02/yen-surge-algos-set-off-flash-crash-moves-in-currency-market) was explained away by bots triggering trades during holidays, but r/forex was skeptical. With $3-5 trillion worth of transaction per day, a couple of banks/institutional investors can mess around with a few billions worth of insider trading.

That's why so much emphasis on risk management. I understand and agree that FX is not necessarily a reliable market. It's an open system, there is no regulation, and god knows how many shady transactions go unnoticed per day. But on the other hand:

1. That's why the insane leverage offered by brokers (although ESMA and other regulators are tightening those now). With proper Risk Management, you might lose small, but can win big. I can take a small position on 2:1 leverage, while my 500:1 leverage account assures me I can handle much wider swings in prices than for any other instrument.

2. In addition to that, as long as we are trading majors, almost zero spreads on ECN accounts, that are supposed to connect you directly to a liquidity provider. There is also no inherent ""bullish bias"" as in stocks: short-selling a currency is a legitimate and profitable approach. You also get paid for holding certain positions, through swaps alone.

3. The huge transaction volume is rather a plus in some ways, as it takes an insanely huge position and uncommon market conditions, to move prices out of whack. Before August, liquidity is abundant and regular TA holds well. Law of large numbers is better applicable to FX and volatility swings are usually confined around major news events or holidays. I am finding a simple MA strategy to hold well with FX trading, in backtest and real time.

It's entirely up to the individual, what they prefer. Some might like microeconomics, while others prefer macroeconomics. There is less degree of certainty with later, perhaps. Politics and mass hysteria can have a deeper impact than fundamentals. But I find that aspect of trading interesting too. I am still looking into analytical side for FX. ARIMA type models are present for FX trading too. But in future, I might try other instruments, once I get comfortable with them. If not spot FX, you can always go for regulated futures FX too. These days, [there are ETFs developed for FX too](https://www.thebalance.com/list-of-currency-etfs-and-etns-1215150), so plenty of ways to reduce risk in this volatile and massive market."

2019-04-16 12:58:28,"First of all, thanks for sharing. Code &amp; idea implementation sucks, but it might turn into a very interesting discussion! By admitting that your trade idea is far from being unique and brilliant, you make a super important step in learning. This forum needs more posts like that, and I encourage people to provide feedback!

Idea itself is decent, but your code does not implement it:

- You want to holds stocks that are going up, right? Well, imagine a stock above 100ma, 50ma, 20ma, but below 20ma and 10ma. It is just starting to turn down. According to your code, this stock is labeled as a 'rising stock', which is wrong. 

- SMAs are generally not cool. Not cool due to lag of 1/2 of MA period.

- Think of other ways to implement your idea of gauging ""going up stocks"". Try to define what is a ""stock that is going up"".

- Overbought/oversold part. This part is worse. You heard that ""RSI measures overbought/oversold"", so you plug it in. You have to define ""Overbought/oversold"" first, then check if RSI implements your __idea of overbought/oversold__ best, then include it.

- Since you did not define ""overbought / oversold"", and check whether RSI is good for it, you decided to throw a couple more indicators on top, just to be sure =) That is a bad idea. Mindlessly introducing more indicators does not improve your strategy, but it does greatly increase overfit.

- Labeling ""Sell / Neutral / Buy "" part. It is getting worse =)) How did you decide what thresholds to use for the labels? Why does ma_count and oscCount with a threshold of 0 is the best way to label? You are losing your initial idea! 
Just because 0 looks good, you decide that 0 is the best threshold. You have to do a research here. You'd be surprised by how counter intuitive the result might be, or how super unstable it might be=))

- Last but not least. Pls count the number of parameters. MAs, RSI, OSC, BBand + thresholds for RSI, OSC + Label thresholds ... I don't want to count, but I am sure it is well above 10 (maybe 15+?). Now even if you test at least 6-7 combinations of your parameters, your parameter space will be 10k+ of possible combinations. And that is just for a simple strategy.

- With 10k+ combinations on a daily data, I can overfit to a perfect straight line pnl. There is no way with so many degrees of freedom to tell if you overfit or not. Even on a 1min data!

The lesson is: idea first. Define it well. Then try to pick __minimal number__ of indicators (or functions) that implement it. Check for parameter space. If you have too many parameters, discard your idea, since you will not be able to tell if it is making/losing money because it has an edge or just purely by chance!

What is left out of this discussion: cross validation and picking best parameters going forward

* Hasn't trained enough (try tripling the training episodes/steps and lowering your learning rate - also use adam optimizer).
* Reward scheme is not good.
* The algorithm you chose DDPG is quite old (2015). By old I mean it has issues that were already solved in newer algorithms.

2019-04-16 09:10:50,"You already have a great foundation. Most who start trading or are even remotely interested in it, don't appreciate the value of statistics in finance, of all professions.

1. The book [Forecasting by Makridakis](https://www.amazon.com/Forecasting-Applications-Spyros-G-Makridakis/dp/0471532339) is specifically focussed towards students of business/finance. It is quick and easy to read, and reaches to the meat of the subject (ARIMA stuff) pretty quickly (you can skip or quickly read through the introductory chapters). You can pdf version on scribd.

2. I go with Forex, EURUSD specifically simply because: huge volume (trillions worth transaction per day), some specific parameters to follow (interest rate, central bank mandate, gdp, inflation, purchase manager indices), a comparatively easier intuitive assessment (you can get an idea of investor sentiments by looking at the economic indicators/central bank statements). Whether it should be spot FX or futures FX is something to decide: people might prefer futures because there is a central exchange, more transparency.

3. You can get all the data you need by getting a MT4 platform from your choice of broker. You don't need to pay for it, or even have a live account. Just open a demo account and you will have access to historical data.

4. MT4 is the most widely used platform. You can write programs for it too (Expert Advisors execute tick-by-tick operations; there are scripts and custom indicators too). The programming language is MQL4, which has a syntax very similar to C/C++, so it's easy to adapt to it.

Best of luck!"

That is why no brokers bother to offer you a deal where they won't sell or use your data."
2019-04-15 21:39:57,"higher frequency trading means the fees accumulate faster, so you definitely need to figure out which direction you want to go.

Additionally the operational side of making a scalper bot that works from a retail setting is quite cumbersome. Doesn't sound like you have the time or interest to learn about this aspect, so maybe look at higher time resolutions.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also a lot of developmental work that goes into the creation **and validation** of a good ""bot"" (I prefer trading algorithm), but you are already trading.. But I would always recommend learning to build your own algo. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know ninjatrader8 has a strategy wizard function where non-coders can build algos pretty easily. The easiest programming language would be Easylanguage (tradestation/multicharts). You need to survey your options, and if you're going to drop money on something do your research first.

2020-05-01 00:49:13,"Ok. I thought about this. Don't start a firm until you can beat the market yourself. Not with code. With effort. The biggest mistake - in my experience - is people code in their own biases.  This is a product of the Dunning Kruger Effect. People who are intelligent and well educated especially tend to over estimate their understanding in areas not in their field. So really amazing developers will start writing code before they have read a filing. Before they understand trader psychology. Before they've ever walked into an investment bank, or a boutique. I read dozens of papers on learning models every month but not one of them has a thesis they are testing. They just try to figure out a way to make money.

Well, everyone is doing the same thing. So what about YOU gives your method an advantage? I can make one trade a year, and beat the S&amp;P. Without code. With code, I can beat the S&amp;P everyday. But, I couldn't do the latter if I couldn't do the former first.

And, (I thought of this while typing) call bullshit on yourself every day. Don't believe something is working that isn't. You need to be able to prove it to the devil before you believe it. If you can't beat the S&amp;P in live trading, then you need to accept you should just by the SPY.

And... if you can't beat the market when the market changes. You haven't beaten the market. You've just ridden it.

I actually do this actively. I set up accounts solely to test things.  Whenever I have an idea, I create an account, throw money in and test in realtime. Drives my partners nuts."

2020-04-30 20:44:50,"Predictive models have a major flaw: markets are chaotic. So instead of trying to predict price moves, instead we can infer a dynamical system from the order book action (the state space of order books in exponentially dimensioned, think along the lines of trace determinant plane). Then we have a dynamical system that is local to the most current order book, and is implicitly controlled by a meta dynamic system, that takes it from orderbook at time t to time t+1 to t+2 to ...

By this method, we dont predict anything, instead we reconstruct the system based on local data, which is completely empirical and anti predictive. Then we can use the local system to give a trade, or just the state of the market (is it high or low energy? Etc).

The chaotic ness of markets is why it looks so random. Its chaotic enough that it is almost, but not quite, a random process."

There's some interesting work on this exact topic that other researchers have done, specifically the decoding of unconscious or 'pre-conscious' decision making.  There's a long way to go before higher level executive functions like reasoning and decision making can be used in an applied manner though. Once Neuralink or something akin to it (deep, intracortical wiring planted inside your brain) becomes a thing in 20+ years or so, then that opens a lot of possibilities in this domain.

For now, if you wanted to model stock prices based on  visual system activation when someone is looking at stock prices, we can definitely already do that easily, but that might be the most roundabout and superfluous use of ML ever imagined haha."

Also, I'm a bit suspicious as to the applicability of RSI to volatility. RSI might have correlation to historical volatility but has anyone shown it's correlated to IV? 

Pretty much what I'm saying here is that it's more than likely that an effective IVR threshold will actually function as an effective signal for IV contraction so there's your directional signal."

Pick up Howard Bandy's book on Mean Reversion to get an idea what a strategy looks like and consist of.

Write your first backtest and test few ideas you heard about. See how they all fail. Use specialized software to test your ideas. Writing your own, generally, will lead you down a rabbit hole. 

Keep looking for more ideas, keep becoming better at testing them. You want to spend more time on ideas, less time on coding them. 

Trade a bit meanwhile with a small size to learn about order types, executions, margin, commissions, slippage etc.

Getting co-located should not matter to this, the difference is simply the bid/ask spread plus any broker front-running that exists.  (On a side note, I think I could statistically prove that my broker is front running me or not by comparing my actual fills to the average bid/ask spread throughout the day).  If I were to move to limit orders then I would need to think about latency and co-location, which is part of why I started out using this timed market order approach."

What the algo does now is pull the candle 3 seconds before the end of the minute, and place a market order, which usually fills right on or close to the close of the bar with my latency.  There is no 1 minute lag, the algo just calls the candle 3 seconds early.  This can lead to some small differences vs the backtest but I can live with that."
2021-05-16 12:21:50,"One minute is an eternity in terms of latency.  If you want to increase your market order fill rate relative to your alpha signal consider moving your time frame to a more granular setting.  

You can still use 1 minute or 5 minute signals, but for order execution you can refine your entry signals down as granular to 1 tick.  

Just about every retail data feed can get the feed down to 1 tick.  You will still have retail latency, but st least you won't be in the dark for an entire minute while HF moves the price 5 to 10 ticks."

Build it all as one app, with different options on entry for different purposes. 

Also I would suggest sticking to one language for the whole thing, to reduce complexity and because you will end up refactoring things numerous times, combining some things, splitting up others, and it will be easier to solve things once for a number of problems common to your project.

If you try to to do a micro services approach as an individual with limited system engineering experience, you will end up creating what is called a “distributed monolith” which has all the complexity and few of the benefits . Micro services are better when you have many teams working on many services at many different speeds of dev and many different risk appetites. 

Also,  spin up the whole thing locally, and run tests against it end to end is invaluable. So start with the simplest approach possible, then when the simple ness is an issue, add only as much complexity necessary to address the issue. Adding complexity to a project is easy, removing complexity from a project is hard."

Do people sell them to companies, firms or people?
-Yes, all the time. Some go for $9.99 a month. Some are sold for millions and people have gone to jail for stealing code(Goldman vs. some dude)

do people backtest those strategies and manually trade with that strategy after they see positive feedback?
-A lot of work goes into it. Most researchers have Phds in maths or physics. Takes time and a lot of number crunching to find a working and scalable technology. Then you automate the process and test the fully developed system on a paper trading account. Humans are not reliable. Fully automated execution is important. 

do people backtest their algo and then let it trade on its own?
-Yes, some do. 


are you for or against making your own algo?
-For.

Are there special tools or requirements that you need that most people cant get ahold of? Ex: information, or technology

If so, please, I beg you, use an existing trading engine like Lean (i.e. QuantConnect), HummingBot, or similar. Study their source code too. Save yourself years of development work. If you were building a website, would you try to re-invent Rails, Django, or React?

On the other hand, if you're interested in building an engine for another reason, that's fun! A lot of what you and others have mentioned is very true. Stay away from micro-services for now. YAGNI and they will slow you down.

I'm more than a little confused by your distinction of micro-services and ""de-coupling"". Micro-services *are* decoupling, to the most extreme extent.

The database will of course be run as a separate process from your main app.

The rest of your ""services"" can just be confined in a single monolithic web server. REST/WS/LogicEngine/TradeExecuter etc .. they can just be one program. Once you study the source of existing engines, it will make more sense. Then once you realize what the limitations are, you can engage in more fancy architectures to scale out.

2. the crappy ones are sold on fiverr, made into youtube videos, and shilled to the masses...i've never heard of companies buying algos but it could land you a job at a fintech company.
3. up to the individual, some don't even backtest or have a shitty way of backtesting.
4. depends on the algo, if your strategy is a EMA crossover don't reinvent the wheel, same with grid bots, dca, etc.  If your strategy involves something unique you have to build it yourself.
5. not really, most information is already out there...getting proper data streams and cleaning them can be challenging in real time, some pay for good data. post processing data or doing ML on it in realtime can be GPU intensive which requires good hardware."

It's very much possible to take components like commission and slippage into account. 

It really helps if you have a coding-background, or willing to learn howto code. You could start with learning Pinescript and test via TradingView.

2012-06-21 20:12:02,"What exactly do you need low latency for?  If you're trying to compete against real HFT, there's no way you'll be able to outspend them.  A couple of issues you face:

   1) Your trading server will be exposed to the Internet.  This is one of the primary reasons why I would never do it via EC2.

   2) The cheapest EC2 instance is their micro-server which is $15/month.  Everything else is much more expensive.  I think EC2 runs a virtual machine, so you're not going to get guaranteed cycles like a real physical machine.

   3) I doubt the latency between CA-&gt;NY and VA-&gt;NY is significant for any purpose other than HFT, and like I said, even trying to do VA-&gt;NY for HFT is a huge waste of money because you will be smoked by all the co-located HFT shops.

   4) The biggest problem you have is that neither IB nor TD will give you real-time data, they consolidate their data.  This means that any attempts for low latency are useless.  IB consolidates I think maybe every 300 ms, and it misses a bunch of ticks in my experience.  If you want to get tick-by-tick real-time datafeed, the cheapest one is probably IQFeed, at minimum about $80/month.

You don't actually need a forecast of the future prices but instead an entry and an exit.

A cute experiment is building something that enters the market randomly, then will exit randomly.

Algorithmic Trading involves three key steps
1. Research where you build and test your strategy
2. Refinement where you control your portfolio and the strategies within
3. Implementation where you need to build something to place your trades automatically.

Some build their own indicators other follow published work/common things (I posted a fair bit of papers to get started).

It is used fairly widely, and it can be profitable, algorithmic trading gives the trader the ability to test ideas, even if people here don't come up with profitable ones at least this subreddit will teach them how to test an idea.

You can check for almost any type of rule you can write down and test it out, mostly algo trading is based on some filter or model to generate buy and sell signals. For some more info check the systemic investor site as he tends to have some interesting ideas.

2012-06-17 21:57:50,"Thanks, I""ll take a look into that paper on omega.  I'll admit that I'm more of a programmer than a mathematician, so a lot of the math might be over my head.

I do believe that my first strategy I mentioned had a lot of correlation to volatility, which decreased dramatically from 2008-2009 to 2012.  But even during the most volatile days in 2011, the strategy rarely worked as consistently as it did during 2008-2009, so I guess I basically missed the boat.  I might be able to tweak things though, I need to go through a backtest again, it's been a while since I dedicated a solid weekend to backtesting new strategies.

One thing I've been toying with is charting the PnL of the strategy, and once it reaches a certain limit, then suspend or end it.  I figure the PnL should trend just like a stock, so once the trend of the strategy breaks a certain limit, then maybe I'll ditch it."
2012-06-17 20:01:49,"First Principle:

If I put in a dollar do I get more than a dollar?

1. What is your rolling expected payout (i.e. return) for say the last 30 (may need to change this number depending on the frequency).

Second thing:

2.  Is there an explanatory factor for your losses, plot your average period return vs volatility, ATR, RSI etc etc, if you can find something that correlates with your losses you might be able to save it, (you will need a scoring function to decide the tradeoff between losses/wins).

3. My personal dump rules is when the win rate falls under 60% (on a rolling basis)

4. Look up omega http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2006/Schneeweis_Omega_as_a.pdf its essentially a ratio of expected return to max DD ( a bit more complex than that).

2016-02-14 13:08:30,"The question I suppose as /u/skgoa observes is that the timeframe is everything. 

There is a 'time-limit' for most mere mortals that hovers less around the second barrier and is more a of a 10th of a second or perhaps somewhat less. 

One major factor is one of communications, how rapidly can your communications system receive information to make decisions. 

So anything less than a couple of seconds and you are working with the strange landscape inhabited by the very high-frequency trading guys.

Their trading in a very real sense tends to break down into a couple of types.

1. Quantum - this really tends to define the 'lower' limit of time, and while not outside the bounds of the general algorithmic trader to see, typically the iron is physically close to the trading servers and so you get a quantum effect where the trades occur SO quickly that they basically have the buy and sell occurring before anything else could react to it. 

2. Intermarket trade balances, where multicasting trade commands mean that price variations that exist between pools mean that in addition to 'time' being unfixed, so too price becomes an increasingly foggy point because of the various delays and traffic flows. 

One solution to this is to simply intentionally go ""low and slow"", whereby you avoid or at least are less directly affected by trade variability.

So ""low"" in terms of how many shares are you trading (Nanex where share groupings can even  be fractional portions of shares) Things also get ugly when you start seeing rounding errors as [actionable in trading](http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/3519.html) - while questionable, the data clearly supports the notion that it occurs back in the stone age (ca 2006).
 
When you come up from the 'ethereal' world of the sub-second trading, things are still spooky but not nearly so bad and so a more traditional approach to time-series analysis or technical analysis becomes useful again.

The take away from the front-running/back-running guys that exist around and under the one second mark, is that volume will still screw you, larger than smaller volumes can be delayed or worse not serviced at all in some cases.

All of these points are things people work to mitigate. "
2016-02-14 12:35:20,"&gt; Trading decisions are made while the markets are closed

How's that work? You can't trade when markets are closed, so what do you do? Trade one minute before they close?

What kind of assets do you trade?  Stocks/Forex/Futures/Options?"
2016-02-14 12:31:50,"My system ""thinks"" once every second, but is limited to trading at the end of 5m bars since those are what my models are based on.  The ""thinking"" that is done every second is really just so I can have nice GUI output of what my models are thinking.  In practice, I don't let my models trade any more often than once every four hours though - and that's done to avoid trades that are highly correlated with each other."
2016-02-14 11:34:29,"you should just f1-f1 this, theyll give you the 5 minute answer, and if you contact your blp rep they can demo how to better replicate this with some training.  I've found some of blp's custom indicators actually not that bad (fear&amp;greed, trendstall, etc)"

2016-02-14 09:46:29,what program?
2016-02-14 09:30:41,"Let me translate your question into trading lingo: *What timeframe does your algo trade at?*

For me, the answer is mostly ""daily"". You get more noise and more randomness the lower you go. Daily tends to let me take nice clean trend swings. It also allows me to use free and ubiquitously available ""end of day"" data. Trading decisions are made while the markets are closed. Obviously this results in a certain amount of overnight risk, but in the long run it tends to not matter that much. As always, diversification is key. If the strategy requires it, I do go down to 1h and up to weekly, though. But I have found that going lower makes it just that much harder to be profitable. Lower than 1h pretty much destroys many profitable strategies. 

In the end, it depends on the strategies and assets you trade. No one can give you more than some inspiration. Backtesting will tell you what will work for you. "
2016-02-14 08:28:43,"Mine works daily (as the portfolio is possibly changed every market close)...

Ideally you'd probably run different 'thinks()' at different scales. Maybe your algo runs higher quality predictions an hour ahead (or a day, week, month, doesn't matter), and then pre-calculates actions that a faster algorithm executes on.

In the past I run my system on the open, and it would spend 10 minutes calculating what would be the optimal decision to make at each possible opening price (for held securities), then the actual trades could be executed in ~100ms by a different system which was fast enough for my needs."
2016-02-14 03:56:13,"Just a thought:

Have your every-second `think()` return a threshold value which is then stored in memory. Have your every-tick function simply compare against the threshold value. If the threshold is crossed, time to sell (call a `sell()` function)."
2016-02-13 23:37:56,"So event based checks (on new tick) vs time delayed loop (on second)?

Wouldn't that entirely depend on your strategy and what it's trying to capture/do?"
2016-02-13 17:39:09,"Probably, but my point is that we shouldn't rely upon risk metrics to be that precise.

They're not precise.  None of them perfectly capture the reality of possible future returns.

There are a TON of now bankrupt/closed funds in the world that placed too much confidence on their ability to accurately model risk.

Although a more precise risk model may be helpful for comparing system ""A"" to ""B"" and deciding which one to use."

2016-02-13 16:13:57,"&gt; This policy will apply to negative balances incurred during all market conditions, including exceptional market movements.

Would you have the same document in english? I can't find it."
2016-02-13 14:47:56,"A lot more.

Some investors care about the absolute return. Other investors care about drawdown severities and periods.

When I manage my own money, all I care about is absolute return. I can have a very long term view and I don't have to worry about the capital fleeing.

When I look at other portfolio managers, what I care about is whether the strategy is as advertised. "
2016-02-13 11:02:21,"If the distribution is predictable and consistent then that's a fine approach.  You can model the distribution and assign a p-value to any event.

Personally I don't see much benefit in an effort like that.  Modeling risk is not a precise science.  Future results will be unique and possibly different from anything we've seen in historical data.

So imo step 1 is using any of the discussed risk models or creating your own, then step 2 is to apply a generous margin of error to the result.  So don't waste a ton of time trying to get step 1 perfect."

2016-02-13 03:15:48,"Yeah but drawdown is just a single data point, which is fairly alarming for any supposed risk measure.

And it masks volatility.  Two models may have identical historical maximum drawdowns but one could be far more volatile than the other.

Its also dependent upon the order of events, which is good in some ways and bad in others.

I think you need them all to get any reasonably accurate representation of risk, because they all give insight about different things."

2016-02-12 10:28:42,"There simply is not ""perfect"" risk model.  Sharpe (based on SD), Sortino (based on downside SD), and Calmar (based on DDs) all offer some insights, but none are ideal.  They are either overly simplistic or rely upon false assumptions.

Personally I use a combination of the three mentioned above, plus some custom metrics that only really make sense for what I do, and then add a substantial margin of error to make sure I'm always positioned conservatively."
2016-02-12 10:09:30,"From my experience, sortino is an even worse ratio for the types of strategies I run because it only measures downside volatility, not upside. My sortino several digits lower than sharpe. "
2016-02-12 08:36:45,"One number is not going capture all the nuances of return distribution. What are you trying to achieve here?

It's much easier to create indicators that simply indicate to you when you should buy/sell an item then create a fully functioning system that actually does the trading for you. Also, you risk being banned for botting if you create a script that traded in RS for you.

In terms of creating an indicator for buying/selling items, I've seen a few other people do it also. OSBuddy allows you to download the GE's item prices through their API. Once you download these prices, you can manipulate them in excel (or any other platform) to create an indicator."

IB's Java API is well documented and pretty easy to implement.  I'd suggest it as a good starting point.  You're also going to have to get into position sizing and developing stop loss strategies.

This policy will apply to negative balances incurred during all market conditions, including exceptional market movements. Each client's master trading agreement will detail all of the specific exceptions to the Negative Balance Policy. If you tell me your country of residence, I can provide you with the documents appropriate to your location.

Some of the key exceptions to this policy include the following: negative balances incurred by legal entities, omnibus relationships, white label relationships, Eligible Contract Participants, Eligible Counterparties and/or Professional Clients (as defined in the client's master trading agreement) and/or negative balances incurred on share CFD positions or products traded on an exchange."

Hi Basjj,

My colleague Bryan specializes in API trading, but I am happy to address your question about negative balances.

The margin watcher feature on our platform can close out your trades automatically, if you run out of usable margin. FXCM UK and FXCM Australia offer our clients up to $50,000 in negative balance protection on their forex positions. For complete details, please review the master trading agreement which is part of the account application process.

Note that negative balance protection is not available to clients of FXCM US or any other US broker due to CFTC regulations which state that a broker may not in any way represent that it will guarantee against losses."

2016-01-31 20:37:24,"I'm going to assume that in your example of going up 8 pips before going down 8 pips your exit strategy on the losing side would be to sell if it did go down 8 pips before you saw your expected 8 pips, cutting your losses. That happens 47% of the time, 53% of the time you make an 8 pips gain.  

The geometric average of that is ( 1.008^53 * .992^47 )^(1/100), which comes out to 1.000448 or a 0.0448% gain on every trade. You'll need to be trading at least $40,000 to break even when you take into account $8 buy and sell broker fees. Also, in all likelihood, that 0.044% will disappear in real trading because you won't be able to actually be able to hit 8 pips exactly. If you can  improve that stop loss value to 4 pips this strategy would look really nice.

This is at least how I analyze my trading programs. I hope its helpful."

2016-01-31 14:30:18,"&gt; But I'm very unsure of how I should be going about managing trading frequency &amp; position sizes. 

If you believe your advantage is consistent, take every single signal your model throws at you but only one trade at a time and bet 2% of your capital on each loss. Say your model predicts 8 pips up before 8 pips down, then place a market order with an 8 pip take profit and an 8 pip stop so that if the stop is hit you lose 2% of your account.  That means each win is +2% and each loss is -2% and with your edge that means positive expectancy and thus profits and compounding of your equity for growth.  Monitor your drawdown, if it's too much for you, halve your bet to 1%.

If you're going to be running on multiple pairs, I'd limit total exposure at any one point to say 10% of equity.  So 5 2% trades at any one time or 10 1% trades.  It's always possible all stops will be hit so that limits your total worst expected scenario to 10% of equity.

"
2016-01-31 11:26:03,"What kind of development do you do? 

My suggestion would be that it's more important to understand the market than it is to be able to program. You need to have a working thesis (and the conviction to use it) before you have working code. A thesis proves or supports your edge. Your edge is proven (to you) through testing. The results give you conviction. None of this is possible without understanding how you will extract value, which starts within a developed view of how price, volume, time , and trend relate. IMHO, a ""basic knowledge"" of the market offers no particular edge when used in conjunction with another skill, like programming. 
So, in sum, where I would start is to read, read, read about the markets, trading, and systems -- read everything you can get your hands on so you can get to a particular point where then you can start building something programmatically. I have seen a LOT of (superb) developers spend an incredible amount of time writing tools to approach the market in ways that are not appreciably different from discretionary trading -- they were great programmers but really didn't understand what was lurking when creating signals to detect entries and exits."
2016-01-30 21:45:37,"So here's the basic setup with regards to  developing a trading strategy:

1. Make a hypothesis based on technical indicators, your intuition, market factors, what X fund is doing, etc. Obviously there is a lot to this but you gotta start somewhere.

2. Test the hypothesis using data. Lots of places to find historical price data for free, like yahoo or quantdl

3. Modify and upgrade the strategy based on the performance in step 2. Paper trade to get a sense of how's its performing in current market conditions.

4. Go live. To fully automate it you would have to use a traditional language like c to write something that trades based on the broker api. With your background you have a good setup for this. If you're happy with your results and seeing profit then that's basically the end goal.

I'm also new but I wanted to lay out these basic steps for you to know where to start. Basically there is a ton to learn and a lot going on but these 4 steps are the basic outline to making a strategy."

2016-01-28 15:41:23,".x% is usually .3% - 1% movements.  So a handful of pips usually.  Those setups are what my machine learning models found to be most predictable.  My better models can predict for example EUR.USD will go up 8 pips before it goes down 8 pips and be right 53% of the time it generates those signals.  These models were tested on out of sample data - completely separate (and not adjacent or interspersed chronologically) with the training data.  I'm pretty confident my methods were sound when making these models.  My concerns are about the best way to take advantage of this seemingly small advantage.  

I actually already have a trading engine up and running using Interactive Brokers API trading these models on my demo account as we speak.  But I'm very unsure of how I should be going about managing trading frequency &amp; position sizes.  I want a setup that can consistently make money (even if it is only a small amount) without big drawdowns.  

EDIT for a little more clarification:

I'm using 5m bar data for several currency pairs.  My models run at the end of each 5 minutes.  It's pretty common for my models to fire in one direction for many 5m bars in a row, but I'm not sure what the best way to handle that is....do I trade off the first one and wait some amount of time before letting my system trade again, do I let each 5m window trade a smaller amount (and subject myself to more fees), do I wait and see if the signal gets more confident in future bars?  There are a lot of possibilities.  I'm exploring them, but it's a slow process and I'm wondering if anybody has any experience or advice.  "

"
2016-01-25 17:53:31,"Yes, it would be a supervised classification problem.  Machine learning is good at combining signals or features to make a binary prediction (trade or don't trade).

First, you would engineer features for each consideration you make mentally.  This is the hard part, but it is made easier because you don't have to combine them yourself into a single signal.  Be generous, and include variations on each feature.  A good machine learning algorithm will be capable of ignoring the useless features, as long as there aren't too many.  I mean, don't include the return for 500 trailing days, each as a feature.  But do include various measures of momentum that you find reasonable.

Next, train a classifier such as regularized logistic regression, SVM, or a neural network.  Use 10-fold cross-validation when choosing hyper-parameters, and be sure to leave out some data entirely, so you can estimate the accuracy of your classifier.

Your training data is very unbalanced, which can cause trouble with classification algorithms.  The negatives greatly outnumber the positives, meaning you don't trade on most the charts you see.  To handle this, you could sample equal numbers to balance the data.  So, choose all the positive examples (situations where you DID trade), and an equal number of randomly chosen charts where you did not trade as negative examples.

If the resulting accuracy is low, it means either you aren't consistent with your trading, or that you haven't adequately described the important features for your model to learn from.  Or, it could mean that you haven't given the algorithm enough training examples."
2016-01-25 16:31:24,"Eh. I tried his FRAMA and it didn't pan out very well, ditto his trend vigor. Also, he hard codes the supersmoother and highpass filter settings as 10 and 60 IIRC, with little rhyme or reason.

2014-07-31 13:46:49,"Possibly.  But it seems to me that the trailing stop orders supported by broker platforms have the property that, once a buy (or sell) occurs, a new order has to be *manually* created and initialized (correct me if I'm wrong).  My question is whether or not I can automate this, so that once a buy (or sell) occurs, a new trailing stop order is *automatically* created and initialized, without any action by the user.  

Let me try to explain again:

Stock A is falling sharply, and I would like to buy 1 share of Stock A every time it falls $10.  Using traditional brokerage platform methods, I would have to manually set up a limit order, wait for it to be filled, then manually set up a new limit order, wait for it to be filled, and iterate until my 10 desired shares are procured.  This will require 10 manual order configurations on my part.  I am wondering if there are tools within my traditional broker platform to enable me to fully automate this process, so that I can click a button, go to sleep, and own all 10 of my desired shares by the time I wake up.  

It's also within the realm of possibilities that I'm in a little over my head, and am trying to explain situations that don't quite make sense in this context.  If it's clear that I'm misinterpreting/not cognizant of some fundamental concepts, let me know and I'll go back to the ole drawing board."

2014-07-30 17:22:36,"&gt; So you recommend starting with Java? And transition to C++? What is exactly the differences between the two?

So programming-wise, the difference between Java and C++ is that in Java, you don't have to worry about memory management and Java takes care of it for you whereas in C++, you do it yourself. Kind of like driving automatic vs. manual, it's easier to drive automatic gear but driving manual, you get the last bit of control and performance. You can read more here: (http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/pytfr/eli5_the_difference_between_c_and_java_in_terms/). 

In terms of trading, C++ is important for routing orders and passing messages since you want your quotes, orders and updates to your positions passed as quickly as possible to the trading servers; managing and executing the trades as they happen. However, typically, if you are an quant, you learn more Python, matlab, R for backtesting, forward-testing and coming up with the proposed strategies.

IB API is an API to a popular broker that a lot of people use. https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Fsoftware%2Fibapi.php You can try to program according to their API using their demo login, edemo/demouser. It's accessible to retail traders. 

FIX is a protocol standard that the brokerage industry use among themselves to make trades. It's most likely what you'll use if you are a programmer working for a HFT company. But it's not really that accessible nor applicable to layman. I

&gt; What do you think of NinjaTrader?

NinjaTrader I believe is a platform where you can program technical indicators and trade via these signals (e.g., technical breakout, breakdown). It's of no use to me as I don't trade on technical's. Programming-wise, C# is basically like Java. "

For example I have some space down at NY4 which is one of the major data center/financial hubs used by several exchanges.  The cost is about 400 bucks a month per U but that just gets you storage space, and you need to purchase a minimum number of Us and you also pay for power consumption.  You then need to pay for Internet which is about 1500 a month, and then either a cross connect directly to the exchanges which costs in the 30-40k a month, or you can consolidate them by going with a vendor like BTRadianz or Equinix or Atrium.

You also are gonna need multiple routers/switches which will cost upwards of 75-100k to handle their volume of data.

2014-07-29 13:15:12,"&gt; As in, would it essentially be those with a greater volatility will be penalized more with the covariance method &gt; due to not having that in the scaling calculation?

Yes.

You don't necessarily care about variance of returns in a trading system. As in -Swig- 's method would avoid securities with high variance. While the correlation method does not penalize for variance, it only penalizes for shared standardized covariance (correlation), which is what you want to avoid.

2014-07-29 12:40:53,"Swig- is targeting variance.

I'm targeting correlation, the two solutions will be different, as the diagonal in a covariance is unbounded while in a correlation it is 1. So the penalty for concentration is equal in a correlation matrix but it's not in a covariance matrix as the diagonal is equal to security variance.

The goal of the game is to try not go broke until you get rich. Sounds unintuitive, but the intuitive way to think about it is that every once awhile, even a monkey who just pulls on the handle on the slot machine is gonna hit a huge jackpot. 

The trick is you have to stay in the game and lost as much in the meantime to make sure that you have enough pennies on hand to still put in the slot machine and still come up ahead in the end. 

Formally, you can refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion

Speaking from strictly an options trading perspective, Victor Niederhoff and LTCM sold naked options puts and made steady gain in 80-90% on orders of billions and looked like geniuses and blew up because picking up dimes in front of steamroller (risking the whole principal for a high probability of making 15% or 20% on the principal). Bulk of Niederhoff's end of trade was Nassim Taleb. Nassim Taleb's fund lost steady money in the bull market of 1998-1999, 2002-2006, but made a killing in the crash of 2008 and 2001 where Niederhoff blew up.

I'd take a look into it if you're interested in learning more about the applications of covariance matrices.

A ""failed"" countertrend algo may be a huge hit on a different security, or with different risk/reward parameters, etc:.

The real question is, how much effort are you willing to put into an idea before the probability of finding success with it is smaller than the opportunity cost of not trying something new?

1. The nature of the market changed in March 2009 when the Fed began Q.E. I don't think calculations prior to that period are particularly applicable in this new era. 
2. Your call. Some people will say you have to use Monte Carlo to fully test your system, but the reality is that fat tail events are almost impossible to predict, and those are the things that will break your algo. I personally believe you can't do too much testing, but I also know that reality has a tendency to find things you didn't test for. This is just another way of saying, ""don't get cocky.""
3. All else being equal, your algo should function in the future as it has in the past. The whole point of doing this kind of trading is that it is supposed to reduce uncertainty. If your trade has an expectancy of 2.10 based on testing, and when you release it into the wild the expectancy plummets to 1.4, then your algo is the problem. Shut it down.

These are some of the more common ""technical indicators."" I wouldn't expect any of these to provide any reliable predictive power for the S&amp;P 500, at least not on their own.

Get creative. In addition to technical (price/volume OHLC bars) data for the S&amp;P 500, do you also have fundamental data?"

Get a good set of features and build selection algorithms. E. G. Bfe = Backward feature elimination. When ure done you have a predictive signal which is wrong 42% of the time. Still better than random :) "

Most indicators (basically charting tools) are fairly useless, I would stop at moving averages and RSI. What you want are statistical tools. Look into Ornstein Uhlenbeck process and different regression models that accounts for heteroskedasticity - weighted least squares, ARCH, GARCH, and so on. Check Quantopian.com community discussions and they also have very good resources to help people get started. One thing you should keep in mind is in this business, if you want to be remotely competent at it, should have some good background in linear algebra, statistics, and some level of creativity and resourcefulness. Let me give you a hint. A vol-target strategy that trades only SPX and TLT can beat the market. You can do this under 50 lines of code."

From a social/algo trading community standpoint 

The amount of time I wasted just trying to get the data in a backtesting engine (excluding USA) I feel like Brian is providing solution that will save hundreds of hours wasted repeating the same stuff with no real value added (everyone figuring out how to get a data api connected rather than innovating)

If you want to start somewhere re: fundamentals it’s the most overlooked / obvious metric but price and the profits/ earnings per share are highly correlated with price. It’s the rate of change of expectations or the second derivative that’s usually the most important (it’s bad but is it getting worse or better) rate of change of a growth rate.

Software Engineers 5 years to build.

Practically I think Quant rocket will be most suitable for virtually everyone (assuming live in the coming weeks) and you can plug any of those back testers in eg. comes with backtrader, zipline and moonshot (3 different backtesting engines) and trying to integrate your own custom data API with stock fundamentals and even derivatives.

Let’s just say I was very naïve/ underestimated how much work actually goes into some of this stuff for it to be institutional grade. And if you want to trade international markets off the shelf QR is the only thing that comes (will be) close to being feasible unless you got a few hundred grand in dev capex to spend and ongoing costs for programmers, data scientists.

Opportunity cost of time is a massive one to consider, no need to re invent the wheel, when you could be doing researching and building your strategy/gathering fum instead of doing something that is unlikely to add any value (home made backtrster vs off the shelf)

I think Java or C# would be fine because the benefits of C++ really only come about when you have people who know how to allocate and manage memory properly, which requires a TON of hands-on experience.  Not to mention the fact that it's extremely difficult to read code that's littered with pointers and other low-level functions.  And although I have faith that some people in this sub would be able to contribute to a project in C++, I don't think it would be very accessible to the rest of us (myself included).

2013-12-28 01:06:11,"Why is this formula important?

Personally, a stop loss should be configured to be at the highest possible level that the probability the future price path of the asset will end up after the expected horizon of the trade, lower than the stop loss AND with lower profit than at this point in time.

Given an expected future distribution of price paths you can compute some level that creates the best seperation between win/losses subject to the above constraints.

Data, indicators, buy/sell signals are all based on the same generic class, which has tremendous flexibility benefits. Then on top of that I have a kind of plugin system that allows various systems (filtering signals, order generation, position sizing, risk management, taxes, trading cost simulation, etc.) to modify what happens. The same system that does backtesting also does live trading.

2013-12-25 13:09:08,"You'll never get it right the first time, even after your 10th trading system, you'll always have to go back and make large changes in your class structure and architecture. That being said, there are some techniques to alleviate the pain of refactoring, such as [dependency injection](http://stackoverflow.com/a/140655/178073), automated unit/integration testing, and understanding the separation of concerns (aka the modularity) of each part of your code. For example, your market data processing code really shouldn't know anything about how you submit orders or handle positions, and if for some weird reason they do, those portions of the code should not make many assumptions on how they work. Design your code around useful abstractions, so swapping APIs becomes trivial and only requires new code beneath or near the abstraction.

These aren't specific principles only to developing trading software (of which is my expertise), but to any software anywhere."

2013-12-24 19:38:50,"Having worked on several professional trading systems, my advice would be to just code the bare minimum to get you going. There will always be something you haven't thought of that will require a major refactor at some point and that will be easier if you're only dealing with code you need, not what you thought you might require 6 months down the line, but never got used and is full of bugs. "
2013-12-19 13:39:19,"naw, i tried for a while, but couldnt really get it working, plus i sit infront of a bloomberg all day, and i only trade a couple of different types of options, so i just set up alerts to yell at me when they blow out or specific greeks i watch hit certain levels, then i just manually trade them.  "
2013-12-19 12:28:49,"True. But this would not account for unplanned events that lead to chaotic spreads. I suppose I could calculate the greeks and expected price with BS and compare it to the bid/ask and see if its in the same ballpark and if its not, ask for human intervention.

Not sure I would want an algo selling short vix after an announcement. It could very have well gone the other direction if the Fed decided to go full on taper.

Are you automating option spreads?"
2013-12-19 11:43:43,"you can of course program in data events where the algos ""turn themselves off""  for things like non-farms and FMOC events.  Basically what you see before these large events is a massive liquidity drain as everyone pulls their orders and then some wild market fluxuations as stops get triggered.  However of course, maybe this is the exact moment you want to capture.  had you sold short theta vol on the vix moments after the announcement when the spreads were superwide you would have crushed it (or gotten runover completely).  All things that need to be thought about ahead of time!"
2013-12-18 15:14:03,"My worry is there are too many variables for an algo to get correct. Take today for instance, after the Fed announcement my trade's P/L and delta's went bonkers. There were some pretty wild asking prices on puts very very far OTM. I would hate for an algo to be triggered on some blip like that. 

But on the other hand, I like the idea of having something watching the market when i am not."
2013-12-18 13:27:43,"yeah unless its a true market making algo, i haven't been able to crack the code of automated options trading either."
2013-12-18 10:14:16,Yeah - I don't use stops with options. I trade them frequently. But I'm really trying to figure out how hard it will be to make a trade in an algo. I often have to massage the price to get a decent fill

2013-12-06 18:43:43,"good point, as you'll need to model execution dynamics on the various parts of the spread.

You could model them individually, however the different contracts will have different bid-ask spreads which will be needed to taken into account.
"
2013-12-06 16:31:26,"Yeah definitely. I believe IB changed their cancellation pass through (not using them currently). Currently my brokerages swallow those charges, but don't have APIs.

I think its more complicated than crossing bid/ask as 80% of the time I am dealing with spreads. With naked contracts, I think you are right. 
With spreads, I generally can get a fill 0.10-0.15 below the mid (for a vertical for example)."

40~60 GB for 6 months doesn't sound bad at all. Once I get everything going I'll probably build a dedicated box and wanted to keep it small. But it sounds like a single hard drive should be plenty. Also, since most of these data feeds (IQFeed, ActiveTick, etc) let you download history anytime you want, I figure I can always free up space by just storing tick resolution for recent history and use larger bars further back if need be."
2013-12-03 21:45:40,"Well the data-type is tight, basically I have a record, that indicates, the actual time/date/machinetime/and node it was collected on. So I don't duplicate data from multiple machines, each machine has a set of stocks it's supposed to pull data from. 

I have right now about 4 machines I'm using to gather data, usually just some bare-bones leftover laptops that nobody wants, clean them up , throw a small hard-drive in, load Ubuntu and presto - acquisition box, divide up the list of stocks and go start collecting, at the moment, I'm collecting data in intervals of about 15-20 seconds at present . This yields a raw data catch of about 70mb per day per acquisition, or about 4 reads per minute.

I did an experiment and found that while it was possible to collect in faster increments, the volume of data was ridiculous , and I would really need an intermediate filter manager to select out stocks that had volume or were otherwise interesting, this would allow more fine levels of detail for statistical purposes.

I did another set of experiments tracking just a selected set of high-volume stocks and to be perfectly frank....there be dragons, I was collecting in 1/2 second to 1 second intervals, and the dynamics really changed statistically, you stop seeing trends per se and start seeing all these microscopic variations that are mentioned regarding HFT. 


Worse is that I had to put a bunch of controls into my statistical routines to make sure they were properly handling time-series variations, an early mistake I wrestled with and had fun going to school with - but it's an adventure I'll save you, was forgetting that while frequent, there could and would be gaps in the time-series from time to time, and you need to write your routines to handle that effectively. 

My recommendation was/is to get the rather intractable yet surprisingly helpful [Numerical Recipes in C / C++](http://www.nr.com/) , it's an absolutely great math resource, and has helped me tremendously but then again once I discovered [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/), I was a happier person. It's basically a Math Google that really can be helpful for certain problems, even just as a reference. 

So basically at the moment, 

I suppose I could look at after hours stuff, but just doing basic volume analysis (at least for NASDAQ and NYSE, appear to be from 9:45-3:45 or so, everyone in the pool,and everyone get out), volumes are stupid large, but A LOT of orders are either not translated or - as I suspect - either are cancelled or are not viewable at the resolution I am looking at the market.

Getting back to the data question, for me, the more machines, the more resolution, but this also increases the data-frequency, which increases the overall database size. 

More data is absolutely more interesting, but I think it largely depends on what you intend to do. If you are looking to trade over the span of hours, even as much data as I have is perhaps far too much.

All told, with my rather ""slow"" collection rate (about 1 update per stock every 20 seconds), for about 2500 stocks, I usually see about 1.5M records per day for each acquisition box.

This is then copied over to a database server box, that has a fairly simple structure, basically a few maintenance tables, and a HUGE history data-table.

This ""history"" data-table loads data in data into a few months worth of data, roughly 40-60Gb for about 6months worth of data.

I then tend to take the most ""recent/complete"" data and load that into a smaller fast-history table, which only stores one day's worth of data.

This is also most likely how I would approach handling a production environment having a historical server, pre-crunch the historical data so that any historical analysis needed has been done, and the trading server would have to do is fetch this data, reference pre-cooked historical stuff and make trading decisions.

More detailed, I suspect I would need to have two data posting processes, one posting to the historical database as it was coming in, and another posting data to a faster on the production / ""current"" box that would only have a few days worth of data , and a link out to the historical database for pulling previously calculated stats.

While this would keep the size and relatedness of database down in terms of size, it does still need to be a crazy fast box, in terms of what my day to day workstation is around the office."

2013-12-03 08:12:54,What broker/API are you using and how do you like it?
2013-12-03 08:07:33,"Yeah, I read Dark Pools. Very fun read! There are also a couple of documentary type videos about HFT that involve Haim Bodek, Nanex, etc. In case you haven't seen them, they're worth a watch:

* [Inside the Black Box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq1Ln1UCoEU)
* [The Wall Street Code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEAGdwHXfLQ)

As for ""pair trading"", I was referring to your #3 style. If you are interested in that type of thing, there's an extension of that strategy I've read about which involves using a portfolio of more than 2 related stocks and then weighting them so that together they produce a sideways mean-reverting set. It's an interesting concept, but since that strategy seems to be talked about a lot, my assumption is that all of the big players are already on it and will execute it far better than I could. For example, their reaction to news and such is probably far better/faster than I could muster. And I'm guessing that the most profitable pairs/sets are already saturated. So, I'm probably going to ignore this strategy, at least initially.

Your #1 strategy isn't really ""pair trading"" in my mind, but it is absolutely the domain of HFT. There's no chance for guys like us there IMO. Even amongst the HFT players, it seems like that's a tough arms race to be in.

I like your idea of pattern/behavior recognition and I've planned on looking into that further myself. There are definitely different characteristics to how certain stocks trade. Stocks that are hot seem to follow a bubble type pattern, stocks that are doing poorly often exhibit large pushes down but with occasional short squeezes once they go too far, and so on. But like you say, being able to recognize that is one thing. Turning it into a complete coded solid strategy is another.

I'm curious about the size of the data you're storing, as I have yet to start saving anything. How much data are you storing? And are you using your own file format or some type of database? Also, what resolution are you storing things in (Ticks, minutes, hours, days)?
"
2013-12-02 20:20:01,"Actually I started along the same lines. 

I have been doing a fair bit of reading on the subject in conjunction with my work. I was perfectly content with getting data at about 3-4 second intervals with at 15 minute feed delay from Yahoo or Google Finance. That said, I'm capturing a shit-ton of data every day.

I haven't solved a variety of problems that are strictly engineering/technical in nature, but these are no less important.

You mentioned pair trading and there are - if I'm not mistaken at least two kinds of pair trading that I'm aware of in slightly different contexts, but I'm mention what I've found out so far.

So a lot of algorithmic trading tends to fall into two or three categories.

1. A category of pair differential trading is where you have two markets ""A"" and ""B"" located 1000 miles apart, it could be New York and Chicago or London/Paris/Berlin or something similar. There is a HUGE component in trading around this category, where you have - say IBM or Apple trading at 50.00 in Chicago and trading at 50.05 in New York - vast amounts of money are being spent on systems that co-locate perceptrons or machines that scoop up the data on either end and then communicate to a central hub somewhere in the middle. 

	There is a very strong sense in the reading I've done that one of the major contributors to the flash-crash in 2010, and similar circumstances more recently, were caused by this kind of trading.

	The Options market folks also recommend you hedge these bets, so effectively the market is dominated by these high-speed orders.

	More damningly - and HUGELY important, is that the order commands to the markets themselves (be it Interactive Brokers or whomever), are themselves tailored, favoring heavily to professional brokers who instead of writing an order for ""Buy IBM at 50.05 in Chicago at 2:34 and not after 2:35pm"" put orders together that are Shakespearean sonets in comparison.

	A guy named Haim Bodek was apparently well on his way to making huge amounts of money in a trading operation like this. He was doing well, until the SEC and more particularly the guys actually running the high frequency trading marketplaces, (NASDAQ and NYSE) really started to favor, these more tailored and sophisticated trades and more or less ignore regular/simple forms of trading instructions.

	There is an absolutely must read book called [""Dark Pools""](http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Pools-Machine-Traders-Rigging/dp/0307887189/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=) by Scott Paterson, which is basically an expose of this shady practice, I found it fascinating in discussing the subject.

2. The next ""trick"" or kind of pair trading which really isn't a problem per se - is the notion of a ""private"" or dark pool. So we both get accounts with Interactive Brokers, if enough people do, eventually we will start trading our stocks in more or less the same time-frames as one another. In these cases, the entire execution of the trade might never actually leave IB's servers. 

3. A *third* kind is much more interesting, and more ""legitimate"" in that it involves finding two stocks which appear to have co-incident behavior and then finding whether it is effectively profitable to trade off between these two pairs of stocks. 

For myself, I've been kind of fascinated with some work I did with demographics analysis a few years ago, whereby we could identify patterns of behavior over time, and then project these behaviors onto new phenomenon. 

In my previous work there were a series of indicators (not unlike price and volume) and if you saw someone falling into particular patterns, you could tell - ok this looks like the ABCDEFGHI pattern, even if maybe the sequence has started along ABCD if you're doing it right you can have a set of probabilities so

- ABCDEFGXY = 5%
- ABCDEFGHI = 80%
- ABCDEF123 = 5%
- ABCDEJX22 = 5%
- ABCDEFF21 = 5%

You stand a good chance of falling into the 80% pattern. However I am unconvinced this is a ""complete"" strategy, because I don't really have any good handle on how to cover the risk associated with a bad trade 20% of the time.

My suspicion is however, that I will ultimately simply use the system to - as you have - identify the more liquid parts of the marketplace, and then do some sort of HUD / Alert system based on some likely behaviors."

I can tell you what my model is *not*. Most likely it will not be what everyone else is doing. Pair trading and ETF/Stock/Option mean-reversion arbitrage, etc. My thinking is that all of the common low-hanging-fruit are probably already implemented far more efficiently than my take on those things would be.

My goal, instead, is more likely to revolve around how I would go about trading things normally. And there's a very good chance I'll turn it into a hybrid human/algo trading system. For example, instead of having it search over all stocks and try to run a plan on the ""best"" one it finds, I may do manual searches and give it a list to watch over. And so on.

Just curious, do you have a system running? And if so, what is your strategy?"

2013-12-02 07:07:00,"I'm currently (slowly) working on coding up my own trading platform in a mix of C++ and C#.

Up until recently, I was using free end-of-day data from Stooq:

[http://stooq.com/db/h/](http://stooq.com/db/h/)

I recently subscribed to ActiveTick for data because it gives me relatively ""cheap"" real-time data. It seems OK in some respects, but I think you get what you pay for. I have yet to figure out how to handle splits and symbol changes (Happens often with OTC stocks) correctly with its historical data. My plan is to eventually switch to IQFeed once I get the rest of my system further along.

As for brokers, I'm currently with e-trade. I applied for the API, but it seems awful. I couldn't get any of their samples to run and their C++ sample seemed to rely on MFC. (What is this? The 90s?). My plan is to eventually switch to Interactive Brokers, since they seem to have much better API support as well as better trading costs.

So eventually my plan is IQFeed + Interactive Brokers, which I think is pretty common combo for single person operations.

Once we have a sequence of slopes the idea would be to look at how they change.   
Usually, the larger the set, the more it tells us about our sample space. Starting with the slope of our largest set first, we look at how that slope changes the smaller our set gets.

Anyway, despite it being the perfect platform for getting into the nitty gritty, he still elects to hand wave both entry and exit. It's sufficiently technical if you don't really operate in the domain, but what's the target audience here? There isn't enough information for regulators yet there is enough jargon to be confusing for those outside the domain. That smells of talking head.
   
&gt; 1.3.     HFT resting order at top-of-queue top-of-book 30.00 bid for 100 on Exchange A.  One method of achieving this superior queue position is through special order types combined with spamming.  Note that such spamming is designed to achieve queue position, not to impact the network or spoof pricing.

&gt; Cases 1 and 2 are clear HFT winners even though this example is for an impending sweep event.  Case 3 loses when the taker fee exceeds the maker rebate, but can be a winner if the flip out is done on an inverted “taker-maker” exchange, where the HFT is paid a taker rebate.  Case 4 is a clear winner if the sell at 30.00 executes, otherwise is a loser. In this simple example, it can be argued that losses due to cases 3 and 4 make the expected value of the round trip trade negative.  However, given 13 exchanges and approximately 50 dark pools, there are a significant number of exit permutations, special order types and exchange features that serve as alternatives to insurance cost (case 3) or execution risk (case 4).  Low latency, a prerequisite of successful HFT scalping, reduces the instances where the HFT is forced to trade on exchanges with less favorable economics in case 3 or into losing trades in case 4.

I'd like for there to be more transparency and discussion between both sides of the debate, but both appear to be more interested in swaying public opinion rather than in discussing concrete examples."

2013-11-15 20:04:13,"Sadly, it doesn't really exist. It really depends on what you're looking for. The best 101 I've seen is All About High-Frequency Trading. It's a little thin but stays pretty objective about the debate. At a minimum, I think it would give you enough lay of the land to know where to go next.

I don't think you could make and market a documentary on the topic without staying at a very high-level, so I never expect one to be made.

When it comes to Finance, when you hear about a topic, you need to stop and immediately think about incentives. Finance is literally about money. If someone is talking to you about it, why? This counts for everything from the broker trying to sell you on an investment to the people on TV talking about how soon the next crash is. How many people in the industry are spending all their time trying to tell you something that doesn't profit them?

On the ""HFT is stealing your retirement"" front is Haim Bodek, who just hand waves and spends a lot of time talking about himself. All the evidence you need is that he is a quant but insists on avoiding hard numbers and specs in every book and discussion. The only solid fact you glean is that he is unable to run a scalping firm because of HFT. Aren't we against scalpers?

On the ""HFT adds liquidity!!"" side is someone like Irene Aldridge, who, based on her two HFT books I've read, seems to have a very non-technical understanding of the industry, which is disconcerting at best, and an Ann Coulter ""burn everything to the ground rather than admit I'm wrong"" response to objective criticism when she is demonstrably wrong. See her comments in Amazon reviews for entertainment/frustration. Also, if she's in HFT, what is her incentive to publish a meaningful book on the topic?

Given that perspective, do some research on the author of whatever you read on the topic. You can definitely learn things from all of these people and places, but it helps to understand what would be glossed over."
2013-11-15 19:38:03,Could you perhaps recommend a non shit documentary / fact based documentary (or book?) on HFT?

2013-06-24 23:11:27,"Some points before we proceed further

1. Price and volume can be viewed as primary data, volatility is subjective in how you calculate it, over what sample period and what method you use (clean/uncleaned, anchored vs rolling window, smoothed vs unsmoothed)

2. To answer the direct question, the mathematical ""pure"" way would be where the slope approaches 0 as whatever trend was happening may change or inflect. 

3. Why would you build the system based off absolute price space vs relative price space? As this would breakdown in instruments where the absolute price changes fast (VXX)

4. Because I had an amazing dinner and in a nice mood, You need to also make sure whatever you're trying to trade off happens often enough such that you can gain statistical confidence (bootstrap CI) that your edge will come out in N trials and also that bankruptcy will not happen.

MSFT is $33.19 and INTC is $24.11 as of this moment, for a current spread ratio of 1.3766 ($33.19 / $24.11). So I would have the pair running, and it won't execute until the ratio goes down to 1.37 (either MSFT goes down or INTC goes up), after which it will execute the buy and short."

Despite that however, you make a very valid point. I've had another look at the Reddiquette and it does clearly state the following:

""Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, and it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.""

Firstly, I apologise if you feel I've been spammy. That was not the intention! Secondly, in the future I'll add posts from other sources (in a ratio befitting the Reddiquette!). But equally, I've always felt a bit unsure whether to post at all, given that the frequency of posts on this sub-Reddit is extremely low, which is why I've only put 5 articles on here in total (over 3 years!). 

How many posts do people expect to receive on the algo/quant sub-Reddits? Other quant link mashup sites will have multiple posts per day (e.g. thewholestreet.com) and they're nearly all very high quality.

hahah not to piss on the parade but i scanned a bunch of this literature and its mostly 2nd year undergraduate university material, maybe the most complex bits are covered in 3rd year courses.  you wont even get called back by a hedge fund for a front office ""quant trading"" role unless you have a graduate degree, often a masters degree is not even enough.

2013-05-27 02:33:50,"Hi guys!
Sorry, I was inaccurate. I only use WickedRenko (like BetterRenko, Renko with shadows) and never use Renko.
I've tried, as usually, Market Replay and the trades are right. Then I've tried with Live Data (no cash) for 1 month and now it's running with real money.
However, thanks for advices!"

2013-05-24 16:12:24,"Renko bars are notorious for giving overly optimistic backtesting results because they do not represent the high and low of a bar.  They are useful for visualizing only.  You need to atleast use ""BetterRenko"" for backtesting which includes the high and low.

Please read up on the downsides of using Renko bars because most likely all your results are bogus and wasted efforts.  Once you begin testing a Renko-based strategy in Walk-Forward real-time testing with a data feed your strategy will blow up.

Now I could be wrong, because most Renko strategies have a much more ""perfect"" equity curve than yours, but definitely be cautious.

-Commissions are not included because every broker has got his own; so every trader can calculate them more precisely
-In and out of sample data are used
-This is a backtest and not an optimization
-For this algo (KP) I used Renko bars: 2 series, to be more precise
-Sharpe ratio IS low
-2 ticks of slippage are included on every trade

This backtest results are part of a bigger job, that you can see on my new blog. I'm posting a lot of backtesting results and then I compare them. So I explain what are Sharpe Ratio, Draw Down,...

I try to find a blog or a web site that explains me these things but I didn't find it, so now I'm building a new one for who is looking for example of backtest results compared.

2012-12-13 12:07:14,"There are a two big problems in applying SVMs to predicting price movements:

* Prices are continuous, while SVMs were developed to predict discrete classes

* SVMs work best in situations where the classes are separable (100% accuracy is possible).  You would be lucky to predict prices even 1% better than chance.

You may want to look in to Gaussian Processes (GP) or Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA).  GP is essentially the kernel trick applied to least squares regression.  KLDA is a much more 'noise-aware' classifier better for situations where the classes aren't separable.

2012-12-10 15:42:57,"yes i understand, what i am trying to get at though is that avoiding overfitting by limiting perceptrons might be the wrong way to look at the problem. say you have to sets of data, x and y... the theory says you should usually keep the input units (x, x^2 etc) and perceptrons low to avoid overfitting? At least I believe this is it, but if so then i disagree, to me there are very few real life situations where these algorithms are applied that only have 1 factor involved ie: f(x) = y. so people designing NN should look for more variables like v,w and z ie: f(v,w,x,z) = y.

Abstract:  

Stock market behavior of individual investors is highly correlated with stock market behavior of their co-workers. For example, a ten percentage point increase in the fraction of co-workers that purchase stocks in a given month is associated with a two percentage point increase in the likelihood of individuals making a purchase. The high correlation exists even after taking controlling for individual socio-demographic characteristics and for time, stock, zip code, and plant fixed effects. Using data on family relations and on residential zip code, we show that the high correlation is not driven by peer effects at the family or zip code level. Moreover, workplace peer effects appear to be strong relative to geographical peer effects."

Maybe focusing on all ML instead of just NN would stimulate more conversation... anyways, I was simply agreeing with the final point in the paper, I dont necessarily believe that simplicity is always best. there are probable many different factors that should go into a trading model.

when you backtest you're looking for percentage returns. you can see if its profitable with just trading 1 lot of CL.  its very simple.  nothing here makes any sense at all.

2012-11-12 22:39:42,"&gt;In finance, the Beta (β) of a stock or portfolio is a number describing the correlated volatility of an asset in relation to the volatility of the benchmark that said asset is being compared to. This benchmark is generally the overall financial market and is often estimated via the use of representative indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 [Levinson, Mark . Guide to Financial Markets. London: The Economist (Profile Books). pp. 145–6 (2006). ISBN 1-86197-956-8.].

The indicators were stuff like if the NASDAQ just moved up in the last 50ms then we can expect the russell to move up as well.

Which market data vendor and broker did you use?"
2012-11-12 10:14:17,"Hey redditors - I'm the author of this. I never properly explained what I was doing for people that are familiar with trading. So let me try to correct that. First, it really was a HFT system. I had a server co-located next to the exchange and milliseconds were important.

Don't think of what I was doing as a strategy that predicted where the market would be in the next hour or even in the next 10 seconds. It's more like where it will be in the next 50 milliseconds or the next one second. (I only used 10 seconds to make sure I captured all predicted moves - and for some of my indicators this helped) Even with that what I was really doing was market making. Think market making and arbitrage. 90-95% of my trades were bids and offers. 90% of all orders sent were cancelled before being executed against."
2012-11-12 04:59:22,"I think you asked a really good question, why would it matter if the time frame is short?  I thought of two possible reasons, first in 2009 hft wasn't as mature as it is now.  That is not to say it wasn't wide spread but let's call it a modulation period and based on the p and l in this article the markets got more efficient which is why he saw his effectiveness decrease.  Second, in a risk on risk off or, roro, market we see a high cross asset correlation.  You mention that he is beta corrected, which seemed like saying the same thing twice as beta is a measure of correlation.  But in roro almost everything is correlated to the market more specifically assets tend to move in lock step with strong directionality.  Which brings me to my hypothesis, although the time frame is short, if the overall market has strong directional turns does it negate the time frame?  That is to say with roro we see less volatility, as measured as asset correlation, because assets move less on micro and more on macro.  Hopefully I was able to make those statements clearly its late and I'm tired.  But your question seemed intriguing to me and I was hoping to discuss it."
2012-11-12 04:38:00,"Right.  I got the exact same feeling reading this.  I mean I'm inclined to believe him but this in the title, machine learning, and he doesn't even talk about what technique he used for that.  It was all just 'curve fitting'."

Or they say they have a backtested system that beats the market and has massive gains then I look at their time frame and it starts in 2009.

Aren't these kind of biased because the markets pretty much bottomed out in 2009 and had a massive surge upwards. So anybody saying ""hey, I made it big since 2009 despite the recession"" or some sensational headline are only looking at the survivors and the winning strategies. For whatever reason people seem to start measuring from approximately the time the markets reached absolute bottoms too."

2017-08-22 16:06:29,"It is easier said than done... there are two ways to lower your spread cost: 

i) you end up on a B-Book broker where (with laymen terms) the broker is on the opposite side of your trades. In that case they will either kick you out immediately after a series of profitable days or you will start seeing one of a kind price swings that stops you out to erase your deposits. Basically, the appealingly low spreads would be your enemy...

ii) or you end up on an institutional fx feed with low spreads and good execution but that comes with a cost: you would need a fat deposit, high monthly volume targets, high infra/maintenance costs and some trading commissions depending on your business relations. 

Recently, some disruptive brokers emerged and these guys offer institutional level liquidity, colocation, historical data, API, etc., etc. with a retail price tag on it. I have been trading on one but last year i signed an IB (introducing broker) deal with them that's why i cannot spell a name here and broke the rules. All i can say is that, if you are serious with what you do we also do seed investments into sound models. So keep up the good work and drop me a line when you have 6 months of real trade history ; )

As far as actual quant work goes, I've seen much more variation. Unsurprisingly, most ML stuff happens in Python (really helpful to have familiarity w/ pandas, numpy, scikit, etc), but I see people using Matlab, R, etc. all the time when doing basic research. 

I should also note that the division of labor/team structures are vastly different depending on which firm you go to. Some places may want you working hand and hand with the devs if you're a quant, whereas others will segregate the two roles entirely. This structure will also shape what you're expected to be able to do, in terms of coding vs. quant skills, different languages, etc. "

2017-08-22 12:17:00,"**Production**

* *Most common*: c++, java.
* *Other options*: rust, go, erlang, scala, c#.

**Analytics**

* Python, R, Scala.

Many shops have more specialized skills/toolchains and use other languages.

Ultimately any competent dev will have familiarity with several of the above languages, although probably feel more at home with one of them. This baseline competence is such a basic requirement that in my opinion it is not the center of hiring decisions. 

Instead domain specific skills is what teams are looking for. These skills vary a lot across different flavors of algo trading (think from dumb-but-fast to slow-but-smart). Some of these skills are knowledge of the networking stack, state of the art concurrency/messaging/inter process communications, numerical linear algebra. There are several others.  "
2017-08-22 12:07:36,"It depends on the function.

Many data science initiatives and algo logic is done in Python. Its what I am using on CloudQuant. I have also seen R used in this field.

Many of the line handlers and exchange gateways are accomplished in C++.  

Some tools define the language you need. For example FlexTrade uses C/C++, Portware uses Java, Trading Technologies uses their own graphical interface. If you are coding in an algo firm that uses off the shelf Execution Management Systems you may need to use their preferred languange.

Almost all Execution management systems have some form of API. Those allow you to develop in most any language. 

My personal opinion is that anyone wanting to enter this field is to learn Python and C++."

But fx is a whole different beast. It's the Wild West of the investment world. Huge amounts of $ change hands every day, but with the same large market makers moving most of it. If you want to build a profitable fx algo you need to build your algo with the realization that an army of phd's with the sole purpose of taking money from you are on the banking side.

2017-08-22 10:37:19,"I did pairwise correlation between ETFs in the eurozone with correlations of 0.65 and above, so I don't think that is a problem.

My problem rather is in reconciling the fact that traders create correlation heatmaps for an entire period (e.g. finding correlation = 0.85 for Jan 2011 to Jan 2016), select pairs with the highest correlations, and then fit a Kalman filter which assumes a cointegration parameter that varies over time. Correlation is not cointegration, and the static view taken in the heatmap is incompatible with the dynamic view taken in the Kalman filter step.

And, related to your point on the lack of cointegration over time, I agree that these relationships don't hold very long. This is precisely how some traders justify the use of the Kalman filter which allows time variation."

You don't have a ""profitable Robot."" You had *potential*. Your goal, when seeing potential, is to try to break it. Try different time parameters, exit rules, different pairs, etc. SMALL changes in rules should lead to SMALL changes in profitability. It sounds like you've tried this, and broke it. So it's broken. That's a GOOD thing because it didn't cost you any real money. But get it into your head that when you see potential, your first instinct should be to try to break it. If you do, move on. That's what happened here. Sorry bud."

Namely that, if you're using a heatmap of static p-values (of the Engle-Granger cointegration test statistic for the entire period, I'm assuming) to narrow down your potential pairs, then how do you square this static view of cointegration with the dynamic view implied by using a Kalman filter?

Dynamic because in the filter, the cointegration parameter is assumed to be an unobserved state variable that follows a random walk and is thus *time-varying*."

2017-08-21 23:36:27,"Very profitable depending on how much effort you want to put into this. 

Start with an idea. Understand the driving forces described in classical investing books by Graham, Lynch, Greenblatt, ONeil or Fisher. For example, stock price follows earnings. A screener capturing companies with a positive earnings growth rate for the last 10 years, that are estimated to continue to grow in the next few years, that is trading at a multiple lower than the historical multiple to earnings, with decent fundamentals (start with a catch-all rule like ROE &gt; 10% or 15%) will filter out the ones that are losing money due to declining earnings. Sell at a fixed profit threshold or when starts to decline or slow down compared to the original rate. 

Another idea is to explore published white papers, like the ones from Fama and French on value, size and momentum, for example. Or the anomaly regarding high yield and low volatilty stocks. Or stocks from the Vice sector, since there will never be shortage of people that drinks, gamble and smoke. Start with an idea and once the entry and exit rules are clear, then you can automate it, that's the last piece of the puzzle. 

""As long as you are consistent in how you value business, your degree of inaccuracy, if it is replicated through consistency, will lead to a great model for relative valuations. So if your valuation model is not sophisticated, does not take into account six dozen variables, well, as long as you are applying it the same way to every company and you are looking at a lot of different companies, you will have a useful model for relative valuation which can lead to very superior investments return"". - Charlie Munger"

2017-08-21 22:27:09,"&gt; The binned price was also smoothed through locally weighted linear regression.

I've seen this 'smoothing' of data type of thing in a few bitcoin papers now, and I can't figure out why researchers think it is an acceptable thing to do. A fundamental aspect of the bitcoin markets is that they experience extreme volatility. The authors train and test their models on smoothed, less volatile, data, but then expect these same models to work on actual, much more volatile, pricing data. 

Doing this results in two possibilities when using your model in the actual market:

1. You run your model on actual pricing data in real time. This pricing data is fundamentally different than the smoothed data you trained your model on. In fact the authors admit that this is a problem saying: ""Without binning and smoothing, high frequency noise in bitcoin price would have overwhelmed derivative methods."" So this doesn't work.

2. You apply your same smoothing algorithm to the trading data in real time. But the 'smoothed' price is not the actual price of bitcoin. You can't just buy and sell at the 'smoothed' price. So this also doesn't work.

I only did a quick read through, so maybe I missed something. But I think this paper is a only neat academic exercise, and not useful for real trading.


Edit: And I don't mean to imply that you can't do any pre-processing of your pricing data, you can and maybe should. But it needs to be the appropriate type of pre-processing. In this paper, they took data pricing data that is naturally very volatile, and applied a process to it that destroys this volatility. I'm not at all convinced that this is an appropriate thing to do."
2017-08-21 22:15:07,The idea is that the cointegration parameter between a pair of asset prices follows a random walk - this is the unobserved state equation that is to be estimated recursively using the asset prices (from which we can derive the spread) as inputs.

2017-08-21 18:43:09,"Stocks are very complicated. When you make a bot, it's actually competing with other bots out there. There are certain strategies that work, and others which don't, and all of these vary regarding the timeframe and the market. It's like a very complicated game of rock paper scissors, especially when you are trading on this timeframe. Competitors are updating their bots as well. 

For example, there are certain bots with larger firms who will short or sell a massive amount of shares or currency to trigger stop losses of investors or bots. You have bots who parse news articles, and buy or sell based on certain words used. All these factors create a specific trading environment for each market. "

Well, if you flip a coin thousands of times you will eventually get ten heads in a row. Likewise, if you keep testing an algo on different currency pairs then eventually you will get lucky. 


&gt;I back tested it with average spread, and found out if i change the spread the results change, why?

The average spread changes the prices you can buy and sell at, so it should affect your results. In general you should not be back testing with a variable spread. The only useful backtests are those that actually buy at the ask and sell at the bid, as this is what happens in reality.

&gt; is this a good result to go live with the strategy?

2017-08-20 22:39:45,"That's the idea, and why one's portfolio should have different models focused at different elements like growth and income. When the market is depressed, value models do better. When the market is euphoric, momentum models do better. A combination of quality, value, momentum and growth should do well overtime. I personally code my models taking into account fundamentals (stock price follows earnings), technical analysis and market timing using economic indicators to reduce risk and switch to other asset-class types. Trading uncorrelated asset classes such as volatility and commodities also helps overall. 

Remember that no single model will always outperform all the time. It's the combination of models using different drivers, combined with discipline that algos provide that allows one to obtain superior long term results consistently.

Algos are profitable as long as the market conditions continue to meet the parameters set in the algo. Machine learning might be able to adapt to changing conditions.  Most likely you will be modifying the algo as time goes on.

I strategy I've heard of people using is running multiple instances of the algo with slight variations, so you can compare how the algo performs, and modify the active algo to provide the best profit/risk ratio that you are comfortable with."

2017-08-20 20:47:40,"Consider the following scenario:

One has an MC based solution to a problem, currently a result is being  obtained by performing one million samples.

This, lets say for simplicity, provides a value that is correct to three decimal places. If one wanted a result that was correct/acceptable to 4 decimal places, due to the convergence rate of  the MC process being sqrt(N), it would require one billion samples - or three orders of magnitude more samples.

From this simple example we can imply that the quality of a solution provided by a CPU to be in the ""one billion sample"" range, were as the  quality of the GPU based solution would be in the ""one million sample"" range, even though it performed the same number of samples as the CPU, it would incur a greater rate of errors. As a result the GPU based solution would be required to do another 2-3 orders of magnitude more samples than the CPU - in order to get a similar result.

As you noted the GPUs can massively parallelise the process, so from a time POV, it might not be as noticeable, but it will be rather obvious from a power consumption POV.

--------------------

NVidia and co, provide MC examples in their SDKs for things like BS et  al. But most of those examples are only single variable models, the really useful applications of MCs is in integrations of multi-variate functions and simulations of baskets (multi-variable scenarios), all of which require massive amounts of floating point computations, where each computation will contribute some error.

2015-02-04 09:37:47,"&gt;Because my moving averages are better historically at predicting crashes than rises, we don't need to taper beyond that point.

You sort of already cheated the backtest by fitting and measuring the same sample. But overall the philosophy behind the algo (changing bonds and stocks exposures) is pretty solid for a start at systematic investing. Of course eventually you'll want to add a whole bunch of other indicators, preferably some sentiment ones. 

&gt;Would using derivatives/slopes of my moving averages improve lag time? What I mean is waiting for the trends to show a leveling off instead of waiting for moving averages to cross. Would this also add more false positives?

IMO this is the wrong path to take next. 

&gt;Are my predictions (6 year Bull market, 1-2 year Bear market cycle) reasonable?

Reasonable but the market can/will always surprise us with its cycles. 

&gt;Am I tapering off at a reasonable speed given my predictions?

No matter how fast you taper interday it won't save you from a flash crash. 

&gt; What else haven't I considered that may screw me?

Your realized performance will be way worse than your backtest due to overfitting. 

&gt; Are there any good tools for back-testing algorithms over a longer history? Quantconnect doesn't really seem designed with long-term trading in mind (I really don't need minute data for 30 years of history, but I'm forced to load ridiculous amounts of data to look at long-term trends), and EZBacktest doesn't have enough features.

Right now I'm just using a 30-day and 365-day SMA line right now.  This isn't good for actual trading (6 month lag time, bleh), but it works well enough for testing purposes (only one false positive in 20 years).  I fully plan to brush up on my math and create a better detection system before I put this into practice.

I'm OK with some loss due to lag or trade times.  During a recession I fully expect to lose 10-15% of my capital.  I just don't want to lose 40%+ with the people who hold through the entire recession because it's ""too late to cash out."""
2015-02-03 20:40:14,"I'll start with assumption that your detection algorithm works as intended (because I have no way to check). Just from algo side, you are nesting a two antagonistic predicate checks within one another.

       if (detectMarketRise()) {
         //blah

I would separate those out:

    if (detectMarketCrash()) {
      // blah
    } else if (detectMarketRise()) {
      //blah
    }

Also, where you have the else if's for the expected loss checks for reallocating your money, make sure your bound checks includes the lower bounds.

Instead of

    else if (0.7 * expectedLoss &lt;  totalStockValue &lt; 0.9 * expectedLoss)

do

    else if (0.7 * expectedLoss &lt;= totalStockValue &lt; 0.9 * expectedLoss)


You may also assume that relocating a lot within a short period of time will not be as easy. You will have to include in your test some slippage. Going back and forth is another problem, if your detection algorithm is overly sensitive."

You definitely bring up some good points about issues with fraud and counterparty risk in bitcoin, it's something we're trying our best to help solve. Industry standard counterparty risk assessment guidelines is a great recommendation I'm going to start looking more into.

2015-02-03 15:32:48,"&gt; That's more of a market structure problem in my mind.

You want me to trade with you but you can't meet any reasonable standard for a counterparty, that's your problem regardless of the cause. 

And until you can meet industry standard counterparty risk assessment guidelines, no one sane should trade with you. 

For good reasons. Bitcoins are object lessons paved with fraud losses. There are reasons why we run real world finance in a certain way. "
2015-02-03 15:24:26,"That's more of a market structure problem in my mind. There's no clearing houses, SROs, and few regulatory bodies taking an active role in ensuring that bad actors stay away.

Until that happens, counterparty risk mitigation can only go so far. I believe a lot of that mitigation will come from bitcoin's inherent security features, such as multisig.

2015-01-28 14:08:44,"Flask is python, and you can call things from within.  As for charts, if you go the web route you'll have to get into javascript depending on how interactive you want the frontend to be.

I only mentioned Flask because you mentioned familiarity with python and needed a ui."
2015-01-28 12:59:37,"I do, but I find it's a give and take between exploration (+Excel) and customization (+any UI library).

To answer your question, I always found .NET WYSIWYG editors to be the best. I was never to pleased with Python options. There's probably some equivalent in Java but I haven't written a UI in Java in over a decade."
2015-01-28 12:05:17,"so, flask to python to say ibpy or something like that?  i'm guessing it's easy to publish a chart on flask as a widget and move it around etc?  "
2015-01-28 12:04:02,"yeah, i find excel a little limiting.  don't you?  have you ever used another language to build a robust interface and algo?"
2015-01-28 11:52:44,"I mean, why not use Excel as the UI? Or is there something in your UI plans that you cannot achieve? I usually whip up a quick Excel mock-up that often ends up being the final front-end. Or do you mean graphics/charts/market data that you want to represent more flexibly than Excel would allow?"
2015-01-28 11:48:41,"If you just want to push buttons and make something happen, you can run Flask.  It's a python framework for websites.  If you're running it locally, Flask will launch a little webserver for you so you don't have to worry about that."

2015-01-26 17:30:15,"The guy that gave you the 8 bullet points has tried to be helpful but in my opinion he's getting it wrong. there's no point in doing the 7 other points if you cannot invent a strategy which works. The actual mechanics of executing the orders and receiving signals from IB (or whoever) is a 'definitely achievable' objective. Necessary but not what would be termed a ""project risk""

Project risks are things that can stop the project from being a success. Failing to invent a profitable strategy is 10/10 on that scale. So you should consider it your top priority. 

Implementing mechanics can come later. If you're a recent graduate and trying this as a project in place of a job and starting a career then I would say you're making a mistake and you should get some years of experience in a commercial environment under your belt before trying something like this. Or do this as a sideline with working and earning money and building a professional reputations/experience.

I've got nearly 20 years professional programming experience and my wife is a statistician and I have spent the best part of 2 years FULL time trying to get something that I would consider 'good' and I'm still not there yet. 

Dont put all your eggs in one basket. especially one as fraught with challenges as this business. Its not easy. In fact there are plenty of quant houses and hedge funds that have gone bust on this quest. 

If you want a couple of pointers, I'd say Take a look at the ""Weka"" machine learning toolkit. Also read this book. http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

It depends what you're trying to achieve with your trading strategy. I'm trying to make something that auto-trades 50-100 stocks simultaneously. I want diversification and high returns with good certainty. A tall order and a difficult combination.

www.nuclearphynance.com is interesting as well.

But really I dont think this should be your priority as a recent grad. I would strongly recommend getting a career started and avoid having a gap on your CV.

2015-08-16 17:46:37,I enjoy coding strategies in NinjaScript/C#.  MQ4 makes me cringe.
2015-08-16 14:47:51,"You can do both. In MQ4 there is a process were you can import DLLs and call functions on them. Here is an example from something I did a while ago;

    #import ""C:\path.to.the.dll""
       int connectTo(string hostname, int port);
       string sendTo(string what);
       int closeDown();
    #import"
2015-08-16 13:05:36,"I know it's based on c or c++, so depending on why you are looking to learn c++ it might be good to go straight to mq4. If it's based on c, that still helps pick up concepts and shows you what shortcomings c++ fixed. 

If you are looking at c++ for reasons other than trading, mt4 might not teach you as wide a range of things as other projects.

You also won't learn a ton about the compilation step if you go to mq4. It depends on why you're learning and what you're hoping to pick up. Mt4 is great for learning algo trading in general.

Edit: reread the original. Mt4 will be more restricting than setting up your own trading platform and such. I'd say it is great for learning the interface between programming and trading. Then a step up is building the whole platform yourself. Mt4 has built in functions for all the signals you could want, variables keeping track of the price for you, and is easy to backtest. That's a lot of work you would later need to replicate on your own, and going straight for that is tricky without the mq4 stepping stone imo. "

2015-08-15 14:15:29,"Check out [SQLite CEROD](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/cerod.html). The way I know it was implemented at a small prop shop is that for every asset class, they would have a separate SQLite database/file for that day's tick data. Obviously minute data you can roll up into monthly databases/yearly depending on how many symbols you're tracking. Then you can just write a small layer on top of it that will distribute date ranged queries over all the files and aggregate them. Since it's compressed/read-only historical data, you'll have no problem with multi-threaded reads."

For the actual implementation, mmap based appended records are usually always at the core of the system, whether it's kdb, chronicle, or your home rolled. People do use software like VoltDB and I have even seen an implementation built on top of compressed SQLite in-memory and persistent databases chained together.

Since I recall you using Java, just use Chronicle's products. They are all open source, off heap (mmap), 0-garbage, and even distributed.  http://chronicle.software

For mmap'd storage, you can write an indexing layer on the files, or use binary search after you sort them. Many shops also offload querying to a traditional data warehouse like Oracle, SQL server, etc where batch loads are done on set schedules.

The key to online queries on real time data is just keeping it all in memory and designing cache friendly access patterns. So that means lots of memory and cache friendly data structures."

Broker respond with a ExecutionReport status New/Rejected. Then once you get a partial / fully - filled they will send you another ExecutionReport stating so (unsolicited).

Thus the only msg where you can send in clearing instructions to the broker (who will forward it on the trade to the clearer / might be them self) is in the NewOrderSingle. There are many different tags for this however it is not likely that you will be successful in persuading the broker to modify their fix engine to your needs.

I see your point, I respect it. Let me explain:

I am simply studying on a draft-feasibility as an entrepreneur. I can not build the towers nor pay for a professional feasibility. The thing is, you civilized people of the 1st world are already familiar with the low latency networks. But here in the 3rd world you can not find professional advisers and such. So, I personally need to come up with some ROUGH definition of the mw towers so that I can sort out a rough cost/per tower (construction only). That is the easy part, main problem is to value the latency advantage (eg. potential with latency arbitrage, revenue potential when leasing the line to brokers, etc.). "

To do research and prototyping, NodeJS is pretty awesome.
There are tons of libs available on NPM, you can build interfaces easily using HTML/CSS, and NodeJS can run C, C++, Python and other languages, so you don't get too limited.

I built a custom research platform in NodeJS, complete with a backtester.
My plateform includes various AI implementations, Genetic Algorithms, statistical analysis, sentiment analysis, news and twitter monitoring, signal generation, pattern clustering and forecasting, and a ton of other things (I'm doing research on it for 10 months now)

The only weak point of NodeJS is charting and I fixed that by building my own technical charting lib: https://github.com/26medias/techChart (I'll update to the latest version this week). it's exporting huge charts up to 50K pixels wide in just a few seconds, in PNG (so super lightweight)

R is made for big data and statistics.  It is put together to make the manipulation of data and graphics very easy.  It also has some ability  with computational math.  R's utility ends at data analysis however.

Python is much more broad and versatile.  It has a huge range of libraries which allow someone to do mostly anything well. That said, it probably isn't as good as R at stats, but it makes up for this by being generally good at everything.  Python is also much easier to program in.  It tends to be the language I see people recommend to someone who wants to start programming because of how friendly and broadly useful it is."

2015-08-03 13:27:51,There is an optimizer which is held in the risk control function that all orders pass through and are checked then passed on to be executed. at this stage you can check the current portfolio and see what its holding and if you are in within parameters.

what i mean is the process is the same is that the evaluation loop of signals is the same. turning signals into orders into trades into positions into portfolios.

the signal generator function is going to be different for every model and will be called for every tick/event

R seems to be what is used if you have longer term strategies which don't require fast computing, or for backtesting strategies for implementation in C++.  C++ is used for high frequency strategies.

Since you are teaching yourself, I would say learn R, and then pick up the C++ you need if you need something fast.  R is a lot more easy to work with, has a big community and all the libraries you could possibly want.  There is even a community for R traders.


I also hear about Python being used. One of my friends studies data mining and machine learning and he loves Python.

In conclusion:  I guess I would say concentrate on R or look into Python unless you want to do something super-fast.

* If you want to import ""End of Day"" data for free, you can find data via Yahoo Finance, or other services. Typically this data comes in .csv format, and you'll write a parser to deal with it.

* If you want free real-time data, it will be of dubious quality. While you could scrape web pages and such, typically all of the free data is time delayed, usually by 15 minutes. That's too old to be really useful. However, some brokers (ex. Interactive Brokers) offer an API with real-time data. You probably won't get quality tick-data for free. But if all you need is real-time minute/hour bars, then your broker might be all you need.

* If you want real-time tick data, you'll need to pay for it. The most popular vendor is IQFeed. There are other options out there. But basically all of them will have some API that you use to stream in the data."

2015-07-30 23:18:11,"Here are just my kind of birds eye view of what a back tester / research platform should have. 

* The language you use should be fast for prototyping. You mentioned this is not for algo trading but only for research. So R, Python, Matlab will probably suit you best. They are all solid, I have used all 3 before. Some excel in some areas more others. But if your fund is going to pay i would say Matlab with the trader and econometric packages would do very well. Between R and Python, for your needs I would lean more towards R as there are a lot of good financial packages and a more robust community. Python is good if you are integrating with a lot more systems, numpy is great but it's financial packages/community are not as developed. So you will be home rolling a majority of the functions you need which will take time away from the actual research. 

* I am assuming if you are doing value trading its going to be more long term stuff. So you can just use any of these and save your data / fundamentals to flat files (.csv) and load them up. No need to build up a data base structure. 

* You need to have some essentials that are reusable, an accounting blotter, a data handler, indicator and signal calcs that don't have look ahead (can be vectorized or event driven depending on fast vs accurate trade off) , portfolio objects, and some performance analysis functions.

* on vectorized vs event driven. You can do preliminary tests in a vectorized form just to see if it works out alright and get some fast results. Then change the data handler / signal calcs to getNewBar and go event driven when you are more confident in your idea. This cuts down on computing time of ideas that would end up in the garbage anyway.

* I suggest modeling orders not trades. This gives you more flexibility and can make simulation results more realistic. Orders become Trades become Positions placed into portfolios.

2016-09-05 14:21:09,Not exactly sure how to apply this algorithm.
2016-09-05 12:23:41,"What I do is calculate an exponential average of the High - Low for each bar over the last 20 bars which I mainly use only a daily time frame. My variable is more like an ETR except I calculate it slightly differently than an ATR because I have a different opinion on how to calculate ""average true range""

Nonetheless the scripts when plotted follow a similar path, albeit along different values since mine is, like I said, more sensitive (matter of opinion). 

The problem with a fixed value such as ""10 hours ago"" is first that you didn't say what time frame you are trading on. 1M, 5M ,30M...? Based on your time frame your ""benchmark"" value will differ on difference time frames. 

Secondly you have to justify 10 hours ago vs 15 or 20 or even 1 hour ago. What's the significance of 10 hours ago? To me it's a very arbitrary point. 

What you need to consider is past volatility in it's entirety say over the last *""X""* amount of bars. 
For example if I calculate ETR (my way) for a stock such as $MU I'll see that the best times to buy is when ETR falls below .45. The problem is sometimes it falls way below .45 and other times it doesn't go all the way back down to that level before making another big move. 

Since it only calculates volatility without thought to price direction it's possible that the ""big move"" you expect to go upward may in fact move against you. 

Lastly, you could only use a ""benchmark"" for a single stock. You can't say, ""I'll buy *any* stock when it goes above or below *""X""* ETR/ATR"".  You simply have to consider each stocks volatility ""profile/behavior"" and base your script or ""benchmark"" of that. "

2016-09-05 05:27:44,"Right, but how would you know when to enter? That fluctuating value has to be compared to some benchmark so that we know volatility is high enough to suggest an oncoming trend. That ""benchmark"" can be a fixed variable that we code in, or it can be something like I had in the OP (albeit with ETR instead of ATR) where the current volatility is compared to past (10 hour ago) volatility.

2016-09-05 00:04:03,"In my experience a regular average distributes equal weight to all values where as an exponential average give more weight to most recent values making it slightly more sensitive or likely to accurately represent current conditions.

https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr150.html

and dual momentum paper that opened my eyes to different kinds of methods on equity side:

2016-08-30 14:58:58,"I'm not sure how much CS experience you have, but I went from little to no CS experience in the Summer of 2015 to just now paper trading my first intraday strategy. I started by watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxjIOXstxCk&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeN06s5ervxTfTcVvt-xpZN), copying down every line of his code till I understood the logic and could experiment in Quantopian. From there, I started watching the Quantopian lecture series to better understand what I was dealing with (would definitely recommend). And once I had a decent grasp of trading and Python, I learned pandas and moved off of Quantopian. Learning not to use Quantopian was probably one of the best things I could've done to progress my abilities, since I was forced to perform the analysis, backtesting, and development necessary to create an algorithm by myself. It definitely wasn't the path of least resistance, but I'm glad that I went that way regardless. The key is to keep dreaming up strategies that test your CS ability and working towards materializing that strategy.

Oh yeah, unless you have a background in both trading and CS, it will likely take you a *long* time to get somewhere with algotrading. I had some prior experience with trading, but I've been dedicating anywhere between 15 - 25 hours a week on learning/coding over the past year. Fortunately, I'm young and don't have a full time job, so it might take longer for someone who has a full time job to develop a proficiency."

I'm so green I don't even know what it is I need.

tbh, the side bar is really unhelpful with this. Just one of the links says you need to read like 2 dozen books. And among those 2 dozen, a number of them are graduate level math and CS books. I'm sure reading them all would be helpful but I doubt thats really the minimum to get started."

I'm more of a trader than programmer, but whenever I read algo threads I often think to myself how great they are at programming but how little they sometimes think about the actual trading strategy. 

Imo everything you need is available online for FREE, you just have to be willing to put in the work. At least on the trading side. Of course if you have to learn programming, a structured (online) class might actually be a good idea...even if you could probably learn that for free as well."

Why am I doing it? First of all it's a healthy hobby plus gaining skills in the world most attractive field: data mining and machine learning. Moreover, if me and my algorthim where able to sustain yearly returns above the inflation, I could build a large capital from Investors.

2017-03-12 18:16:11,"Without having used neither `Quantopian` (or `zipline`) nor `QuantConnect` there are choices when implementing the backtesters that affect the results.

**Example**: an algorithm executed with daily bars

  - There is something which should be obvious but apparently most people choose to ignore when backtesting: the bar being evaluated is already **closed**. I.e.: you have the 4 price points (`open`, `high`, `low`, `close`) because the 4 points will not change.

  - Many indicators rely on the *closing* price for calculations (de-facto standard for moving averages and included for example in the calculation of the `Stochastic`)

The question:

  - when you issue a (for example of `Market`type) an order ... should it be executed against the known prices of a **closed** bar or using the next incoming price? (that price would be the `open` from the next bar)

Some platforms choose to let you execute on the bar under evaluation. Some platforms only let you get the next incoming price. Some others will let you flip a switch to let you decide

An example: `backtrader` (disclaimer: author) has a default offering execution with the next incoming price. But you can activate the `cheat-on-close` mode in the broker to execute on the same bar.

Some other differences:  **Not all indicators are implemented equal**

As a simple example some platforms offer an `RSI` which uses a standard `Exponential Moving Average` instead of the `Smoothed Moving Average` (or `Modified Moving Average`) used by Wilder in his book. The latter has also an exponential character, but it's not the same. And that difference can be the source of different signals.

**Summary**: you need to know the rules of the house."

2017-03-09 05:10:15,"So instead of scattered questions, you should have a defined attack plan:

- Write down the actual strategy with the prediction, with the exit conditions.

- Backtest the strategy, calculate returns, sharpe ratio and max downdraw. Return must be positive, max dd shouldn't leave you bankrupt or crazy, if this is your only strategy sharpe ratio should be at least 2.

- Make sure that you backtest also on virgin data, data that you didn't use to develop the strategy. This validates against overfitting.

Just try to answer this question to yourself: if I simply predict that the SPY price is going to increase tomorrow, I'll probably have a pretty good accuracy when backtesting in the past few months or so. Why is your strategy any better?

There's a few plataforms online that have embedded backtesters, you can try to start there. "

Unfortunately I don't have the code for them but I'm trying to recreate them myself. So I'll be able to make trades with them once I figure out this last one on the bottom.

The moving averages seem easy enough. I'm trying three EMAs at 5, 12, and 32 right now and that seems close.

The first indicator below the chart looks like some kind of trend follower / histogram ([similar to the one on the MACD](http://d1298eg8eju4xv.cloudfront.net/image/4fd8ae36572b94b20b000036/original/MACD%20-%20Relation%20between%20lines%20and%20histogram.png?v=607933787)).

2017-03-09 01:25:51,"you should test on different time periods, not different pairs on the same time period.

this is because all the pairs are heavily correlated in the same time period.

to make it worse both pairs have USD in common. when USD moves, both pairs will move together. you have heavily overfitted to USD.

Your response helps to differentiate between a post-hoc exercise (proving that had one allocated assets between the two indices in such-and-such a fashion the diversification would have improved returns) vs a forward-looking algo which uses the training period to parameterise a hypothesis and then tests it using the testing period.

"
2018-10-08 02:31:06,"I sort of mind. Not really, it is just irrelevant. After school i became a stock and futures broker, then did trade on and off my own accounts (back then algo trading did not exist really) and then moved into programming as a trade. Combination of those - natural - there you go. These days my ""day"" income is a smallish IT Consultancy (which gives me quite good money), 95is% of my income last year was trading and risk investments.

You can start with very small accounts (1000USD, 10000 USD). Seriously whatrever ability you can demonstrate will put you above everyone else on the pile. Just be carefull you are still employable. Math is useless without basic trading knolwedge (what is a limit order?) and running your own alogos does demonstrate at least a solid understanding of the fundamentals. And if you have a real talent, then youmay consider a career in trading yourself - I know quite a lot of traders that make algos and manage their own and some customer funds. IF (which I consider more likely than not) we get a financial crisis the next years, you may find yourself on the wrong end of employment otherwise. If anything, besides a major running your own account will definitely help you demonstrate you understand the basics.

And remember most brokers offer non cash simulated accounts. There is NO Reason to not use those first to validate your algo actually does what you plan it to do ;)"

2018-10-07 23:36:20,"Scott Meyers made [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996) which has a lot of changes in the language documented and documented well.  If you're proficient in C++ I highly recommend checking it out.  (Or watch: https://youtu.be/xnqTKD8uD64)

The big one is ownership semantics leading to smart pointers.

The general rule of thumb is you should never use a raw pointer, except when you're not transferring ownership.  Also, consider `weak_ptr`, and references, always references.

SFINAE in class, really?  I'm impressed.  Use `constexpr if` instead when you can (90% of the time).  SFINAE should really only be used for firmware and library engineers and is on its way out, if concepts ever get finished.

Metaprogramming in C++?  More like dark magic, taking advantage of C++17 plus SFINAE.  No, I think you mean meta template programming, most likely.  Meta template programming has been replaced with `constexpr if` as well.  Don't do it, unless you like pranking your coworkers.  You can write meta template programming to crashes IDEs when they try to read the file.

&gt;data structure/algorithms (arrays/linked lists/trees/maps/stacks/queues/searching/sorting/graph searches and efficiency considerations)

That's more data structures than algorithms.  I personally think algorithms are more important, but I digress:

`std::deque` is important, and no it's not a doubly linked-list.  All the different hash and tree structures like `std::unordered_multiset` are super helpful to know, even if you never use them.  Understanding sets and tuples too.  None of this is specifically modern C++, except that most of these data types didn't exist or were incomplete 'till C++11.  cppreference is super helpful and imho should be used regularly.

Oh and C++ has a whole slew of algorithm functions and classes now.  Check them out on cppreference, but imho they're not super helpful like they are in Python or R.  Really, learning how to make an algorithm is more important.

Oh, I've been rambling about old stuff.  Okay back to modern: the different kinds of bracket initializations are important.  Previously initialization had a lot of () in it, so `auto foo = Bar(0);`, should that be a () or a {}?  Looking at it I can tell you it most likely should be `auto foo = Bar{0};` but it's not a guarantee.  I'd have to look at Bar's source code to verify.

There are modern idioms that should be considered, like aaa or almost always auto, and should be followed when possible and reasonable to do so.

Lets see, what else.. `nullptr` instead of NULL.  A lot of the pre processor can be replaced with `constexpr` and `constexpr if`.

Ranges is definitely worth learning but that's a C++20ism.  `std::expected` is super helpful to know but that's a C++20ism as well.  (Just to know there are more ways to handle exceptions and which to use.)

They teach perfect forwarding in classes you go to?  What classes are you taking?  That's impressive.  I'd say `std::move` is super important to know and understand, but it's a given if you understand ownership semantics.

Oh, there are new keywords.  `default` and `delete` should be used liberally when creating a new class, in conjunction with the 0,3,5 idiom.  `override` is important on the inheritance front, and imho should be enforced using a compiler flag.

Oh!  Threading and file handling have had a complete over hall.  Now C++ does it instead of using the OS' libraries.  Threading is a bit of a sinkhole and should be known inside and out if you're working on your own project.  If the project is large enough the framework should handle all of the threading for you.  Otherwise, it is important.  (eg, lockfree programming is kind of important in most situations.)

And of course lambdas.  Super useful.  No more `void *`.  I can't believe I almost forgot them.  Pass code around, not variables.

RVO is important when considering ownership semantics.  Basically, don't `std::move` on return unless necessary.  Don't return a pointer or a reference unless necessary.

Gosh there was something else..

Let's see, inheritance isn't taught right in any book or class I've seen.  There is a prerequisite of understanding how to make types.  This is important for quant work, because you'll probably be using custom types everywhere.  Learning how to make them in C++ is important, not just use them, because it builds the prerequisite conceptual understanding for multiple inheritance.

Inheritance in Haskell terms is subtyping or abstract typing.  Abstract classes (not necessarily fully abstract, just not concrete) are a type of class, sometimes called a subtype or abstract type.  Inheritance isn't just for gluing code together.  It's for having types of classes, or categories of classes.  This is something understood on a senior level, but because it is so difficult to understand modern languages tend to just ban multiple inheritance out right.  C++ has it, so understanding the thought process to not doing it right, but *thinking* about it right, is important.

I'm sure there is more.  Oh, there is a new syntax Herb Sutter has been pushing which is pretty great, if the whole code base has it.  .... and I can't find the video.  The skinny is `int foo(double bar)` becomes `auto foo(double bar) -&gt; int`.  The philosophy is the function name should be as far as possible to the left hand side to make code more readable, because types can get stupidly long sometimes.  The C++98 equiv, which thankfully most of the code bases I've worked on do:

   int
   foo(double bar)

Oh and `std::variant` combined with `constexpr` replaces unions.

Basically, if it's in C there is a C++ equiv.  Use that instead.  The exception is native types, and functions.  Even loops have changed to range based for loops eg `for(auto it : foo)` and with `std::for_each`, though C style loops are still useful and used sometimes.  Oh and structs are still around and can be popular, but `std::variant` or `std::all` might be a better option depending on what you're doing.

And the most important saved for last.  Read http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines learn it, love it.  For example, checkout F.15.  Super helpful.  This is official, so you can use it for coding disputes and what not.

2018-10-07 23:13:02,"Yes my hypothesis is on the later assumption. People searching for ""Buy Bitcoin"" tend to be net new people getting into the market. The ones searching for ""BTC USD"" already own BTC and is a signal of upcoming volatility (i.e. values that get to the local maximum of 100 tend to precede a price drop).  My theory is that if both search terms are high (i.e. a 3:1 ratio or higher) this signifies that there is more buy interest and an active pool of current investors.

2018-10-06 16:10:15,"For Data Science work I tend to use R, Java (Data Engineering), and Python.

For Quant work I tend to use C++17 (modern C++, the kind not taught in classes), and CUDA (and OpenMP).  The reason for this is most of the patterns I've found tend to be rather cpu intensive, so the Quant work I do is like Data Science + Data Engineering.  ymmv.  (Interoping with R or Python too.)

I've considered Scala but haven't picked it up, and Rust as well if GPU bindings get more mature.

Really, what I want is a language as fast as C++ or Java with fast compile times.  I'd use Java, but I need to make my own types making Java not a good choice.  Back in the early thousands Java was the choice in the industry and it really wasn't a good idea.  This is why modern C++ got picked up around '13-'14 in the industry.  But my last quant job was in '16, so who knows what it is now."

2018-10-06 14:24:33,"Yeah, I have been looking into Data Science internships for next summer. 

&gt;but most quant related work I've seen requires quite a bit of programming skill, more than a normal data scientist.

Which languages have you seen used most often? I know some R and SAS and I have been learning Python. Should I focus on other languages as well?

&gt;In short: How's your programming skill

I think I am decent in R and am learning Python fairly quickly. Though I have not taken any classes in Python yet and am teaching myself. "
2018-10-06 14:20:13,"Honestly, I would rather not go that path. I am already enrolled in university, I get paid to attend, and I am graduating in a year."
2018-10-06 12:48:28,"&gt; Do you guys hire people with just a Math/CS PhD? Or do you expect them to have knowledge of finance as well

We consider all stem PhDs and sometimes finance PhDs, but the ones who get the most offers are from math (pure and applied), stats, physics, CS (think AI or optimization, not operating system design), EE,  operations research.  finance phds are usually hired for ""quantimental"" groups - i.e.  quantitative fundamental, of which there are quite a few.  

you probably wouldn't be asked much in the way of finance questions unless you were actually a finance phd.  math and physics phds usually aren't expected to know any finance.  if you're really interested in finance, you should probably learn a little so it shows your interested, but i've never asked a finance question at an interview and my friends/colleagues never do either.

i have to qualify this a bit:  if you decide to apply for jobs doing options pricing, you will definitely get asked questions about it.   you'll need to know the basics or Black-Scholes and the like and they require some study.   get a copy of ""options futures and other derivatives"" if you're going to apply for options pricing jobs.

&gt;  Do you know of any Quant funds that give internships to undergrads

I'm sure they exist, but I don't know them off the top of my head.

&gt;  Honestly, it seems like a lot ...   How much is the starting compensation at your fund?

Having a B.S. in computer science these days is enough to get you $150-200k from Google or FB (counting stock options), so this isn't really a lot in this job market.  this is a good time to be graduating.  when i was graduating, 2008 was happening.  sigh.......

Starting pay at the couple of funds i've worked at is usually 150-200 salary and we guarantee your first year's bonus.  typically another 100k.   pay usually goes upward pretty quickly.   i know a guy who just got 150k  + 350k starting bonus offer.  within a few years, you're possibly making several times this, if (a) you're good and (b) your firm is doing reasonably well.

2018-10-06 11:39:11,"&gt; HOWEVER it usually starts with an internship junior year, so it is hard to be hired of that hasn't happened.

So my situation is a bit weird. I am a junior, but I am just in my 3rd semester. Last summer I was a sophomore and couldn't get any good internships so I just took classes instead. I will be trying to get a good internship next summer. 

Do you think that I should be looking at internships in Data Science like someone else mentioned or just I be going directly for a Quant fund internship? Do you know of any quant funds that have internships for undergrads that you would recommend?"
2018-10-06 11:26:15,"I have read many of the replies and some are misleading in the sense that, because one's own firm only hires PhDs, they are concluding that that all firms only hire PhDs these days.

That isn't the case. Different firms have different policies any many still hire straight out of college with graduates only having a BS in fields like math, cs, math/cs, physics, etc. Recruiters from big firms still make visits to undergrad programs at certain schools with which they have had good past results. HOWEVER it usually starts with an internship junior year, so it is hard to be hired of that hasn't happened."
2018-10-06 10:51:31,"Makes sense. Do you guys hire people with just a Math/CS PhD? Or do you expect them to have knowledge of finance as well. Like at the interview, would you ask Math PhDs any finance related questions that they should self study for or do you just ask Math related questions? 

&gt;we do plenty of internships, however. so you could try to get one, but they're usually given to phd students who are a year or two away from getting their degree.

Do you know of any Quant funds that give internships to undergrads? Obviously I would prefer to work at a good Quant fund rather than an investment bank so I would like to actually see what they would do on a day to day basis. 

&gt; a berkeley MFE should get you that. it's not a lot by finance standards.

Honestly, it seems like a lot to me because I'm getting my bachelors in 2.5 years and would be able to get the MFE and a job paying that much when everyone else in my year is still in undergrad. How much is the starting compensation at your fund?

we do plenty of internships, however.  so you could try to get one, but they're usually given to phd students who are a year or two away from getting their degree.

the bit about the $160k is probably correct, however.  a berkeley MFE should get you that.  it's not a lot by finance standards.  no idea how hard it is to get into one.  i imagine they're somewhat competitive, and probably the better ones are pretty expensive.   

i take issue with the following remark, however:  ""Is getting a high paying job like that right after a 1 year masters really something that's doable or are firms more focused on hiring PhDs now?""    both are true.  the 160k is possible but it probably won't be a quant fund.

2018-10-06 01:04:03,"And internship can go a long way, farther than a degree, but I haven't heard of a quant internship.  An alternative is an intern as a software engineer or as a data scientist, or something similar.  Though, you could just get lucky without an internship.  Maybe you can do some analytics and figure out a rough probability of how advantageous it is to get an internship.

I don't know the entire ecosystem, but most quant related work I've seen requires quite a bit of programming skill, more than a normal data scientist.  And of course, mathematics and statistics helps quite a bit, but it's the type of job that requires proficiency in multiple areas.

XGboost and random forest are pretty much the swiss army knife of modeling tabular data in industry. Regardless of whatever theoretical problems you think they have.

I would suggest minimising volatility with a shrunk covariance matrix.""

This makes sense in the context of your last sentence: although stock correlations aren't consistent over time, they \[probably\] change more slowly than returns, which jump all over the place (otherwise we'd all be rock start algo traders!). Consequently minimizing volatility (correlation) for time step t probably has more of a chance of being relevant in time step t+1 than maximising returns."

2018-10-05 11:10:51,"IBKR does have a REST API, but it's only good for market data. If you want to place orders or do anything more than get market data, then you have 2 choices:

1) Their proprietary API that uses TWS/IB Gateway.

2) FIX which is as close to an industry standard as you're going to get. Many brokers won't offer FIX access to retail clients and those that do tend to charge extra for it. IB will allow you FIX, but you have to agree to a minimum commission payment of $1500/mo. Provided you're paying $1500/mo in commissions anyway, FIX is free, but if not, then you're effectively paying the difference for FIX (ie your commissions would be $400, then you're paying $1100 extra because of FIX).

If you don't want to lock yourself in to IB, you could pick a platform that supports multiple brokers, but then you're still locking yourself in to that specific platform software.

TDA has a web API, but I've not used it and have no idea what it's abilities/limits are. They do support futures, but their commissions aren't great.

Aside from FIX, you're going to have to lock yourself in to something. You could create your own abstraction layer that provides a REST API to your trading software and communicates with the proprietary API of your broker. This will help to isolate your platform specific code in the event you need to change. Not ideal of course, but there's no real industry standard. FIX is as close as you can get. Even if brokers supported REST APIs, it's still not going to be a standard, so you should create an abstraction layer either way."

I'm not going to get into a detailed debate about microstructure and whether it's easy or not to use a broker's api because the fact remains, at the levels many posters here are dealing with, it's not a viable option to connect directly to the exchanges' data flow.

Not all broker apis are as bad as you think. They have a lot of resources to put into their code to parse the messages for you very fast. Work you will have to do anyway that has been done for you, and a poster here probably requires the broker to make the trades anyway. It's not a bad option.

2019-04-15 21:20:58,"You’re getting into the contractual and regulatory details that I’m not an expert on. If you’re to the point of attracting investors I’d think you’d be able to hire a good attorney in this area. You might be able to modify the contract to add language to better protect your strategy. 

But the fact remains, you will still be more protected with well regulated brokers. Shady brokers do exactly what you describe. They front run your orders, or they simply trade against the unprofitable traders, meaning they just hold your money until you go bust as put your entire account in their pocket. 

At least with regulated markets and exchanges, you could in theory look at tome and sales data and possibly prove that your broker is front running you, and I suspect they would risk far more by breaking the law than copying strategies. 

There’s risk of a rogue individual working at the broker trying this, but that’s the same in any business where you’re trying to protect trade secrets. It’s a hard, expensive problem to solve.

You would much prefer to be with a regulated broker who can’t front run (by law).

Maybe put your trades across multiple brokers so it’s not obvious that every time a scenario triggers that you place a trade.

Do you have anything useful to add to the conversation now or would you like to continue to try and shit on me?"
2019-04-15 13:29:58,"You could also look at this from a different perspective. For example looking at the mechanics of how the financial markets operate.

&amp;#x200B;

Markets open with an auction where traders can quote prices to buy and sell at. This is known as price discovery. Price discovery is a key part of how markets operate as it allows any information that has been released overnight to be incorporated into the price of the asset. 

For example company XYZ releases earnings after market on a Monday. The price is likely to change during the auction on Tuesday to reflect investors thought and views on the new information contained in the earnings release.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time however for companies there is very little news over night and therefore little new information to be traded on the following day.  Because of this if you take a large enough sample of assets, it is highly ,likely as you have proven, that a buy close and sell open strategy will not work. In this case as well you have not considered fees, which compounds the problem.

However there will be cases where buying close before an event and selling during the open can produce a profit, but some people may call this gambling rather than investing or trading."

2019-04-15 10:57:19,"interesting, thanks for the explaination"
2019-04-15 10:52:50,"if it enters a long at a lower price than it exited the previous long, it gets a reward that is the difference between the position value after executing the trade, and the position value had it never sold in the first place.  Example: agent sells 100 shares at $10, then buys them back at $9.  The position value when it goes long is $1,000 (minus fees and slippage), whereas had it never sold, the position value would have been $900, so it gets a reward of 100.  Well, not 100, because I scale it relative to the other rewards, but you get the idea.

The agent (DQN) has 3 actions, buy, sell, hold.  It can get a positive or negative reward for buying or selling, but if the action is hold, the reward is always 0.  The ""hypothetical reward"" is just part of the observation that it receives at each step."

2019-04-15 09:56:14,"&gt;so it only gets a reward (positive or negative) when entering or exiting a trade.

I don't exactly get this, you reward him for entering a trade, is that a fixed reward then?

&amp;#x200B;

Also you say you reward it 0 for holding, but you do reward it for "" hypothetical reward that it would have received if it entered/exited a trade on previous step "" but when do you give this reward then? when opening and closing?"
2019-04-15 09:54:09,"Good point, i do understand what you mean, but as i said earlier i believe and have seen that by defining exactly what is happening with the actions, the agent will figure out what it all means. Also a high GAMMA should solve part of this problem"
2019-04-15 09:32:52,"So a few things... first of all no one is going to give you the good stuff. Not to sound harsh but finding a bot that you can just plug in your conditions isn't very realistic and i don't even think it's that helpful tbh. Algo trading is something where you really should learn to code. Not because you may or may not be able to find the resources you are looking for out there, but more so that you really understand what is going on at a fundamental level. Nothing gives you a firmer grasp of what is happening under the hood than coding the back tester yourself, the execution engine, the conditions and metrics. Also by coding your own metrics and conditions, you get the added benefit of making then as flexible as possible, knowing what the metrics are actually doing, and then being able to tweak them a little bit if you have other ideas.

If you start with python i'd guess you could get a decent back tester up in a few days. From there's it's just a matter of getting some data, preprocessing it (a beast on it's own), and then playing around with your conditions until you see some results. You always want to split your data up into train and validation data. The train data is what you will try to design your algo around to get profits, and the validation will basically say that your algo can carry over to data you have not seen yet. I will tell you right now i've experienced first hand countless times where a strategy will work really well on a bunch of data, and then be completely useless on data it hasn't seen yet. Validation data is just as important as anything else.

Last but not least building a profitable bot is a long and tough road and you should mentally prepare for that to be the case. I think you should treat it as a hobby and something that will likely take a while before you're competitive. Don't bank on it for side income and that you will get something decent up and running in a few weeks. I wouldn't even consider running real money on your bot until you reliably see some sort of edge on your validation data."

2019-04-15 08:39:48,The pipeline/process should be agnostic to the market or instrument you're trading. The steps to make the algo will be similar aside from the core edge you're exploiting.

2019-04-15 07:41:00,"here is something I tried last night, and was pleasantly surprised to wake up to this morning when it completed.  I kept the reward scheme the same, so it only gets a reward (positive or negative) when entering or exiting a trade.  Holding always returns a 0 reward.  But I added a new field to my observations that included the hypothetical reward that it would have received if it entered/exited a trade on previous step.  Even though the hypothetical reward is always higher than the real one (because the hypothetical reward doesn't include fees or slippage), it responded very well once tested on unseen data."

2019-04-15 03:04:31,"1. Apache Hadoop

The long-standing victor in the field of Big Data handling, surely understood for its capacities for enormous scale information preparing. This open source Big Data system can keep running on-prem or in the cloud and has very low equipment prerequisites. The primary Hadoop advantages and highlights are as per the following:

HDFS — Hadoop Distributed File System, situated at working with immense scale transfer speed

MapReduce — a exceptionally configurable model for Big Data preparing

YARN — a asset scheduler for Hadoop asset the executives

Hadoop Libraries — the required paste for empowering outsider modules to work with Hadoop

2. Apache Spark

Apache Spark is the alternative — and in numerous perspectives the successor — of Apache Hadoop. Flash was worked to address the weaknesses of Hadoop and it does this amazingly well. For instance, it can process both bunch information and ongoing information, and works multiple times quicker than MapReduce. Sparkle gives the in-memory information handling capacities, which is path quicker than plate preparing utilized by MapReduce. Furthermore, Spark works with HDFS, OpenStack and Apache Cassandra, both in the cloud and on-prem, adding another layer of adaptability to enormous information tasks for your business intelligence.

3. Apache Storm

Tempest is another Apache item, a continuous system for information stream preparing, which bolsters any programming language. Tempest scheduler adjusts the outstanding task at hand between various hubs dependent on topology setup and functions admirably with Hadoop HDFS. Apache Storm has the accompanying advantages:

Extraordinary level adaptability

Worked in adaptation to internal failure

Auto-restart on accidents

Clojure-composed

Works with Direct Acyclic Graph(DAG) topology

Yield documents are in JSON design

4. Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is one of the columns behind Facebook's gigantic achievement, as it permits to process organized informational collections conveyed crosswise over tremendous number of hubs over the globe. It functions admirably under substantial remaining tasks at hand because of its design without single purposes of disappointment and flaunts one of a kind abilities no other NoSQL or social DB has, for example,

Extraordinary liner adaptability

Effortlessness of activities because of a straightforward question language utilized

Consistent replication crosswise over hubs

Straightforward including and expulsion of hubs from a running bunch

High adaptation to internal failure

Worked in high-accessibility

5. MongoDB

MongoDB is another incredible case of an open source NoSQL business [data analytics company in UAE](https://www.alpha.ae/contact-us/) with rich highlights, which is cross-stage perfect with many programming dialects. IT Svit utilizes MongoDB in an assortment of distributed computing and observing arrangements, and we explicitly built up a module for computerized MongoDB reinforcements utilizing Terraform. The most conspicuous MongoDB highlights are:

Stores any sort of information, from content and whole number to strings, clusters, dates and boolean

Cloud-local sending and extraordinary adaptability of arrangement

I am basically competing with other people on the same server, which are running their own algos. There is no opportunity to hedge as it is the only security being traded. The case is basically to see if our algorithm can capture quick movements in the market using the bid/ask spreads. Now I could go basic and make sure that I only send in orders when a paired order (bid/ask) is filled and executed otherwise RESET. The question is mostly along the line of how do I optimize my algo to choose the best bid/ask quotes depending on the liquidity, market depth, etc, etc. and also implement a good position sizing technique.

That being said, of course you should use 1 day as the time to maturity if you’re trying to price an option with 1 day left to expiration. Why would you use 10 days?

Bigger picture here, I’m not sure exactly how you’ve set up your backtest, but it sounds like you’re trying to get strategy results using theoretical option prices instead of *actual* observed prices. Unless you have full, super granular historical implied volatility surfaces to back out the real market prices at that time, your results are going to be waaaaay off from what actually happened in real life.

2019-10-23 10:52:25,"In my experience, it will take a bit to get used to building the infrastructure and find the proper data sources ect. That will mostly be dependent on how familiar you are with code and trading. 

But once you have that set up, the length of time to build the algorithm will related to how complex your algorithm is. To give a stupidly simple example: the S&amp;P 500 goes up on roughly 55% of all days so a passive strategy that just hold the S&amp;P 500 would be a profit super simple system to create. But if you want the model to day trade a rotating portfolio of S&amp;P 500, oil, gold, and bonds based on technical and fundamental indicators along with web scraped news articles then that will take far more time to figure out which indicators you want to use and how you any to allocate the portfolio. Then you have rinse and repeat until you find the right combination of allocations and indicators while not biasing your data. You can see both of these are profitable systems but the one that takes longer to build will likely make you more in the long-term if you figure out how to make something really impressive."

Yep, that makes sense. I also generally tend to use a more strict assumptions.

There are a lot of tricks to achieve better queue positions, but I'm not really an HFT trader, so maybe someone else could comment on that.

2019-10-23 04:32:34,"are you saying that you're always having your quote hit and then can never get rid of what you've bought/sold ?  what are the limits of your inventory that you're breaking.

as you're only on one instrument, it's real hard to do anything by hold that instrument until you can cross the spread for profit ( the alternative obv being you cross the spread for a loss and then you go bankrupt :-)  ).

what sort of product is the security ( outright, derivative, etc ) - if it's a derivative ( tbh I'm thinking option ) you can offset your risk by delta hedging, if it's an outright ( stock ) and thats the only stock on the exchange you're screwed. if it's an outright and there are other instruments available you may be able to similarly hedge against other highly corrolated instruments.

what are the rules of being a market maker ( do you always have to be top of book, do you have other quoting requirements like you have to quote the tightest spread for n time periods )? You may be able to only quote when you want to and hence once you get above a certain threshold widen your spread/shallow out so you're less attractive or lean your spread/depth so your advertising that you're a seller when youre inventory heavy. if there is a correlated benchmark your instrument is trading against you can maybe use a mean reversion calc to see when you want to quote aggressively and when you want to quote less attractively.

what is the microstructure of the market ( order book, shared, etc ), who are the other players.

I think it could still work, but probably the results would not be much better than your hand-tuned results because the model is so simple. You could try gradient boosting with max\_depth=2 and two estimators to get a first idea. I do not use the accuracy score. Instead, I work with a threshold, precision and recall (this is absolutely crucial for success). In the backtests, I get the highest profit for a precision between 55% and 57%. But if I wanted to, I could have a precision of 60% or higher (although for more recent backtests such high precision is rare). For reasons I don't want to explain, the actual win rate is a bit lower than the precision though."

I am maker in 90%+ of the cases. So yes, the profit comes basically ""only"" from fees (which is far from trivial though).

Sorry, I was not clear enough when I said that I assume a fill ratio of 1. In the backtests, I assume a fill ratio of 1 IF the prices moves over the price of my order. E.g. if I want to sell at 100 and if there is a buyer at 100.5, then I assume that my order has been filled and that the fill ratio is 1. This is not necessarily the case in reality, but since I do not know my exact position in the order book, it should not be a bad approximation. Later, I can still make even more pessimistic assumptions to scale it better.

&gt;Second algo is always quoting at best bid, then once filled, tries to sell at best offer, and back at trying to get filled at best bid  
&gt;  
&gt;Second algo has 0 alpha, but you can see how aweful your fill rate will be and how high the toxic fill ratio will be.

This is something I have tried more than a year ago and yes, the fill ratio there was awful.

I use my own backtesting code.

2020-04-30 17:20:50,"Okay let's say you have some budget in some currency. And you have n goods that you can choose from in varying quantities. Than usually in micro economics you model the space of all possible baskets of goods as R^n . You have some preferences that order these baskets. So for example you stricly prefer 2 pizzas over 1 pizza for the same price. 

Usually the real world does some funny stuff though for example you can't buy π/4- Pizzas.
So you may actually only be able to buy pizzas in integer multiples. That's already a more complicated basket.

Now Imagine a funny basket where the goods depend on each other in a weird way which is dictated by some differential function. For example if I buy t - many of good 1 then I also have to buy e^t many of good 2 and I maybe have a good 3 that is Independent of the First two. Then a possible basket of three goods is determined by two of these already by f(t,x)=(t, e^t ,x).
So the set of all possible baskets form a 2d hypersurface in R^3 .
This of course can be generalized to some sufficiently nice differential manifold which can represent a complicated way that goods you may want to buy depend on each other."

2020-11-07 00:14:32,"You are right, and this is why it is NOT ""just the strategy"" that matters. There is a reason that pay for quantitative developers at top trading firms and funds is not 1%, not 10% but are anywhere from 50-90% of the pay for the average quantitative researcher at these firms, depending on the frequency of the strategy. Implementation details matter, and can make or break a system. The market recognizes this and remunerates quantitative developers accordingly. This is the best evidence I can present that to be a serious quantitative trader of an intraday strategy, you need to be both an excellent analyst and an excellent programmer.

Obviously, for strategies acting at a daily or lower frequency, there is less need for such careful software development. But we are in r/algotrading, after all, and I think this implies that most of us are interested in some kind of full automation."

2020-11-06 23:48:52,The real advantage with algo trading (my strategy anyway) is having very exact and similar (small) losers and then allowing winners to run. Entries and limiting losses are important. Backtesting and tuning needs to be done for each instrument you’re trading at length before you set it live. Any corner cutting will increase losses. Performing proper diligence can help a ton. Don’t ever set something live until it’s absolutely proven for your instrument in an assortment of market conditions.

I can give you an example from my own research: I had a feeling that hourly ranges were not as random as a random walk would imply.

Using the lags where the ACF showed significant autocorrelation + other features I engineered from the price data I looked at feature importance and used the most important ones for my model."

My primary research indicated that using python and selenium would be an effective way to create a bot to perform the desired tasks, with the goal of avoiding api because I am new to code. I explored this briefly but was quickly bogged down. 

My question are:

1. Would python and selenium be effective at preforming this task? If so what are some good resources to learn how to build something like this out? 

2. Does something like this already exist? I saw a few things on GitHub, but I was somewhat leery as I will be hooking up my account to this.

2020-11-06 22:57:55,"Excellent suggestions the both of you! I was excited about this idea too since it seems like a more appropriate application of ML to trading than the typical signal hunt people try to use it for. 

Unfortunately I have only found underwhelming results. I did almost exactly what you suggest, u/xbno, where I create a ""market state"" vector at my entry point that consists of a large number of current values of price, volume, and order book information for the set of futures assets I follow and think are important. I let my automated system find entries and then label the ones I skipped from my live trade log.

Then I trained a slew of simple models – random forest, logistic regression, xgboost, extra random forest, KNN with k=1, and SVM – individually to classify signals as either take or skip. 

The classes are extremely unbalanced since there are a relatively small number of skips even though they have a large impact on long term results. Coupled with the smallish sample size to begin with there was really no predictive power, at least for the ""market state"" features I chose. 

I lost steam after that, but I'd like to take it up again one day. A glaring shortcoming of my test is that my ""market state"" vector was a snapshot of values *right now*. I think there would be a better chance of something like this working if I had some notion of recent history and context. It does start to get messy though with each feature being a time series and honestly I'm not sure I even could get the data into the right form without spending a decent amount of time on it."
2020-11-06 22:48:41,"I agree with this. I can tell you that from tons of testing of hundreds of strategies great majority of them fail to beat the market. The number one problem I am seeing is the impact of the market as a whole and the volatility of the market, both are next to impossible to predict.

2020-11-06 17:06:30,"That's how I started.  It was through manual trading that I found a way that I could consistently make a small amount of money in a single symbol.  I found a way to automate it, then tried running the algorithm on a few more symbols.  I was suprised that it performed well so I continually scaled it by trading larger quantities and more symbols.  At this point my algo will get into positions now on about 300 different US equities and ETFs on a given day.   I had no idea what I was doing would scale to this level and I'm continuing to scale even at this point.  You really can't know until you try.  Just be smart about managing risk, don't put any significant amount of money into it until you are confident in your performance

For me it was an enormous investment of time up front.  I easily put in 60-80 hours a week the first month or two, but the more I automate the less it requires of me.  At this point, I spend about 30 minutes after the opening and 30 minutes at the close actually looking at the markets.  I get alerts on my phone if anything unusual happens, which is most days but I've had a few days recently where I haven't had anything that needed attention.   I work on major code changes and new strategies when I'm inspired to do so.  


Profitability really depends on you.  Contrary to what people say, there is a great deal of opportunity out there.  It sounds like you've found something that works, so I imagine the limits on your profitability are only bound by how far you can scale it."

* what happens if you have bad data (cosmic ray, fat finger)  
* what happens if you have NO data. (internet outage, DOS attacK)   
* what happens if you have screwy data (you did somethingurself)

Bottom line is that there are still a lot of moving parts that require a disciplined and logical approach if you are planning on making money and not losing it for stupid reasons.

Most algos that people build aren't able to scale to what a fund on wall st needs. You would be more useful at a firm if you had learned how to do one specific thing or worked on some sort of research. Also it pays more to be an entry level quant than to manage money, and its hard to scale a fund without any help or experience. If you are a good quant you'll get blessed from a firm or made PM."

If you have a strategy, even if you are running it manually, you are letting the strategy trade for you. Imo this is algo trading already.

Programming a bot to trade for you, is the easy part. As long as your trading strategy is !00% formulaic(you might have a little emotion getting into some of your trades manually) then turning it into a bot is fine. For as long as your strategy works. Markets do change."
2020-11-06 13:02:24,"As others have mentioned, you probably won't be latency competitive without some extensive software and infrastructure investment.

Also note fee structures and other frictions. Exchanges will give much better fees to the big volume firms that are already in the game - meaning you don't have a chance to even play at the same table until you've got volume behind you.

On top of this, sometimes a longer term pricing gap will exist for other reasons which can't be arbed away easily: 

 * difference in microstructure/ derivatives contract spec
 * exchange reputation/ solvency fears
 * currency and nationality issues (South Korea not allowing foreign crypto traders, leading to a disconnect in price in the past)."
2020-11-06 13:01:59,"Hi, I am just another roboticist /software architect who loves maths, ran 2 tech  companies in the emerging technology services sector and is  now  digging algorithmic trading and the psychology of traders from an academic standpoint 

From a computational thinking and problem solving standpoint, I look at this as the biggest challenge :
Your algorithm would have to mathematically account for the set of  all market situations in which trades can be performed which as far as I have currently understood  is an ever expanding set given different companies with different DNAs entering and evolving spending - buying patterns of traders of all sizes. The problem is that most algorithms work for a subset of these market trading situations. Most of the  existing statistical indicators may or may not work based on which situations they have accounted for. Stock market and democracy have very similar patterns if u observe consumer interest. 

   The easiest way I have found to express a trading strategy algorithmically is figuring out a sequence of trades which can convert an initial investment A into something bigger B hopefully over a period of time T. So, that becomes an equation of sorts to work with and optimize based on the number of moves N chosen for  T.

I'm not very familiar with S3, but from looking at the amazon page I think it is similar to azure storage accounts. you need to be a bit more specific since these are fairly general and there are dozens of different storage types depending on your needs, file storage, unstructured data storage, serverless SQL storage, big data globally distributed storage, etc. Generally you pay the most for file storage. If you are storing data that isn't necessarily related, less structured storage like table storage is generally cheaper but you have to design your storage architecture around not using table joins like you would use in SQL

And so in that sense people are not getting away from banks. And people from banks btw are not blind to the money in crypto, and they are enjoying the beefy salaries pretending to change the future! Same with software engineers. 

Also traditional finance already tried unregulated free markets and it didn't work so I don't know why this is suddenly the ideal in crypto. something like bitcoin could actually be more regulated than fiat.

2021-05-15 17:54:13,"In that case, you're on the right track.  In fact, I use S3 to store CSV stock price data and use Glue + Athena to query the data.  It works well and is very cost-effective.

Some advice:  if you're not using IaC currently, you should.  I use Terraform, but the AWS CDK or something like Serverless may work for you as well.  Depending on your intended workflow, you may want to consider building an interface layer for you app through API Gateway (for a REST API) or AppSync (for GraphQL) and use Lambdas to resolve the endpoints.  I find storing application data in DynamoDB works well in an ""internal"" application like this, and it's pretty cheap/scales well.

Using these kinds of resources, you can separate infrastructure based on functionality/responsibility pretty easily and build them as components which have loose dependencies between one another (i.e., microservices).  All the components interact with each other through the interface (i.e., API Gateway or AppSync), so everything stays organized and operate as independently as possible.

Depending on how much data you're working with and how much compute you're using, an architecture like this can be run very lean and cheap."

2021-05-15 16:59:24,I agree with you. I always look for managed versions of open source tools then you can always run it your self if you need to.
2021-05-15 16:56:32,Azure engineer here. You could use azure functions and one of the dbs like table storage or cosmos. Unless you are doing millions of transactions it isn’t that expensive. I have my own business tenant for learning and when i don’t want to break work production environment. You’ll need to understand cloud architecture since designing a scalable solution isn’t typically point and click unless someone has a pre build container image and you just need to scale it out
2021-05-15 16:53:28,"It depends on the amount of data and how long you need the access to the data.  For example AWS glacier is very cheap but can't be accessed without waiting up to 12hrs.

S3 is cheap and simple but it is an object store Not a database or hard disk. So you would need to rework your solution to work with this.

EFS (elastic file store) can be mounted to an EC2 server and used like a hard drive. This would be better to use for back testing and searching but far more expensive. 

Lambda functions are cheap and can be run on a Cron secular so depending on your frequency of collection this might be good option.

 You can look at GCP app engine instead of lightsail as it is easier to manage than a hole server and can be cheaper but needs less rework to run applications than lambda does. 
GCP also has a lot of good analysis tools as you would expect from Google, like big query that are easy to use on any size of data.

Importantly all the cloud platforms offer a free tier and as a student you can also get extra free credits. For Azure credits it used to be part of MSDN for students."

2021-11-22 09:34:10,"Markovian models are ubiquitous but in financial applications mostly appear in compliance. They tend to be too naive for price prediction due to their distinctive memoryless property. Markov random fields are a nice extension but also memoryless and appear often in physical models. Hidden Markov models are another nice extension that accounts for latent variables, i.e., non-observable features; they are common in machine learning curricula. If you truly find an instrument whose state (not necessarily a price quote or its rate of change) would not depend on the history but only on the present state, then you’re good to go with a Markovian assumption in your model. Otherwise you’d be neglecting some perhaps crucial piece of dependency structure inherent to the time-series. Just to reiterate, price is not the only component of an instrument’s state that you can model."

Algotrading is continuous improvement over many years, you will keep on changing/modifying/enhancing the system....

My suggestion is whichever you are better for your scalability, choose it. When I want to decide about this five years before, I had the same dilemma what to choose.

I have excellent experience with oracle, then 2nd mysql, then 3rd mongodb. I consulted my friend, had one hour discussion, finally we both convinced better to stay with our own expert field, done oracle, single user paid license, got it.

Till date, we are happy with out decision as we can enhance the system every time we wanted to improve. We have two rack servers, one at Arizona and another at California.

2021-11-21 10:52:00,How good is the compression for influxdb for tickdata? Can you maybe share some stats? Currently using parquet files and might want to transition to either influx or timescale.
2021-11-21 10:50:50,"I've worked in data management and specifically worked in building a ""security price master"" so I have some thoughts about this.

First of all, you need to ensure you're requesting prices for the correct security.  Tickers can undergo ticker changes so while requesting by ticker can be ""okay"" it's certainly not the best way.  Best to request by identifier such as SEDOL or combination of CUSIP/ISIN and exchange code and possibly also by currency.  You might not be able to do all of that but just throwing it out there that your price data is only as good as the reference security ID that you've requested it for.

One you have the security price, you should validate it.  /u/funkinaround mentioned having multiple price sources.  If you have 2+ sources then you can validate the price against each source and if there is a difference of more than say a penny, you raise a validation exception.  Maybe you have a dashboard where these failed validations pop up and you need to manually  review, accept, or reject the price for that timestamp.  Maybe you have an option to manually correct too if you want to get into doing that but that can be a lot of work depending on the size of the universe you're requesting prices for and how many times a day.  Might not be possible to handle as a solo gig.

If you're dealing with just one price source then the best you might be able to do is compare the percentage change between the current pull and the last pull.  If it's over a certain tolerance % then you hold that price or don't allow it to flow through as a validated ""master price.""  Then you can have this pop up on a dashboard for you to review, approve/reject, correct as well.  OR... you throw in some additional logic where if the price pulls AFTER the ""out of tolerance"" pull return to within tolerance range, the ""out of tolerance"" pull is automatically thrown out and gets placed into a 'rejected prices table' so you have a historical record and can review what's going on.

I'd advise some ""mastering"" logic where you have prices from multiple sources.  The sources can be: manual price, yahoo, iex cloud, etc..   Even if you're only using 1 vendor such as yahoo, you'd still have 2 price sources because you could always input a manual price or manual correction so ""manual"" is another price source, the source is you.  Thus your mastering logic would be to always use a manual price first, if that's not available, then use the next best quality vendor, if that's not available, then use the next best quality second vendor, and so on.

It's a bit of work yes but this is the system that professional investment firms use in some form to manage and ensure they are valuing their securities and ultimately portfolios correctly."

2022-05-31 04:27:57,"Thanks for the input - interesting observation!

I'm still double-checking a lot of things and being skeptical towards these results. And it does seem that the tighter stop-losses are heavily dependent on fee assumptions."
2022-05-31 03:53:27,Higher and higher profit and consistency as your dollar based stop loss gets smaller and smaller is an indication of a backtesting error from my experience. You might be underestimating your commission and slippage which compounds greatly as you churn your trades more frequently with tighter stop losses.
2022-05-31 03:23:23,"&gt;can you clue me in on what the SEC fees mean

Mostly section 31 fee.

&gt;I have an algorithm that can make decent returns somewhat consistently without fees, but I scrapped it because it still couldn't overcome the 0.1% crypto-exchange fee rate.

Yea, I have to admit I don't know how anyone could seriously actively trade crypto with a fee schedule like that.

The only way I got close was using Bitmex and their ""refunds"" but even then, just too much money burned on fees."

2022-05-31 01:49:12,I have backrested this strategy a long time ago on multiple assets. The problem was when the price crosses above and below the trading area multiple times a day and that's likely to happen in many assets every day. I used pure SQL coding to backtest that strategy.

2022-05-30 22:56:00,"Have you shown correlation between the coins/stocks? Adding data that’s not correlated will only hurt your model, not help.

You *could* add in what color socks I’m wearing on any given day to your model. Probably no good reason to, and it might give bad trade signals if one day I decide to wear blue socks instead of black. At best your model will learn to ignore uncorrelated data, at worst it will use it to influence decisions. More realistic example, feeding in the S&amp;P500 to a Bitcoin algo probably isn’t going to be too helpful.

Even pretty strongly correlated coins/stocks (like BTC/ETH) may not help build a better model. Seeing them both rise or fall at the same time doesn’t help you know what to trade in the future. You (or your model) need to find indicators to trade that allow you to make a profit. It’s possible you could find indicators in another coin/stock, but you’ll probably have to think about what drives the market you’re trading.

My $0.02 would be to exercise caution when adding in any additional data. Make sure you know why you want to include it. Otherwise you’re adding in unnecessary complexity and risk to fit a model to uncorrelated data."
2022-05-30 22:50:57,"There are probably commercial solutions for this. I worked in the energy trading industry, and there are vendors for that there. We had an oracle db of market data replicated from a vendor. We also had our own internal databases. They were terabytes in size. They require a DBA.

When I would do projects, I would always populate data to a postgres db with the timescale plug-in. It's definitely possible to replicate that out.

I think the reason why you don't see that as an individual is because it would be too expensive for most. You can't just give access to a single db out, and replication isn't super easy.

Giving access like that makes it a lot easier for people to find incorrect data too, so you have to spend more time making sure your data is accurate. Keeping data clean is a pain in the ass."
2022-05-30 22:26:22,Micro futures such as MES (micro S&amp;P) should have sufficient liquidity for minimal slippage and the tick size is 1.25$ which is more easy to manage risk with.

The reason of offering an API is that you can be very specific (like a contract) in what you offer to users and what can they do with it, for example pagination, requests quotas.

2022-05-30 16:38:21,"OP, i have explored applying different fixed limit orders and stop losses to a strategy across many securities and training the best outcome, but i think this could be problematic. I still have data to analyze, but I think the amplitude of recent volatility is a good metric for scaling a stop loss and target gain rather than having a fixed one. If you are training and applying on a single specific coin/security, you may have better luck. But i have found the data of a single entity is not enough to identify a sound strategy. Scaling indicators among many coins/securities in the same category seems to be useful."

2022-05-30 13:04:09,"Fourier series can be a bit dicey for price movement analysis. There is a difference in time series analysis between cyclic and seasonal moment. TA books like Ehlers have kinda mushed the two together, but they are different things. Fourier analysis can be used for seasonal movement, but so can autocorrelation. 

There is a real risk to trying to use Fourier methods, and that is some of the so-called frequency spectrum is an artifact of how unadaptive the approach is. If, for example, you use DFT to approximate a square wave you'll get evidence of frequences that don't exist in the actual signal but are computational artifacts of how the sinusoids ocillate around the real signal. This matters because those artifacts are useless for prediction, they really are just a measurement of patterns in the residuals that stem from selecting the wrong way to analyze the data.

Which gets us back to cycles vs seasonal peridocity. Time series of price movements contain big waves of varying length and amplitude. Those are cycles, not seasons. And DFT will not handle those any better than it would a square wave."

2022-05-30 09:52:17,"To me, the terms are tightly coupled anyway. Let me explain why:

The way a lot of people use „DCA“ on Reddit is bullshit.

Keeping buying an asset - doesn’t matter if crypto or not - is not a sustainable strategy. DCA means dollar cost averaging, so it’s about the principle of buying an asset at different prices, to create a position that has an average price of the different purchase prices.

Now such a strategy can make sense. For instance, say you invest in something every month or so, sometimes you overpay, sometimes you underpay.

Now, the positions you accrue over time develop differently. Some assets perform better, some worse. Your portfolio becomes imbalanced. One way to rebalance that is to change the accumulation to your monthly purchases. Buy less of an asset that overperformed, and more of one that underperformed. This rebalances your portfolio automatically, and much faster than just DCAing (in the sense I wrote) your target allocation.

Obviously, this can be automated. You can add more rebalancing when the difference in performance becomes too large, then you need additional sales and purchases. But I’m terms of combining DCA with rebalancing that’s what I would do."
2015-11-05 13:01:07,"I think I get it. This industry seems to be incredibly secretive. Which, as someone who has mostly worked in other computer science fields, I find completely alien. But I get why it is the way it is. Nobody wants to give away the golden goose. Fine.

But what I don't get is the negative vibe. Why bag on the nobodys trying to share info if nobody else will? It's not like there's a bunch of really great informative quant conferences, and this guy posted someone's half-assed attempt at putting one together. As far as I know, there aren't any good ones, with top people spilling the beans on cutting edge techniques.

It's not that I necessarily disagree with your assessment of some of these people. I just don't think the snarky tone is called for."

2015-11-05 10:18:26,"Can you message me which ?=P

And obviously, nobody's going to put *the* secret sauce that takes thousands of man hours and doesn't have infinite capacity in a book to be consumed by everyone. But Wes Gray manages Alpha Architect, which has two ETFs out right now (which are still in drawdown, but for those that want to value invest, there you go). However, Wes Gray's book ""DIY Financial Advisor"" has a nice little ROBUST framework for asset allocation that does generate alpha if you believe that momentum will persist going forward.

Also, for the book ""Quantitative Trading With R"", the chapter I wrote (*on* backtesting, no less) uses systems written by an algo-trading partner here in Chicago, and I *have* worked in asset management and a hedge fund before. And the author of the rest of the book, Harry Georgakopoulos, is a quant in Chicago. Though the strategies themselves were toys, you can find my best foot forward on my blog. So, given what I can come up with, I'd think some of those bloggers know a thing or two.

2015-10-31 14:34:40,"Odd.. We've always used 'ticket' to represent a fixed fee per order regardless of share size. 

This is how I've heard it used by many others in the industry as well.

Ticket is just the word used to describe the old style trade tickets/orders hand written on the NYSE and American Exchange floors back in the day.

What you describe is more like 'average ticket cost', or average fees.. not ticket fees.

Not that it matters too much."
2015-10-31 12:13:26,I work at a quant shop and we are hiring interns. Message me if you're interested!
2015-10-29 10:50:30,"Well I know what my fixed costs are right? My per share commission, and interest depending on how long you hold. So using a pnl per share benchmark, I can judge if the model is profitable which is the only thing I care about :)

Yes, I currently trade prop both manually and quantitatively. I do evaluate other traders models pretty frequently when interviewing people for our firm. "
2015-10-29 10:12:06,"thanks. I did include a max drawdown in my final draft. P&amp;L per share is an interesting one, I have not come across that yet. Thanks. Are you currently a prop trader? Do you evaluate other people's algo's often?"
2015-10-29 08:12:01,"Yes. Extremely blatant.

This author is naive about that and the idea these others he is ""gaming"" won't very quickly change their behavior. "
2015-10-29 07:51:30,"In US markets at least that would likely be considered spoofing, and would run a significant regulatory risk."
2015-10-29 02:07:53,"&gt; the two largest factors I look at are avg p&amp;l per share and max drawdown

Regarding max drawdown, I once heard someone say that they had zero interest from big money, because their max drawdown was around 50%. The strategy must have been insanely profitable, because this dude claimed he could climb out of the deficit quickly, however with such a huge max drawdown no large investors would touch it, he said."

2015-10-28 12:50:21,"Nasdaq is even weirder in terms of how the auction works, I was referring to listed names. But yeah, the closing auction is pretty neat"
2015-10-28 12:47:37,"I just mean the Russell shows that with preparation lots of size goes off at the close without huge price moves. And yeah, I know you can only do imbalance offset after 3:50 on NASDAQ, I didn't want to get into specifics but the point was the timing of the signal will be important. The purchaser will probably want to know that."
2015-10-28 12:43:18,"the russell day is once a year so not a good reference point :) That being said, yeah since everyone is expecting size its pretty easy to move around a lot of capital with not a lot of market impact. 

If at 3:59, you can't LOC a majority of issues anyway. They have to be marked regulatory, and you can only offset the original imbalance direction. So size is actually the least of his worries. "
2015-10-28 12:37:46,"Yes. It kind of depends on when OP gets his signal. If it's 3:59 that's a big problem. But if it's something way earlier the purchaser of this strategy will know that the issues that come up by scaling size are much more solvable when dealing with the closing auction than a strategy that hits into offers (or worse, gets passive fills) during the day. Heck, look at what happens on Russell days. The closing auction is well constructed for size."
2015-10-28 07:42:51,"Interesting, thanks"
2015-10-28 07:19:14,"the two largest factors I look at are avg p&amp;l per share and max drawdown. I need to know that you are profitable and covering costs easily and how long it takes you to get out of your typical hole. From there I'll look at capital utilization, sortino/sharpe etc"
2015-10-28 07:10:52,"i'd say closer to 15% nowadays. On blue chip names can be even higher. Honestly it depends on when they advertise the size, if you come in blasting 8m shares LOC and put the order in at 2pm, the specialist has over 2 hours to advertise and fill your order, pretty easy to do. 

You can do a boatload of size on the closing auction if you're smart about it. "
2015-10-28 07:05:35,"What do you think these numbers are currently? Particularly for OPs universe of stocks.

Fairly curious myself, even 10% seemed a lot for a small proportion of trading hours, although you do get that U shape for daily volumes typically."
2015-10-28 06:48:32,not accurate. those % have increased significantly. 
2015-10-28 04:42:46,"I don't know stocks and auctions well enough, but a quick google showed me less than 10% daily volume in closing auctions. No idea how accurate that is.

This means that if you do 1% of daily volume you are actually doing ~10% of closing volume, which is a lot. I think you're going to struggle to not affect the price at this level of volume, but I'm sure a decent fund has techniques to improve your execution. "
2015-10-28 04:27:51,"monstimal makes good points. Perhaps try comparing our returns to the returns of a dummy algo which does everything the same except it buys some random stocks each day, that would be a good comparison to show the power of your alpha I think.

Could you reverse your selection criteria to choose stocks to short? Even if you can't personally short the fund would be able to and so could scale your profitability that way, but also adding a hedge."
2015-10-27 23:38:40,I've read this book and I must admit I'm a little mystified by your enthusiasm. There doesn't seem to be anything in there which can't be found on the internet as such and his strategy development process is completely backward to my thinking. Can you expand on why you think this book is so good? 
2015-10-27 22:47:15,"thats a good point. i need to deliver the story more. The strategy is basically a buy the dip strategy on a micro scale. My secret sauce is actually secret dip that i define to signal a buy. 

I have recently started hedging by shorting SPY 100% and going long my picks 100%, of course i started this around SPY of 196 on the way down, felt like a hero, now not so much.

Hedging has not shown to be an advantage as of yet (and with the exception of 2008 none of my backtested years were negative. I don't want to sound cocky because i know the market has a way of reminding me of its power, but even if i were to take a 20% hit overnight on some fraud or something at a company, I am very quick to recover because 80% of the trades are winners. In q4 of 2013 I had a streak of 62 winning trades in a row. I also trade mostly mid,large cap companies that rarely have these drops. My largest drop was around 6% (SCTY...ugh)"
2015-10-27 22:06:19,"If you scale it big enough, your limit on close order **will** affect the closing price (and possibly move the price high enough to remove the trade from your system, hurting its performance). However, someone who buys the strategy can improve it to help with these issues that you haven't had to face. 

Is there any kind of theory behind your strategy? I really think it'd be nice if you came up with something...anything. Otherwise stuff like this seems like luck or curve fitting. The fact you have traded it live helps a lot and the fact you use the closing auction is great because that eliminates a lot of issues many have. But if I were a buyer I'd feel much better if there was a story, ""mutual funds and institutions are doing X, and here's how I think that creates an opportunity...."" (obviously without spilling your ""secret sauce""). 

Do you do any long-short balancing or hedging in this strategy on these overnight positions? If not, my first reaction is going to be that you've just made money over the past 2.5 years from the market going up. Be prepared to defend against that."
2015-10-27 21:16:58,"Yes 1% of total daily volume. i read somewhere that 3% or even 5% of the daily trading volume is doable, that seemed like a stretch to me so I assumed a 1% volume. I don't have volume at the close data, but  I could eventually trade right before the close if volume is too light at the close. 

All of the stocks I screen are either heavy volume or large price, or both. The price doesn't move at all when I buy because I use the Limit-on-Close. if it can't fill at the closing price, then it doesnt fill. I currently trade about 100k at the close with no issues in fills. 

It does work on all stocks regardless of the exchange (i only trade US though due to not knowing what the caveats of buying on other exchanges are), however, it is a very specific set of criteria I screen for, so if i were to trade an index or even a currency pair, I may get one or two trades in an entire year per item. It also does better when macro is less of a factor. 

Without external investment and maxing out my margin I could make about 40k unless i take some serious risks. That will compound over time, but i'd prefer a cash injection. Unless you know of a way to trade CFDs in the US ;) 

btw, thanks for your responses. they are helping me answer questions i didnt know i had. 


I have to get back to them tonight with a little data, so I am working on that now."
2015-10-27 19:23:19,"Hmm do you mean 1% of the traded volume in the whole day? Since you are trading the closing price you need to think about how much of the end of day volume you could be.

If you are trading in the closing auction then try making your size some percent of the typical volume traded in the auction (do you have that data?)

The amount you can trade might depend on whether you are typically choosing liquid or illiquid stocks to trade, and whether you tend to place the trades on high volume days or not.

The more volume you do the more you will affect the price, reducing your profit. Try looking at your average profit per trade in terms of price increments, the smaller that is the more you need to worry. 

I feel like 1.5m is quite small for a max scale strategy. Could it work on different markets? Suppose you are looking at us stocks now, would Europe be a possibility? That might provide some additional scale.

Back to value of the algo, what percent of the 1.5m do you think you could make without external investment? How much capital does the 1.5m need to trade? The percentage you could do alone is the amount you'd need to get in return for your algo to break even.

2015-10-27 15:10:56,"I have 25 years of backtested results and 2.75 years of live results. The only problem is that i have also traded outside the algo on the same account, so I couldn't just show my trade logs as proof (hopefully that isn't a problem down the line).


As far as the algo goes, the trading involves buying anywhere from 0-20 stocks at the close (usually 1-5), and holding for up to 5 days with an average hold of 2.42 days. 


For scaling estimation, I used (avg. vol * price) * 0.01 to represent 1% of the days volume in the trade as a maximum. Do you think that is fair? With this formula, I have come up with a maximum profit of $1.5MM/yr. This does not include any optimization for scale (because i haven't needed it). There are possibilities with buying options as well, but I don't know enough to use them.  


Here is a little chart I put together as part of the materials I am sending over.

If the backtest is very accurate, maybe show them that comparison along with pnl + stats over a longer horizon, if it were me I'd be interested. I'd say the more you can give them without giving away how it works the better. How confident are you it can scale to more capital?

On valuing it, I think its hard to come up with a market value. Can you find out / guess how much their guys / other funds would be compensated if they came up with this? That's going to be roughly what they'd be happy to give you I assume. Can you tell us roughly the order of magnitude of the returns of this algo, its sharpe and how much capital you think it can take?

2016-01-23 15:01:20,"The Spectral test, also know as the Discrete Fourier Transform test, is a well known test for randomness. When I applied this test to some well known stock market indices the test passed meaning that the test was not able to find any statistically significant patterns in the frequency dimension using the Discrete Fourier Transform. 

That said, if you have a particular data set in mind and it contains individual assets and possibly not stock market indices, then an ""easy"" way to forecast whether or not your analysis will yield any statistically or economically significant patterns might be to apply the test to your data and see if it passes or fails ... and then take it from there.

I'm not saying you can improve the accuracy of stock market forecasts using Fourier analysis, but unlike some others on this thread I am not saying you can't. Every great invention and scientific discovery probably looked like a waste of time before it wasn't. And P.S. Renaissance Technology hired a lot of ex signal processing guys. So who knows?"

When do these things work great? When the signal is composed of ""harmonic"" content mixed together, i.e. things that [look like this](http://gget.it/hdbcczjg/13.jpg) (this is the audio signal of a Piano). 

The rough idea is: if you want Fourier to work well, the signal has to be a bit ""periodic"", at least during a short period of time, like in the screenshot before.

Even if there are some ""waves"" in the trading signals, during my tests, I didn't see such ""periodic"" thing, and my attempts to do something useful with Fourier on trading have always failed, up to now. I don't think it can work.

Anybody in the 'trader education' space sets my bullshit meter twitching for reasons which should be obvious. Listening to interviews with him and reading between the lines, I suspect he wasn't close to the money at Goldman as the stuff he talks about is pretty much internet-quant 101. On the other hand, I don't know the guy, maybe he's awesome behind closed doors and he just likes to project this underwhelming public persona :)

Regarding the Excel, each to his own. The profit curve of that particular strategy looks like long/medium term RTM (I.E. like in his books), short term RTM will spike during the volatility, longer term will, as you say, take a hit."

2016-01-22 02:52:57,"In the end you will just have to see it as part of the cost of doing business. Most freelancers/self-employed people put the appropriate amount of money on a seperate bank account until it's time to pay taxes. (At least here in Germany, where you pay taxes yearly, if you are self-employed.) 

The direct impact it has on your strategies is that they have a higher bar for profitability than just having an expected vlaue higher than 0. Trading costs' (slippage, commission, taxes...) effect is that you need to ""beat the market"" quite significantly to make profits in the long run. Many people like to scale out of a trade for added safety, e.g. they take off yome of their position when they break even on the trade so that they can at worst end up with +-0. But they don't figure in taxes (or outsized losses due to freak events like gaps past stops) and don't realize that they are setting themselves up for bleeding their account dry slowly. 

I have argued in the past that it's quite unfair that you have to pay your losses in full, but the government takes a big chunk out of your wins. In no other business do they take away a big chunk of the capital you use to do your job. Though in practice only a few percent of traders are profitable over a year or more, so it really is a luxury problem only the few successful people have. 

Anyway, back to your question... The issue of having cash on hand solves itself through something you should be doing anyway: having cash reserves that you do not use for trading. Unforeseen things happen. As a trader you work hard to quantify your risk of ruin and keeping it as small as you dare while still making good profits. But it's still a real number above 0. When you start making significant consistent profits, you should take some of that and keep it as a reserve for bad times. Yes, you are going to miss out on some profits, think of it as insurance. What happens if you suddenly need to pay a massive medical bill? What happens if your broker goes bankrupt? Etc.etc. IMO that's part of risk management. You have to keep cash reserves or life *will* fuck you over. I have had to learn this the hard way myself and I know other people who ran into this as well. "
2016-01-22 02:31:46,Gotcha. Thanks for the reply man.
2016-01-21 23:02:46,Yes.
2016-01-21 22:37:55,"Practices vary widely for this based on the type of strategy and whatever your accountants/tax lawyers have to say about the most cost efficient way to do it. Of course you can write off business expenses and capital losses, so that's one of the big considerations. 

Keep in mind, most trading shops, or most businesses for that matter, hire people to figure out the details of this. No one is going to be able to tell you how to manage taxes without knowing exactly how your books and cash flows look. 

Tax code is an immensely complicated mess to deal with, and if you don't treat it as a secondary issue you'll drive yourself crazy. Focus on developing a winning strategy because the bottom line is once you're making money, you can sort out the taxes, especially with a little professional help. "
2016-01-21 22:16:37,"I put this in the same category as Fibonacci lines. We see what we want to see, so looking at a chart you might be tempted to say ""oh it's bouncing close enough to the Fibonacci level"" or ""looks like it roughly matches the Elliot wave pattern"". 

The reason these indicators are so prolific among retail traders is that it's easy to pull up any chart and have the pattern-recognition portion of your brain go into overdrive and see something that's not there, all while feeling like you're finally understanding the market. Try trading on these live and it will be a very different story.

2016-01-21 21:39:08,"One difference is that OU processes are mean reverting in the sense that mean and variance (conditioning on time s) tends to a finite value as you take the future time t to infinity.

On the other hand, Brownian motions have a finite mean, but variance tends to infinity!"
2016-01-21 21:19:59,"If you had a signal that was mean reverting and wanted to make a model that places trades based on it, wouldn't it be disconcerting if your model couldn't figure out how to trade [this](http://i.imgur.com/Uq6qScJ.png) plus a varying degree of random noise?

I'm not saying it's the one true way (or even that what the OP suggests is useful - I don't know), but I think it could make a useful diagnostic in other cases."
2016-01-21 20:40:19,"Thanks for the reply, but I think I mis-stated my post.  It's more along the lines of: how do you go about handling locking a portion of your gains each year so as to have cash for paying taxes. Is there any accepted practice for this, in an algorithmic sense?"
2016-01-21 20:32:10,"But the generated data is random - how can you draw any useful conclusion from it? If it works, it's coincidence. If it doesn't work, that doesn't mean anything either."
2016-01-21 20:30:05,"This is not surprising to me, and I fear you both may have misread my post.

What I meant was this: we must pay taxes on any realized gains.  We know this. Algo traders typically trade with enough frequency that it can be expected that, if you HAVE made gains, it is likely you have realized a significant portion of them within the year.

That being the case, are there any recommended practices for handling dispensation of profits in an ALGORITHMIC and tax efficient sense?  I don't see much discussion around it."
2016-01-21 20:23:11,"Thank you. You pretty much nailed what I was trying to ask.  I guess I didn't phrase it properly in the OP.

What I was meant was: in the admittedly small corner of research I've managed to pore through, I don't see many algo traders discussing the implications of taxes when all of your profits are tied up in your positions.  I don't know if there are recommended methods for handling it efficiently in an ALGORITHMIC sense."
2016-01-21 20:22:05,In general I think that testing strategies on generated data is a useful sanity check (i.e. I think a strategy that is meant to detect a certain inefficiency and act on it should behave well on ideal data as well as real data).
2016-01-21 19:52:07,"I don't understand - why would you test a strategy based on generated data when it won't be run on generated data in production? I know backtesting isn't perfect, but how is that not more realistic?"
2016-01-21 18:50:09,"Hum, not really, according to my tests. I may be wrong, but for example currency prices seem closer to Brown(ian) than pink. Pink noise has much more heavy discontinuities / more high frequency than currency prices.   
The same if you look the absolute total variation of the signal. Behaves more like a Brownian than a Pink.

Just for fun, here is : Audio-software-generated [White noise](http://gget.it/9dvvb9h1/white.mp3), [Brown(ian) noise](http://gget.it/py1uzpmi/brown.mp3), [Pink noise](http://gget.it/ghg0x5ny/pink.mp3), and rendering of [closeBid price of EUR/USD of some months ago](http://gget.it/c429etwv/eurusd.mp3) as a soundfile.

Something else: is Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process usually a better model than brownian motion for, say, currency prices? Why?

I'm currently looking at its stochastic diff equation, and trying to figure out what's the main difference with geometric brownian motion. Any clue?"
2016-01-21 17:30:07,"I think OP is asking how you pay taxes when your positions are still open. If you reinvest your entire profits from every winning trade, you won't have any cash to pay taxes or the bills for that matter. So yeah, if you don't have another significant source of income, you will always have to siphon off some of your profits.

2016-01-21 16:56:46,"RSI is just one way people try to meassure momentum. Or to be precise: RSI meassures the change in momentum. (And definitely *not* strength!) Many other indicators exist that do basically the same thing, e.g. the stochastic (which has nothing to do with stochastics) which is why they are often lumped together under the umbrella of ""momentum oscillators"", because they tend to oscillate (rapidly move between) two extremes. These extremes are commonly called ""overbought"" and ""oversold"", but that's BS with no statistical significance.

However using these oscillators to make momentum (or its rate of change) quantifiable does have a statistical edge when done correctly, because they can tell you something about what the other market participants are doing. E.g. observing ""divergence"", i.e. a new extreme in price failing to make a new extreme in momentum, is a statistically significant sign that momentum might be about to run out. 

Seasoned traders use tools like these to quantify the ""market context"". Different markets behave differently at different times. No strategy works across all of those context, at least not equally well. The main difficulty in long-term consistent profitability is knowing what kind of strategy to use in what market at what time. 

Now, I have a suspicion on why you asked, so let me point out that most candlestick patterns are pure BS with no statistical edge. Especially those that most people know. Head&amp;Shoulders pattern might kill aliens, but it has an exact 50% chance of predicting a trend change. However some do work in the right context. I have seen this myself and I know several highly successful traders who swear by specific patterns. The one common factor across all of them is that they have spend years working on only one market in one  timeframe or a low number of similar timeframes.

One tip I can give you from my own experience is that you shouldn't take candlestick patterns as a set combination of red and green boxes with a couple of lines around them that together form a symbol for you to learn by heart. Instead look at what price did *inside* the pattern. You will find that price really only moves in a few basic patterns (e.g. v-shaped trend change, lightning-shaped pullback that ends in a breakout/continuation, ranging between to price levels...) and all candlestick patterns are just variations on those. 

If you want to know more, The Art and Science of Technical Analysis by Adam Grimes is a great book for noobs. Adam has no qualms about slaying a whole herd of holy cows many traders mistakenly believe to be as concrete as the laws of physics. He also has a free video course on youtube, a blog and a podcast. He only asks for your email address and sends maybe one or two mails a month informing you of new blog posts. "

"
2016-01-21 06:06:08,"Markets repeatedly test price levels, back and forth, in different timeframes; not look for whether RSI is strong or weak.

RSI can be used in conjunction with concept with price levels. Also take a look at MACD bullish/bearish divergence (price made new high, MACD made second low and vice versa) around a price level."
2016-01-21 03:23:16,"It's simple really. RSI tracks whether something is making a (relatively) extreme move. Yet, that's precisely what happens when good/bad news drops.

Sure, eventually there will be a retracement period after the move is exhausted. But just because something moves quickly in one direction doesn't mean it will revert back to where it was.

Basically, sometimes an RSI value in the extreme ranges means normal fluctuations have hit their peak. But sometimes it means the underlying fundamentals have changed."

Prices take time to move between two points.  Bar news events and such, it usually takes an extended period of time for the price to move.  When trends break or change, there are some signals that can help foretell that occurrence.  

I think that Elliot waves are an attempt to generalize trends into predictable patterns.  It sometimes works, but should not be relied on as a tool to predict the future consistently.  "

2016-01-18 23:55:37,"If you focus on the *everything-done-in-python* bit I would argue you can't and you shouldn't stick to this mantra.  See below for why.

If you stress *open-source* I would say it's going to be difficult.  Bear in mind there's loads of proprietary SDKs/APIs out there.  Sometimes you'd have to sign an NDA to be filled in with details.  Sometimes they want to certify your code, or rather have it certified, before they turn they end of the API on.

People here make fun of you because you completely underestimated the sheer size of this endeavour.  You can try to be a jack of all trades but you wouldn't excel in any particular discipline, and there's still glue code needed to work with particular parties.

Just take trade execution as an example, depending on the company setup you might have to support drop-copy with custodians in several countries, maybe over different APIs, maybe over email or the phone.  You might need to respond to requests from your prime broker questioning you about your net-open positions, asking you to close some.  Region-specific stuff (MIFID II/MIFIR, ...), exchange specific things like the subtleties between limit and place limit orders, the various limit-if-... order types.
Whatever you think you dealt with in that hypothetical one-size-fits-all system I can assure you the very next real-money setup will blow that house of cards to smithereens.

I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying the system must be so ultra-flexible that I can easily replace any subset of it without it breaking.

2016-01-15 01:30:10,"I second the recommendation for QuantGo. My team has recently begun using it. Each data subscription (e.g. CME Full book, Equities NBBO, etc) costs around $300-400 and you are charged hourly for use (we racked up a $500~ bill in the last month). I think this is the cheapest way to have access to a lot of market data (renting) as opposed to buying data monthly (I was quoted $5,000-$10,000 per month for CME level 2 data) in order to do some preliminary research.

That being said, if you want free minute-level data, Quantopian would be the best choice given their platform's functionality."
2016-01-14 23:21:45,"[Cal Tech](http://quant.caltech.edu/historical-stock-data.html) has a page describing multiple data sources.  [Tickdata.com](https://www.tickdata.com/) is the general recommendation for this kind of stuff.  It will not be cheap -- all symbols are about 10k/year for minute bars.  I've heard of these guys and they're supposed to be good.  The CalTech page also recommends QuantQuote which looks like it's $9k for a complete minute bar package; I don't know much about QuantQuote though but I don't work with US equities and even if I did, I probably wouldn't need to use vendor data.

You may also want to consider [QuantGo](https://quantgo.com/)  Their model is different -- you don't buy data but instead, rent it on their (EC2, I believe) cloud and the rates are a lot more reasonable but you never own it and can't take it off their cloud.  It'll cost you $150 / month with a 4 month minimum commitment for minute bars plus per-hour usage fees for their cloud.

There are probably some non-professional services but I don't know about too many of them.  A couple of options you may consider include:

  * Quantopian.  They don't let you download the data either  but they have a system where you can work with it in python, both by writing and backtesting a strategy and in a IPython Notebook type system.  Their system is very slow -- getting a year's worth of data for one symbol takes tens of seconds -- so it's not that good for any real research but the price is right -- free.

  * Interactive brokers: If you have a funded account and pay some minimal fees, you have API access to their historical data.  I think that w/ equities, you can only go back for a year without spending a lot in commissions (you get more and more access as you spend more and more) and the API has a pretty severe rate limiter but again, the price is good."

As you have bar data you could take average of the four MA's or the midpoint of high-low or just take the close. 

The slope is just the ROC of the most N recent points. (think fitting a line through it).

N is your choice, when the slope process changes symbols you know it's an inflection point or when it goes to within some neighbourhood of zero and back.

I used no tolerance and set the neighbourhood to zero, simply when the slope crossed zero it would generate a flag.

2014-03-25 18:46:03,"First off, if you're a complete newb to trading then I highly suggest not getting involved in writing a complete trading application.  Developing a profitable strategy is tough so why waste time developing a complete trading platform?

You might check out [algo-trader](https://code.google.com/p/algo-trader/) (Java), but like many (every?) open-source trading software project before it, they eventually go commercial and the open-source version stagnates.  There is also open-source Python code from Quantopian that may help you get started.

If you want to write your own trading software for Linux then, as you stated, you're going to want to use the MBT Quote API for your data feed and the FIX gateway.  I couldn't tell you whether or not the free forex demo account has access to either one of these services.

But this is what I suggest.  Get your feet wet first.  Sign-up for the free MBT forex demo account, sign-up for a free Amazon EC2 instance, acquire NT free development license, and startup your EC2 instance, connect with Remote Desktop, install NT, and connect to MBT and play around."
2014-03-25 17:33:54,"Sorry, but your reply is all kinds of confusing.

NinjaTrader (NT) is trading software not a broker.  It is free for demo/paper/sim trading and development.  MB Trading provides free/live Forex demo accounts.  You can connect NT to this MBTrading demo account and receive live data and your strategies can paper/sim trade within the NT application.  It has an algorithm that simulates whether your orders would be filled or not.

Kinetick is a data-only feed provided by the NinjaTrader company for the NinjaTrader software ONLY.  They wanted to provide an economical, reliable, quality data feed for their customers because there is a demand and lack of options for this.  You can't use Kinetick with any other software besides NinjaTrader.  And I wouldn't bother paying extra for Kinetick when connecting to MB Tradings data feed is just fine.

Specifically referring to algotrading MBTrading provides their data feed via their MetaTrader software (available for download on their site), NinjaTrader (available from NinjaTrader.com), MBT Quote API (simple text protocol), and their MBT SDK (Microsoft COM).

You can also download historical data with MBTs web interface (after logging in), but it is very cumbersome.

**TL;DR** Acquire NT free development license, download NT, sign-up for an MB Trading free forex demo account, connect NT to MBT and receive live forex data and 14+ days historical data depending on tick/minute/day time interval.  More historical data is available elsewhere on the internet, some free, some charge for."

2014-03-25 17:11:04,Yeah I wasn't real thrilled about the fees.  Do you know if other brokers have fees liek that as well?
2014-03-25 17:10:33,"I was planning on having my algo use Kinetick to produce signals and then I would send orders using MBT's FIX gateway

But you're saying MB Trading has one of the best broker based data feeds?  I wasn't even aware they provided real tick data.  Do they have a streaming API or something?  I didn't see anything on their website.

I guess if NT has a pay for limits plan then thats a possibility too.  Does NT allow you to write your algos in any language or do you have to use their ninjascript or whatever its called?"

[CME's iLink2.0 documentation](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/iLink+Order+Entry) does have some nice graphs about how some of the FIX internals work (logon, heartbeat, resend requests etc). (check out, for example, the sessionlayer/resendrequest page). Keep in mind though that a lot of exchanges add some extensions to the protocol, mostly extra fields but sometimes some protocol extensions as well.

As for ""how is a fix message constructed, how does a session look like in reality"" i would just try to set up a connection using some opensource/free Application (QuickFix did have something like that, i think, but there are probably thousands) and Gateway (http://fiximulator.org/ maybe?) and then just use a network sniffer (wireshark for example) to look at the raw messages/message exchanges."

2014-03-05 15:25:40,"&gt;The authors say ""HFT cannot be un-invented or regulated away."" Bullshit.

The authors were not implying that HFT cannot be regulated, they are saying that you cannot undo the paradigm shift in thinking that is behind much of HFT. 

&gt;The authors accept without question that HFT ""adds liquidity"" to the market, but this assertion is not supported and is likely false. 

Most authors/mainstream academics/institutional market participants accept the idea that HFT adds liquidity as true, there is more evidence in support of this thinking than against it, despite what you read daily on nanex.

&gt; If HFT doesn't add liquidity, then virtually all of it is merely predatory trading that adds volume and churn without aiding price discovery in the slightest.

Thats a poor assumption, false logical implication and false conclusion. 0/3.

2014-03-03 17:31:19,"The main point is that HF trading operates on a different paradigm than us humans. (Wow, what a blinding insight.) 

I strongly disagree with a number of points and conclusions. The one conclusion I agree with is that LF traders should stop thinking in terms of ""time"" and think instead in terms of ""volume"".

But back to my complaints.

The authors say ""HFT cannot be un-invented or regulated away."" Bullshit. It can certainly be regulated. The authors accept without question that HFT ""adds liquidity"" to the market, but this assertion is not supported and is likely false. If HFT doesn't add liquidity, then virtually all of it is merely predatory trading that adds volume and churn without aiding price discovery in the slightest.

Parts of the paper read like an academic's view of the markets. IOW, like it was written by a student with no real-world trading experience. 

One valuable take-away is that a disproportionate percentage of all trades occur in the first second of every hour, and that a disproportionate number of trades are executed in round-number lots. Both of these are tip-offs that a human, (AKA a low-frequency trader), is at work."

2014-03-03 11:41:17,"&gt;How are you connecting Python to IB, via the Java or C++ connectors?)

I am wrapping IbPy, which wraps the Java API. I forked IbPy, added a class that overloads the EWrapper methods, and implements callbacks who when hit store their data in a dict like class. I also added a client class where the requests are made, and the goal is to improve the ease in making these requests. Each method in the client class returns a reference id, such that when keyed against the respective dict like object, you can obtain the requested result. 

Then on the aleph side, the broker module inherits from the client class and implements methods more specific to that library. For instance, I am working on passing a aleph/zipline order to the broker module and having it infer the ib order details. This is meant to prevent additional code in moving to live execution. Ultimately, my goal is to have a live datasource and an additional kwarg (live_execution=True) when instantiating your algo class to be the only difference between a live and backtesting environment.

&gt;How are you going to run the OMS?

This is the current task I am facing, and unfortunately I am still at the drawing board. I see three options:


When your_algo.order is called and live execution is set to true, that order object is passed to the broker module which infers the full order details and is then sent to IB

1. Here I could link the ib order with the aleph order by assigning the aleph order id to the ib reference id and then on each iteration, synchronize the aleph fields to match the updated ib order status. 

2. I could create an alternative blotter class to use in the live environment where orders are actually the ib orders instead of simulation values that are reconciled to reality. 

3. I could completely forget about syncing orders, and instead just up the frequency in which I reconcile my positions and account data. However this would obviously have negative impacts, especially regarding accurate details on slippage, fills and transaction costs.

I am sure there are many more alternatives, these are what come to mind. I am thinking 2 is the correct way to do this, though I think it will be more difficult and riddled with more road blocks along the way. I am definitely open to suggestions as well.

 
&gt; Aside from the fact I hate scroll down websites with a passion.

I am kinda bummed you didn't like my project page, it was my first foray into web development and I was fairly proud of it having only spent 2-3hrs on it."

2014-02-28 14:48:28,"This is early in development, but it now allows you to use a Futures DataFrame source, although the futures performance tracker is still under development. As far as Live execution goes, by instantiating your algorithm with live_execution = True, the platform will initialize your strategy with your portfolio loaded from IB (requires you have TWS or Gateway open with sockets enabled). The platform uses individual futures contracts rather than continuous synthetic time series, allowing you to programmatically define your front month and how to roll over using the @roll decorator on handle_data (currently has a bug plaguing it)  Next I am going to work on implementing sending orders off to IB and periodically reconciling values between the two.

[EDIT] Basic Live execution is functioning (stocks and market orders so far)! For the love of god test in either a paper or demo account. I havent used outside of the FA platform either, so minor modifications might be necessary. "

2014-06-27 13:39:23,need help?
2014-06-27 01:41:39,"1. Generally, commissions are the same.  However, some discount brokers are pretty cheap for starters (interactive brokers mainly)

2. I'd say Python/R to start off.  Until you're hitting the heavy computation area, you likely won't need to spend time doing Java/C++.  C++ especially takes a very long time to code up, and the amount of time you spend on it can be spend on making a better strategy/optimizing it.

3. You're thinking about it the wrong way.  You probably shouldn't explicitly decide to trade every minute or so.  You should think of it as trading on triggers or ""events"".  This can be different things ranging from OnNews to OnTick to OnBar (range of time).  On each event, you could set up a condition to send to the execution handler for performing the trade.  As for the range, it all depends on your data and strategy.  Liquidity-based strategies tend to rely much more on time while fundamental/news-based strategies are slightly slower and less sensitive to time.

4.  If you can't do IB, try TradeKing or OptionsHouse.  Both offer great deals, and OptionsHouse has an excellent virtual currency you can test with.  It also has amazing options rates.  It does not support fixed income or FX though.  So TradeKing's the better bet for FI/FX.

5.  Quantopian is a start in discussing strategies.  However, I do not recommend you use it as your main and only source.  There's three quick tips for you in backtesting:

- Know what survivor and lookahead bias are and make sure you don't get caught in it
- Don't overfit your data; keep your in-sample away from out-of-sample.  If you're just starting, I would keep strict rules in that once a sample has been used as out-of-sample, it's no longer valid to be used in the algorithm.
- Sanitize your data and always prepare some type of killswitch; the markets are unpredictable"
2014-06-24 22:53:12,"Yeah GPU is something I'd definitely like to explore. Not too familiar with CUDA but it'll be on the list of considerations to make down the road.

2014-06-24 22:51:00,"Thanks for the recommendation -- I just watched the talk. Great information on system design, just what I was looking for. I'm equally glad to see they've opensourced the disruptor as well."
2014-06-24 21:05:50,"If you're interested in the system more, I would highly recommend diving into the networking world and GPU world as well.  Both are very interesting areas to look into that expand upon many evolving HFT algorithms.

2014-06-24 11:11:04,"[This talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX) might be of interest if you're not already familiar with the disruptor pattern. Martin Thompson's blog [Mechanical Sympathy](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.no/) also has a lot of performance related material.

Why specifically HFT? Any system has to make concessions, HFT ones too."
2014-06-23 22:28:53,"Thanks! I've actually heard Algorithmic Trading and DMA referenced often for a couple years now, when I was first introduced to the concept. I'll pick it up.

Yeah low-latency HFT is the goal above all else. I'm really not interested in the physical trading half as much as I am the concept of making a competitively fast unrestricted system. It's also a further impetus for me to actually get involved in learning the Linux kernel since I've been half-assing it since graduation. But as you and others said, understanding the landscape is going to be important before getting too involved in this.

I agree that C++ seems like the best option. I was hoping plain C would be sufficient, but I'm assuming the libraries and API interfaces aren't going to exist, or comply as easily as C++ will."
2014-06-23 21:55:58,"How does DMA work with your broker? Is it through a broker?

How do you keep track of your trades for when it's tax time?"
2014-06-23 20:56:00,"My main role right now is actually building a trading platform from C++. My biggest advice to you is to know what your goals are. If you're looking to do ultra-low latency HFT, you're very likely going to be pressed on C++. Otherwise, Java may be ok. If I were to recommend one book to read, it would be [Algorithmic Trading and DMA](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Trading-DMA-introduction-strategies/dp/0956399207). That book goes from the very beginning of the process to the end. It even gives you a little bit of information about market microstructure.
As for APIs, methods, libraries, and all. I recommend staying as portable as possible. This means in the C++ world to try your best to stick with Boost/STL. Plan out your design and don't just wing it. You will highly regret it. The way our platform works is we have a core component set with adapters/wrappers for the core. This way, whenever a new update comes to one of our data feeds or execution handlers, we're able to get everything running without redesigning the system.
I know I haven't answered everything you asked, but I think the most important part's to get a foundation. The rest of your questions will be answered once you start it up. Grab that book from above and read it. Then once you have a grasp, take a look at the different order types that are available on different exchanges and start working with different broker APIs.

Edit: I lied.  A few other libraries worth mentioning includes quantlib.  But for the most part, try and keep your core segregated.  You'll know what I mean when you get caught in a third-party mess.  If you're using a version control system (which you should), learn to use externals really well."

2014-06-23 12:19:32,"Yeah there was a lot of testing, the system is about 3 years old so it's pretty well tested.  Yep my servers are located in Chicago, I run market making strategies, some of which are mostly automated and others that require action when they trade.  I control the execution platform on my chicago server from my local machine."
2014-06-23 12:08:44,"Understandable, thanks a lot for the info. That price range isnt as terrible as id imagine. I'm guessing you did a ton of testing before committing to DMA though. Are you located in NYC/Chicago (wherever the exchanges are you use)? How much involvement and oversight do you take while trading? Im just wondering if even having colocated servers would be mitigated by being geographically far  from the server itself if intervention is necessary clientside. Forgive me if im prying or asking the obvious.  Any info is appreciated."
2014-06-23 11:48:13,"Order confirmation from the exchange is very fast compared to what it use to be 5/6 years ago, it's only about 1 or 2 milliseconds, sometimes there will be spikes of about 10 milliseconds during periods of high volatility (economic reports, etc).  DMA adds complexity in that I have to write to each exchange individually (order entry, and market data parsing) as opposed to using a service like TT's API which aggregates every exchange they suppport under one FIX spec.  I only use 2 exchanges...so it's not too hard for me to support, unless I want to expand.  There are colocation providers out there that will host servers  in the 1-3k per month range, depending on how many exchanges it requires connectivity to.  I won't say exactly what I pay but it's in that range."
2014-06-23 11:16:51,"I think once you get deep into that level people find FIX comes with its own little quirks that makes it almost equal to using various APIs anyway. And that is only one side (sending orders, the easier side) of interacting with the broker. The more difficult and important part will be dealing with market data, crash handling, and many other things. The difference between sending a FIX message and whatever message the broker's API wants is trivial. 
"
2014-06-23 10:58:11,"No worries,  I appreciate the advice. I read the intro to the paper and was pretty intrigued so I'll likely read it later since it seems like a good stepping stone as you pointed out. "
2014-06-23 10:56:38,"Some APIs are just on top of the web based front end the broker uses. Some APIs are more direct, it sounds like you want one of those. For example, (and I don't trade with these guys so this isn't a recommendation) Lightspeed has a front end API one can use that you can find info for [here](http://www.lightspeed.com/trading-platforms/lightspeed-trader/). But you probably want something like [this](http://www.lightspeedinstitutional.com/automated-trading/lightspeed-gateway/) product.

Other options: [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041), [Lime](http://limebrokerage.com/), etc. Personally I think it'd be very difficult to start on your system without looking into the API first, which means choosing a broker, but maybe you can do it."
2014-06-23 10:41:09,"I use Linux/C++/boost, and Quickfix to do some of the session management.  I have DMA access to exchanges so I just use their FIX API to place orders."
2014-06-23 10:11:40,"You're right, I must have glossed over that part. To me the question ""How do I build a good trading platform?"" is highly dependent on what strategies you're trying to use so I kind of linked the two without saying so. Might also be very much my own thinking reflected as well.

Anyway, I still think the Max Dama paper has a lot to offer even if you're not interested in strategies."
2014-06-23 09:25:55,"He specifically said he doesn't want to do that. He even wrote ""specifically"" right where he said it.

&gt; Specifically, I'm not interested so much in developing actual strategies themselves

~~I also disagree with some people saying you should integrate with a broker first or start learning some open-source platform.~~

The first thing to do, IMO, is to get a hold of data and start exploring that data and trying to find a pattern that might constitute a strategy.

You can try implementing known strategies from papers you can find online and when you have a solid idea of what goes into a strategy you will have a pretty solid idea what you will need from your trading platform.

Strategy first, platform and infrastructure second.

Edit: As pointed out, you might not be interested in strategies, I would still argue though that you should pick _some_ strategy as a starting point and start developing the platform around that, it will let you see what the needs are and allows for greater experimentation."

2014-06-22 21:43:23,"The problem is drawing the trendline in the first place. What is easy for a human is not so easy for a computer. First you need to draw the trendline itself, but that requires you to identify a ""lowest low"" or ""highest high"" to extrapolate from. More than likely you'd draw a ""trending zone"", but one single over-penetrating bounce would make that zone incredibly wide.

Even after you have your line you need to have a strict definition of what it means to bounce off of it. Again, it would be more of a zone, which you've talked about, but it's all quite a bit tougher than it seems to make sure you pick up signal and not noise from your trading system.

You'd also need to make sure your security is actually trending."

In the Orders window, I added a new Trade name to an unassigned order.  Then I selected the closing order and selected the Trade name from the menu.

I then switched to the Trades window, left clicked on the new Trade and assigned a Strategy to it, then clicked the Open checkbox, then right-clicked the Trade to Set Tags.  Once I selected the first Tag, that's when the program crashed.

I've uploaded a screencast of the steps to [Youtube here](http://youtu.be/lz_H0uHl9ZM?hd=1).

It seems like if I switch back to the Orders window before setting tags, it does not crash.

"
2014-06-10 12:27:57,Sweet.  Now all I need to do is to figure out how to use it.
2014-06-08 17:27:09,TD transaction cost are absurd. IB is a no brainer for what you said. 
2014-06-06 11:49:30,"I'm very behind on most of my contributions to open source projects, so I feel you there."
2014-06-06 10:35:25,"So, your interaction with an exchange usually has two components. The first is what are generally static costs. These include membership, infrastructure, and access fees (order entry ports, market data feeds, colocation, network handoffs, etc). These are very predictable and can be managed by using different services to reach the exchange (such as using a DMA service).

The variable cost, in the form of the transaction fees, can be challenging to predict but that is more an issue with the specific pricing model of the exchange (because as you go up in tiers the pricing is not always retroactive). Order types like ""post-only"" (which is particularly popular in US Equity trading) essentially guarantee (depending on the market) you will never be the taker. Where it tends to become a bit more challenging is the tiering in pricing structure. Many markets will positively change your pricing the more trades you do, or the more you quote at the inside or set a new inside of the market (there are a few variations to this model).

The fees are intended to offset the cost of adverse selection, especially in the case of market makers. By paying a small amount per transaction the net cost of being picked off is reduced over the course of a day or month. The tiers also sometimes impact how much a firm may pay to take from the market, making it less costly.

Most M/T fees are by fraction of a currency (in the US, for equities, it's usually in the ballpark of 0.002X per share traded for a rebate, and 0.003X per share fee for takers).

If you are trading in a market without post-only order types you will have to predict how often you execute due to being late into the market (ie - you ship an order intended to make in but hit someone who is already at that price level on the other side of the market). I can't speak to the models (apologies, I'm more of a market structure guy) but someone here might be able to tell you what to look at."

2014-06-05 12:15:07,"These costs are small enough not to worry too much about them. It was simply a small sub-cent tax on 'edge'. 

One time a question popped up - is it worth to sell an option at 0.01 (after all the fees), and the answer was (in some situations its okay to do this). "
2014-06-05 12:08:18,"What do your transaction fees on IB end up looking like? I'll take a look at algotrader. If nothing else, I might be able to steal some algorithms from them for the program I'm working on in R now."

2014-06-05 09:20:45,"Thanks for your reply.  
For the question 1, I think I didn't explain clearly. I mean, after you finish the backtesting and are ready to run the robot ""live"", where do you put the robot? A VPS or your own computer? Or your robot uses GA for not only backtesting/optimizing but also live trading?"
2014-06-05 07:20:55,"1. I have my own 6-core machine to do my work.  Since I'm doing some GA work, I have a lot of parallel code.  VPSs don't give me enough power to do what I want, and I don't like MT4/MT5.  Personal preference.

2. Oanda has a history system that retrieves up to 5000 candles of history.  Depending on the broker, that's significantly more (or potentially less) than you can get from the history of MT.  I've had cases with MT4 where I could only get the last 2 weeks of data for H1 for NZD/USD, which was unacceptable to put it mildly."
2014-06-04 23:51:03,"I only use C++ because of the performance.  
For backtesting/optimizing, performance is the killer.  
I had written a backtesting system in Perl then I gave it up because the performance is not acceptable."
2014-06-04 23:49:03,"Thanks for your post and sorry for my so late comment.  

I also have much interesting in Oanda API.  
My questions:  
1, You use your own computer to run the robot, or rent a VPS? There are dedicated MT4 VPS, but I'm not sure if we have trouble to rent a VPS for our own robot, such as a robot written in C++ (I use C++).  
2, You have to maintain the database of historical bar data downloaded from Oanda? With MT4, MT4 does it for you.

As a side note, what you're talking about doesn't sound particularly time sensitive to me (I could be wrong here or there's more to your project) and it might make sense for you to start in a higher level language like Python, R, or (as a last resort) Matlab over C++"
2014-05-21 00:50:17,"I write financial applications, sometimes including algos, and often in C++.  some of the other answers here are correct, you should definitely have a year or two of the language under your belt before you get into finance. 

 there are a lot of special rules, like use decimal types not floating point (or double), shared pointers are pretty good practice over raw pointers, etc.

If you want to get started, look at the [QuickFIX](http://www.quickfixengine.org/) project.  FIX is a standard interface for trading, and QuickFIX has a number of implementations in C++, java, C#, etc."
2014-05-20 21:17:03,I disagree. You need to have some *very* high performance targets before the complexity of programming in C++ is outweighed. You also need a relatively skilled developer to actually get those performance benefits.

I use python for the majority of my programming since it's very expressible and can be used to do essentially anything. Would you say it's easy to write those things after diving into a functional language? Or is it still somewhat awkward to use for those tasks?"

2014-05-20 09:23:55,"&gt; A few months of C++ likely is not going to get you very far in terms of algorithmic trading. I'd recommend a higher level language to start with

I completely agree. I'd also like to point out that the other ""conservative"" choices, Java and C#, aren't significantly more powerful than C++. IMO you should be looking at functional languages. Here's [some feedback from happy F# users](http://fsharp.org/testimonials/), many with lots of C++ experience.

F# isn't my personal choice as I prefer to stay off of .NET and don't like the multiparadigm aspects of F#, Ocaml and Scala, but those testimonials are great for showing the strength of functional programming."
2014-05-20 08:33:28,"In my experience, C++ is much better suited towards someone who has experience in the field and is designing algorithms which focus on speed. A few months of C++ likely is not going to get you very far in terms of algorithmic trading. I'd recommend a higher level language to start with, and then once you're comfortable with the concepts moving on to something like C++ if speed is really imperative or there are specific libraries you want to use which are available only in that language.

A lot of combined resources either suck in the finance or programming side, so you either know that the code sucks, or you are confused into thinking the finance topic is being treated adequately when it probably isn't.

All of the financial modeling in C++ books that I've come across are outdated, finance or C++-wise, or are thinly veiled intros to one or both topic, which isn't worth the entry fee."

2014-05-16 20:50:05,"You will probably hear 10 different responses from 10 top hedge fund/portfolio managers.  It's a lot on your own analysis.  There have been many times where the best have been wrong.

The main thing is to know what you want to risk, and try your best to keep in control of it.  Once you lose track of your risk is when you start getting hurt.  My **personal** opinion is ""it depends.""  Frequent traders/professional traders will have varying opinions of timing the market.  I think that an infrequent, casual trader should, indeed, try and time the market.  There's been statistical evidence that, in overall, the market is cyclical and upwards trending.  This means that at the times of significant bear markets (roughly 60 or so months I think), markets cycle.  If you do not have the experience or the strategies (or really time in the end), then timing and longing equities/protective put+longs in a bottom market is almost always a safe bet.  Take 6+ low-correlated/off-sector large caps and long them on a bottom market (or just &gt;25% drawdown at least), and you will most probably outperform casual short-term traders in the long run.

However, if you do not plan on waiting tons of time (up to years) to trade, then don't worry about the timing of the market.  I'm just saying that for example, if you purchased almost ANY diversified portfolio in 2000, 2008, or 2011 at the bottom market (doesn't even have to be close to the bottom) and waited a year or so and sell, you would have spend significantly less time worrying about your investment account and enjoyed around 30% or so a year of profits.

Again, just my opinions.  I'm not a financial adviser at all, so I'm just trying to provide another view.  My work is mostly in low-latency trading, so it's not quite the same."
2014-05-16 20:42:04,"And you're absolutely right.  It's definitely possible for the strategy to work towards removing oversold/overbought instruments.  The trick is to really watch out for what it's doing.  I'm basically trying to play devil's advocate here to give a second view/possibility of the algorithm.  Every algorithm's got a weakness, which is why most algo traders will hold tons of different algorithms (to control correlation/market response).

A strategy like this a very reasonable one.  It's a very commonly mentioned one for educational purposes as well.  However, it does have possibly severe weaknesses (as described)."

2017-11-09 04:55:08,"Testing you can do to avoid/discover curve-fitting:

Monkeytest - (remove your whole exit strategy and just use ""Exit after random amount of bars"" and change random amount between 10-100 and see what happens.

Walk forward - Optimize and check.. You want as many periods in the walk forward as you can get, and you to have aprox. 70% in sample and 30% out of sample.

Monte carlo - Take all the ""out of sample"" trades from the walk forward and randomize the order they come in. I like doing 5000 monte carlo randomizing tests. (There are free softwares out there..)

Also tiny reply to @dysregulation: If you KNOW an index is going to go up 20% in 1 year, you would sell your apartment and everything you own to just buy and hold for 1 year... but you dont know, do you? Thats why you want systems that get that stable good 15-20% returns or whatever... if you can get that, just double the amount of shares/contracts and get that stable 30%-40% return ;) "

2017-11-08 09:30:54,"Quantopian has become a training site enabling newcomers to learn basic trading strategies in Python, like pairs trading, mean reversion testing and trading, momentum testing and trading, and of course procedures for backtesting and, more important, the means to experiment with backtesting.

When I get an email from a student asking me where they might get started I inevitably send them to Quantopian, tell them to join, tell them to systematically review all of the videos and look at most of the notebooks. They get free data access, the pipeline, all that.

This happened yesterday, in fact.

I also warn them that many of the models are very basic and un-nuanced and not likely to lead to trading profits. Of course Quantopian recognizes this and urges them to explore and develop more and go past the video examples. But from my experience if a budding trader uncovers an algo that has any chance of showing returns, they go proprietary (which does not really take all that much money for certain strategies).

2018-01-26 08:47:12,"yep. What used to cost $5m to setup, you can have for $29/mth.
BYO strategy and logic, possibly dont need a data scientist, but useful skills to have probably essential for quant finance (basic level stat/maths understanding maybe calculus).
Finance degree / macro is possibly the most important ""factor"" you can add to a trading system.

I use macro filters to help identify when the market will be range trading or trending.
Tip - correlation with the S&amp;P and its EPS(TTM) has been over 0.9 since 1850, has broken down over the last 20 years but consistent throughout history on average.

Volatility / Risk Parity is another institutional investment strategy worth some investigation, however this is a very crowded trade right now so caution is warranted.

Have a look at PMI and/or IP too they are useful.

- which trading platform goes best with python?
- which IDE?
- Python advantageous? 
Atm too difficult for me: neural networks, quantopian, advanced math. 

What other advantageous over MQL4? (faster backtesting? better optimizing?)

2018-01-26 07:16:50,"There isn't a way to predict the future prices by looking at the past prices. Only thing I'd try is AI because it might develop a strategy beyond human capability. 

Abritrage works. Buy and hold works. Programming things for other people works. Trading macd and rsi doesn't. "
2018-01-26 06:28:47,"I haven’t read everyone else’s comments but I noticed someone saying indicators are useless which isn’t remotely true. Indicators are just one piece of it, position sizing and expectancy are arguably more important. I.e. how much you stake relative to your capital, when and the expected return.

That may sound obvious but it’s most over looked. 

Whether anyone likes it or not, trends happen in markets. US Equities are an obvious example and also one where fundamentals are frequently ignored by the market.

Try looking at longer time frames purely to identify trends. E.g. weekly, fairly easy to spot. 

You should define your position size in the context of your capital, that way you can aggressively reduce your position size if you start going below your chosen threshold and conversely if the strategy performs consistently you can improve it. You can also add volatility filters if you want to avoid or reduce exposure in certain conditions.

Then you can use more granular time frames and indicators to set stops/limits and time entry and exits.

You can still have a very profitable strategy that is right less than 50% of the time, it’s a question of how much you stake on winning trades and how quickly you cut your losses.

2018-01-26 05:49:08,Seems like you're extremely interested in algo trading and can code. Get a job in a hedge fund quant business. Great way to learn.
2018-01-26 05:32:35,Building your own teaches you many things even if you finally go for something else. See the thread which is also live right now: https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/7surwp/building_automated_trading_system_from_scratch/
2018-01-26 04:33:27,"Excellent advice here
"
2018-01-26 02:50:10,Did they have better returns or only better after risk adjustment?
2018-01-26 02:18:33,"What kind of strategies are you trying? Is it possible that you have it backwards? The indicators are what you do last, not first. Algo trading is like a science experiment. You come up with a hypothesis, and then you use the appropriate tools to design the experiment and tools. When you start with indicators, it's like ""let's see what happens when I mix these two chemicals together"". A proper hypothesis would be like ""acid can be neutralized by adding a base"". Then, you proceed to mix acid with different bases to see what works best and in what amounts. Your hypothesis should come from something a sensical prediction rooted in something fundamental.

An example hypothesis would be ""Companies with higher debt will underperform companies with lower debt during periods of interest rate increases"". The hypothesis may stem from the fact that companies with higher debt may have more difficulty refinancing in times of increasing interest rates.

Then, you can proceed to gather your data on various interest rates, and time series of debts of different companies. You can then test this hypothesis by shorting high debt companies and going long low debt companies during periods of increasing interest rates.

This is finally where you may start using some indicators. Maybe you might define ""increasing interest rates"" in terms of 2 SMA's. During this time you will define your parameters and make attempts to optimize. If you see some alpha, then it's a sign to keep going. If you are unable to find alpha, you might have to reject your hypothesis. You may need to modify or narrow your hypothesis and retest. For example, restrict it to companies within the same sector.

I hope this helps and I hope it gives you some encouragement. I guarantee you that there is alpha available. I have an automated system running off daily bars and I've found a few strategies that make money during live trading. I've found a few more where the model has alpha, but the spreads and transaction costs are too wide. The money and safety comes in when you've got a couple of non correlated strategies running at the same time, each running on a smaller portion of your capital.

I don't understand most of the indicators that you named and I can't figure out what they're supposed to do. I have some moving averages and standard deviations in my algos. I don't think throwing together a formula and giving it a name will make it useful. I can kind of see how two moving averages can show a change indirection. Mathematically, you're detecting a change in curvature by calculating the change in slope of a curve. Some of the other stuff don't seem to make any sense. Keep it simple. If you don't understand why the indicator is explained by math, don't use it."
2018-01-26 00:08:38,The shorter the time frame the harder predicting the market becomes. If you're working on tick data you might as well look for patterns in order flow. ML is where it's at.
2018-01-26 00:03:10,Indicators and their delta give great context. I know a guy that wrote his forex bots in tradestation to strictly trade by the greeks and he makes bank selling options.

2018-01-25 23:48:03,"It seems really nice. I'm assuming it's worth the $29/month for live trading then? Also, it's basically a one-stop shop for everything you need for algo trading right?"
2018-01-25 23:23:19,"I think you got the order opposite. Forget about the data and your automation for a second, figure out a strategy that works in the long run. I can't believe that everything you've tested didn't give a profit. Here's a very simple strategy - you buy and hold for the past 5 years and your asset double...

What I'm saying is that if you don't have a strategy but hope to fit the data to a ""model"" and hope that works, it's not gonna work."

2018-01-25 22:37:59,DD stands for due diligence. Yes infrastructure doesn't help when your strategy is garbage. You mentioned Matlab in erny chans book. I have partially read the book.

2018-01-25 21:59:45,"Yea, I've tested my backtesting engine extensively. But most of my problem seems to be not being able to identify regimes. The mean reverting ones get terribly run over, or the trend following ones get chopped up.

At this point I wouldn't mind overfitted results just to see some positive results."

2018-01-25 21:56:49,That's kind of how I got started. I actually think I have two halfway decent ideas. But they only work when the market is mean reverting... unfortunately I can only identify that in hindsight.

2018-01-25 21:54:15,"I wouldn't trust any strategy posted online. Even if it was legit (ie not an overfit) when originally posted, it doesn't take much to hit capacity/get arbitraged away. Same goes with classic technical indicators. Nobody is leaving free money on the table.

Do you manually trade futures? You might discover something to exploit while doing it. My most promising stock algos came from observations I made while trading. 

Have you tried any mean reversion strategies? I've seen examples that seem to check out, contrary to what I said earlier. 

Have you tried to correlate prices to some sort of alternative data set?

2018-01-25 21:38:46,"The indicators you listed are lagging indicators.  I’d suggest bringing in a leading indicator-volume comes to mind....

In your backtesting, did you notice your algo getting hot? Getting cold?    

Do your algos know if it’s hot or cold?   Can they take them selves off line when they’re getting cold.   Can they call in another algo that may be better suited?

Can your algos recognize support/resistance?    Not just pivots but points of control, tails? 

I had a good time programming bots - it was when they needed eyes to see was when I threw towel.   

Good luck!"
2018-01-25 21:38:23,"An IDE is in many cases a glorified name for the combination of a shell and text editor. Take Emacs (which predates all modern IDEs) and you have the ultimate IDE (really)

Some IDEs get even in the way. Take IPython, Spyder and the like, which offer a nice IDE but break `multiprocessing` under Windows because they hijack the Python process (to offer an integrated experience, which for most people is a lot better than not being able to properly use the `multiprocessing` module)

What QuantConnect (et al.) offers you is the backtesting in the *cloud* with no need for you to set up anything. Some people will argue that there is a chance they look into the details of your strategy ... but Quantopian had the same model, was successful and there were no known complaints (and neither of the others have known complaints about stolen IP)

As you may imagine I would vouch for `backtrader`, but at the end of the day is a decision which has to weight in several factors: API, data feeds, infrastructure, ... and that decision can only be made by you after some proper research."
2018-01-25 21:26:24,"Sorry for missing those parts, but thank you! So, overall it seems that the frameworks such as backtrader and pyalgotrade are enough to stand on their own? As far as I can see, such frameworks can backtest strategies and can also connect to the brokers to do live trading. The only other parts missing would be a place to develop a trading strategy (any IDE) and the data. Am I understanding this correctly? Also, platforms like QuantConnect seem to have it all on its own right?"
2018-01-25 21:21:43,"Thank you! So you're saying to first focus on developing a profitable trading strategy before working on the infrastructure?

Also, what do you mean by ""paper DD""? What does DD stand for?

I've seen a lot about Interactive Brokers as well and it seems they would be a good choice."
2018-01-25 21:18:30,"I have built several algo systems for clients in the past. I strongly recommend you to work on back and forward tests first. It's not worth the time building a system if you have no statistical edge at all. So backtest your idea, reshuffle the trade history, test it against other assets, find correlations with other instruments, find predictive proxies for the underlying price movements (e.g. Oil, energy price movements, eurusd rates, etc. for heavy manufacturing enterprises). Only if you can beat the low risk underlying by a fair margin it's worth it economically speaking. (beating s&amp;p 500 when trading US stocks. From learning perspective it's always worth it to learn to develop a system. Do your paper DD and translate it to computer code. 

The second advice I can give you is not to fall for the HFT buzzword. Trade on longer time frames. HFT and short term strategies shop ( sub 1 minute) mostly do market making and statistical arbitrage (which evens out very fast, else everyone would abuse the arbitrage opportunity). Going for let's say 4h or daily time frame saves your account from excessive costs for fees, commissions and slippage as a retail trader.

For that purpose I can only recommend the IB API in terms of fee structure and retail usability. "
2018-01-25 21:16:01,I agree with the relative lack of info on advanced stuff for sure. Thank you!
2018-01-25 21:14:22,Were there any specific resources that you followed to build your own backtesting and trading platform? I found the book Successful Algorithmic Trading by Mike Halls-Moore and it seems like it covers a lot of that
2018-01-25 21:10:34,"Your answer is also very informative. Thank you! I took at look at many of the articles at QuantStart and it seems to be a great resource.

The book actually claims it walks you step-by-step in building a backtester w/ Python which seems fantastic"
2018-01-25 21:01:38,Risk skew is hard to identify. One must be hyper vigilant. 
2018-01-25 20:29:05,What have you tested so far?
2018-01-25 20:28:07,Maybe try building a reinforcement learning model in pytorch?
2018-01-25 20:25:40,"&gt; 4-6 months

I'd give yourself 9-12 months until it's going well. 

What makes this harder is the relative dearth of info on intermediate/advanced problems. 

As for using someone's framework, depends on what you're doing. Anything complex or fast will need custom code imo."
2018-01-25 20:21:49,"For what its worth I dont think there is much you can do using large/liquid futures markets and using traditional price based indicators such as MAs, ATRs, etc on a short time scale.



In my limited experience the main benefits of those type indicators show up on larger time frames such as daily or weekly bars and are mostly used for defense (reduced draw downs vs. buy and hold) rather than increasing returns.



The only real positive results I have had have been around more discretionary setups such as pattern recognition type setups which would be a bit harder to automate.   For example, things like dip buying off the bounce (hammer candle) of  trendline when the price is in an uptrend where you can use tight stops but let your profits run and look for 3x risk/reward are great (but it helps we are in a bull market).

2018-01-25 18:52:40,"Do you have a mathematical model of the market where any of those things make money? That might be a good place to start, or rather, start over. Write down a precise model of the market (or a piece of it), no matter how shitty and unrealistic, and find a strategy that does well in that model. Then list all the defects of your model and strategy you can think of, and start looking for papers that address those defects. As you do this, you will find more defects and better ideas, which lead to more papers... until you are reasonably confident you can capture the most relevant aspects of your chosen piece of the market's behavior mathematically. Now you have a chance of making theoretical money."
2018-01-25 18:50:06,"I had tried a long time ago doing extensive back testing and couldn’t find something that works either. Found a couple that works before accounting for bid ask spread and commission. I will advise to test out longer term strategies where costs of trading is proportionally lower than the expected movements. That might help some of the strategies.

Another good way is that when something doesn’t work, it helps to go through the individual trades on a chart to see if there’s a coding error.

It might be a good idea to consider if factors like major news releases might be adversely affecting the results and avoiding trading during those periods.

Don’t focus on individual indicators, they are not magical. "

I was not able to find a consistently profitable strategy, nor was I convinced that (m)any other people were doing better than random chance. (Sure, some people make money, but a lot of it is luck or their strategy boils down to a Martingale strategy- i.e. it appears to work repeatedly, but there is always a small chance of catastrophic loss).

I eventually gave up after several months without success. Thanks to back testing, my biggest monetary loss was the cost to access the API to gather data."

I guess what I'm envisioning is a part that actually connects to a broker to process the orders as well as other pieces. 

Sorry but I'm very new to this and am trying to understand the overall picture. As far as I know, Quantopian is built on top of the zipline library? I also heard that Quantopian disabled live trading, so I guess that's not an option anymore. Is it still worth it to use quantopian anymore? Are there other pieces still necessary for this?"

2018-01-25 15:28:01,"Thanks. I've worked professionally in this field for several years, so it comes from firsthand experience. Others' experience may vary.

I think the question itself reflects a sort of underdeveloped understanding of practical software/hardware performance considerations. Rather than just sort of point out that the question doesn't make sense and move on, I figured it might be more helpful to OP and others to at least be constructive.

Sometimes it feels like those with the least experience speak up the most around here, often just to be called out with more or less subtlety by those who might know more. 

There's a huge degree of variation in backgrounds, circumstances, and use-cases in the community, so I think it helps when we teach each other how to approach a problem, factor in relevant needs or requirements, and consider options. Arguing about a single answer doesn't seem so productive.

2013-09-09 17:22:50,"I mean that in FX speculation, for you to win, others must lose and vice-versa.

Money is not an investment in and of itself.  It's a useful financial instrument, but it doesn't grow in value on its own (in fact, the opposite is true, due to inflation).   There are incentives for people to trade even in conditions of negative expected return (e.g., companies hedge currency exposure), but in general, in the absence of an any forecasting abilities, you at best expect to break even, and due to inflation, taxes, transaction costs and speculators with non-zero information, you actually expect to lose money.   

This is not true for stocks, where the company you're investing in has an incentive to grow the company (without any help from you!), so you can stick money in an index fund and come back to it when you retire and reasonably expect to be better off.  

This is why there are index funds for stocks, but not currencies.  (And no long only FX funds, the concept makes no sense.)   There's no intrinsic growth in currencies, and unlike, say commodities, any scarcity is artificial.   You can make money off interest, I suppose,  but these days, that's also negative expected return after inflation if you're a private investor. 
"
2013-09-09 16:02:58,"It doesn't.

However if you think you have no edge over the other guys, then it implies you should stay out as who would want to play a zero sum game with no edge or where the other party has an edge.

If your broker thinks you are going to lose money they will keep the trade on their own book (not pass it to the market).
"
2013-09-09 15:34:20,"How does it impact me in a negative sense, though, assuming that process (points 1-4) takes place?"
2013-09-09 13:40:44,"Retail FX is generally settled as a contract for difference with you and your broker.

Let's look at the flow:

1. You make a trade say 1mn EURUSD @ 1.32 (assume you execute at this too)

2. Broker receives order, either a) passes it to someone else (straight to market) or b) sends some or none to the market keeping on the book (Betting against you)

3. You close 3 days later at 1.33 (assume you execute at this too)

4. Broker can either pass trade to market or keep on book again

If your broker kept the first trade on the book, they are down $10000 less transaction costs (about $1) so they lost $9998

In this sense FX is a zero sum game.

If they passed it to the market, somebody else assumed the risk on the entry and exit (can be two different players), this is like a pool with trades going around.

I excluded the overnight interest differential"

2013-09-08 21:51:12,"I strongly recommend you get a job in finance and learn on the job from people who have experience.  You also won't be putting your own money at risk and you'll get paid to learn.  

That's probably not the answer you're looking for.  If you absolutely must trade your own money (which i would *strongly* recommend against), I'd go for stocks.  FX is a zero-sum game and the FX market is much less regulated than equities.  The banks have an intrinsic edge because they have internal flow and a ton more information than you.  There are also fewer assets (so fewer opportunities and thus a lower Sharpe ratio) and you're much more sensitive to transaction costs.  

With stocks, you have more diversity and the market is less of a wild west, and there's a lot of information out there and it's not a zero-sum game.  The odds are better and you're more likely to to find a sustainable edge.   I would target long hold times so you're less sensitive to transaction costs.   If you're doing short-term trading, you'll probably get eaten alive by high frequency traders. 

I would stay far away from FX.  I would also stay away from options.  They're vastly more complicated and hugely volatile (especially near-expiry, near-the-money options), and some competitors have a much better information set than you (things like advance notice of dividend adjustments).  Options are scary unless you really know what you're doing.

2013-09-08 12:00:49,"I think the main advantage of being a retail is smaller capital and generally better flexibility. I don't think it makes sense for a firm to develop strategies that don't scale up to at least a few $100k. So rather than spending time optimizing the strategies to trade the components of Russell 2000, they might go with more general strategies to sweep up most of the profits and focus on specialized strategies in the most liquid stocks. That leaves a few niches open for exploitation. But that begs the question, if you had the skills to trade something like that, would it really be enough profit to justify spending a large part of your free time on research and development? "

2013-09-08 03:36:44,"what would you suggest to a retailer who is at her first experience with algo trading? is it forex worth it to begin with? stocks? options? I know that this depends on a lot of variables, but it seems that forex is mostly a scam - at least for us retailers.. 
besides, given a lot of trading firms with all these brilliant people, what is the chance of really getting a consistent edge for a single retailer?"
2013-09-08 01:21:30,"Not quite.  It's very different from firm to firm, but the *real* algorithmic trading firms do not have humans making trading decisions.   An algo firm has its trading done *entirely* by algos, with no human intervention under ordinary circumstances.   Practically speaking, a human will be watching risk because there's always the chance an algo will do something stupid.  We've seen this with Knight Capital (losing $450 million in 45 minutes) and recently, with Goldman Sachs's option's group.   (In both cases, it's understood what went wrong.)

Firms in which algos get passed on to a trader aren't really algo firms.  They are discretionary firms with quant support (many i-banks are like this).  i.e., quants write models and metrics to help traders make decisions, but they don't make trading decisions themselves.  I could go into an explanation why a firm might chose one method over another, but I'll pass for now.

Finally, there are instances of algos making all trading decisions but humans actually executing the trades, which is done for assets that can only be traded OTC.   I think this is pretty uncommon, but I know of instances in which this is the case, including at my workplace.

Who actually codes the algos is variable.  In firms with lots of tech support, it's dedicated developers.  In smaller firms, the researchers (quants) might code them up themselves, although there's likely to be some sort of safeguards developed by full-time developers.  (One would hope....)

I can't speak for all firms, but where I work it's almost all PhDs from top universities, myself included.  There are a few exceptions where I work.  If you want to do algo trading without a PhD, try getting an internship or working for an i-bank.  Most of the elite firms tend to favor PhDs in their research hiring, but their recruiters aren't robots. If you can prove your're smart without a PhD, you could get hired.  I know of at least one big pure quant fund that hires lots of non-PhDs.

Source:  I work at a pure quant firm (all algorithmic trading) and have friends at both other pure quant funds and  discretionary firms with quant support.

Themis are well-known HFT sycophants who spend a lot of time and money trying to shut down HFT for their own benefit.

The idea of auctions every X time is not a real solution because then the game simply becomes about who can be the last to put their order in before the next auction. Latency is thus still important. If people actually wanted such a system, any of the exchanges would've provided it by now. And Wellman and Wah are certainly not the first people who came up with that idea.

This has been answered many times on this thread and all over the internet, you can scrape commercial quality futures/fx data for free through ninjatrader. You can even implement your algo (it uses C#) and paper trade for free. Much of the core algo functionality is already done for you as well. 

&gt; Find a broker which has low transaction cost, paper trading and a good API. I'm thinking about using Interactive Brokers. They seem to have fair transaction costs and a solid API.

If you do find an edge...
If you do manage to capture it...
Why would you want a cheap broker? Heres a simple rule of thumb: You get what you pay for. With a cheap broker you might find that your good trades get poor execution but you bad trades get filled easily... why? Because the broker knows you are wrong and is taking the other side of the trade. Brokers are not your friend, especially the cheap ones.

&gt;What do you think of my plan so far? 

So far it sounds like you have done nothing."

Why?

You need to not only write your own algo code, but also you need to have code that takes data from your feed, and then updates things. It will likely have to be event-based, using price as a trigger. This requires a pretty hefty framework.
&gt; 

Algotrader.ch handles most of these things for IB. Esper + Java is what they use.

Also the OP needs to have good accounting/performance tracking.

Making a bunch of trades is useless if you can't track them as you will want to do analysis/attribution to refine your model.

2) I would avoid MATLAB.  It might do some math for you, but it's hard to translate that to something else.  What about Python?  They have data analysis type functionality and it's free.  Personally I wrote all my backtesting code in C++.

3) IB is a decent choice starting out.  I found their futures execution to be very poor compared to other platforms, like Zenfire, but your mileage may vary.

4) This is definitely the hardest part.  You need to not only write your own algo code, but also you need to have code that takes data from your feed, and then updates things.  It will likely have to be event-based, using price as a trigger.  This requires a pretty hefty framework.

I probably could have done something on my own, but there's a lot of code that could potentially go wrong, and it probably would have taken years to get bug-free.  And I'm a programmer with 20 years experience.  Instead, I went with using Ninjatrader.  They charge for it, but you can develop using C#, it's free to paper trade on, and their platform is pretty solid.

5) The idea that you can make adjustments to increase performance is where you need to change your point of view.  It's really ""make adjustments to hopefully increase the probability of success.""  You can't just tweak a variable to increase performance.  Everything is probability-based.  This isn't a 1 or 2 dimensional problem, where you can maximize your performance by flipping switches.  You are basically trying to predict the future, and no one can predict the future.  So you might flip a switch that causes your next 4 trades to lose, so you change it back, but had you stuck with that switch, maybe the 5 to the 20th trades would have been successes.  Or maybe it won't.  This is the nature of algo trading, in my opinion."

Any other platforms you'll end up reinventing the wheel or spending less time on strategies which should be your priority.  All platforms are going to have backtesting issues (its not an exact science) so you want something that has the best workflow for strategy development.

Are you talking about The Problem of HFT? That book is like 85 pages long. From my recollection, it is a super high-level survey on random things that may be going on, **two** of eight total chapters spent on interviews with him - which I consider the red flag of someone selling a personality rather than publishing some objective facts.

The problem with Haim Bodek, is that he writes a good story and makes a lot of people who are entirely outside of finance, or are wholly outside of trading and know little about market micro-structure feel as though they really understand what is going on. I think it is dramatically more complicated than what I read in that book and far more complicated than any of these fact-less ""documentaries"" or news pieces featuring him.

2013-11-11 16:04:39,"Can't overly large tick sizes impede price discovery though? There are market participants willing to trade at prices within the spread, but unwilling to cross the spread, and unable to trade passively due to overly large queues on the opposite side of the market. In a large-tick market, they simply do not trade, or pay concessions to fast passive orders to get their trades done. In markets that allow internalization the large tick increment also incentivizes filling orders off-exchange, since passive orders are overly compensated vs. the risk of holding positions, which makes on-exchange flow more toxic and discourages liquidity provision. 

The one-cent tick size in US markets has led to lots of hacks around it like inverted rebate schedules, midpoint orders that can't be displayed, off-exchange trading, etc. Combined with rebates/fees denominated in $/share, this leads to huge queues on cheap stocks with traders racing to be front of the book. Like you mention, it also leads to queue jumping in expensive stocks where 0.01 is small relative to the share price and spread. In other markets they scale tick size based on price and charge fees in bps which is more sensible.

The ""sweet spot"" is probably setting tick sizes based on security characteristics such as volume and volatility such that it trades with a relatively small spread in ticks most of the time, but is not constrained to 1 tick at all times. This prevents penny-jumping for economically insignificant amounts, but still allows natural interest to meet inside the spread and would allow market-makers to offer improved pricing."
2013-11-10 12:09:07,"Ah, interesting. I've only ever traded high volume securities so my impact on the price is negligible/nil. That allows my simulations to match real performance very tightly."
2013-11-10 09:09:13,"I think you may be missing superhash's point.

On paper you may be able to buy X shares at price Y because there's an offer there. And then when the price goes up you may be able to sell them at price Z because that offer exists too.

But in the real world, your first buy order may trigger another algo to also buy and drive up the price quicker, which may trigger another algo to dump a ton of shares. And suddenly, the way the price would've moved without your orders is entirely different than it is in live trading.

A new algotrader will start writing their app, do some backtesting and find that it works out *amazing*.  This may be due to overfittting the data, poor data to backtest with, or a bug in the way they are evaluating their strategy (i.e. not taking spreads, commissions or margin calls into account).

When these tests prove to be very successful, the desire to make ""real"" money overtakes any common sense a person would have so rather than testing with a demo account against live data a new algotrader may go straight for the ""live"" account instead.  They are confident in their algorithm, since their tests have proven to be so successful!  They start dreaming of that new house/car/boat/whore that they can get with their new found wealth that's about to come in like a giant wave of cash.

So when the losses start to roll in they start to make excuses.  ""It's not because of the app, it must be this major news event!""  ""I know exactly what's wrong, and it's not my app!""

Not everyone pauses to lick their wounds and face reality - their famous algorithm just doesn't work.  Instead these individuals tend to dig their heels in deeper, with pride kicking in now as they determine to prove that they are right.  Some will smarten up and start trading using a demo account, but this is not always the case.  Others will simply give up, calling everyone else a liar and claiming that there is no way to make money either in algotrading or in trading whatsoever and quickly denounce anyone who claims otherwise as a liar, thief or scam artist.

Those who persist can break on through to profitability, but often at a great initial cost for the reasons I mention above.  

The reality is that finding reliable data to backtest against can be hard, ensuring you can mimic a broker can be harder, and accepting that you may not be as good as you initially think can be hardest of all."

Participating in the market completely invalidates your simulation model as well because you have impacted the market and can longer simulate on the real market data. "

2013-11-03 19:17:28,monstimal gets it. The num of shares you buy and the desired profit affects the probability. So I can't post that it will go up X amount in the next days without the other two numbers.
2013-11-03 19:17:03,What's the risk on this position then?

One can then size based on the probabilities he obtained. A backtest might be able to obtain the optimal probability before a trade should be placed for instance (or how much max averse excursion might happen before the target is hit)

It sounds more like you're after VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting?"
2013-10-30 00:19:42,"Depends exactly what you're referring to. Market making means quoting both a price you're willing to buy at and a price you're willing to sell at. Anyone can do that at any time by entering a buy and sell order on the same instrument.

*Designated* market makers on the other hand are parties registered with the exchange as such, and have exchange-mandated obligations around things like how much of the time they have to make markets, and how wide (the spread on) that market can be.

In return they get incentives such as reduced transaction costs, fewer restrictions when it comes to short-selling, etc.

I doubt it's possible for individuals to become designated market makers; at least without incorporating. Exchanges want their designated market makers to be reliable.

2013-10-29 13:30:36,I agree EC2 is a reasonable low cost option.  I'd also suggest the OP look into a real trading platform like NinjaTrader.  Its free for development and low cost for live trading ($50/month).
2013-10-29 13:22:52,You have bigger issues than latency here.  You might want to look at the sidebar.

I had built my first strategies in excel vba and realized what a terrible platform it is and where coding/IT issues will cost you money.

You can get decent exchange access from IB which will solve some issues with yahoo (e.g. during adverse market events, google/yahoo will misdisplay a price then correct it retroactively).

That being said you could use any old server if $99/month is too expensive.
"
2013-10-29 09:49:48,"This is a good suggestion. Be aware of where your server resides, though. Amazon EC2 has multiple zones, with their primary centre in Virginia (US-East), I believe. If latency is an issue then you may wish to consider another service.

I used to run a system similar to this (on EC2), albeit in Ubuntu with TWS Gateway installed. I had it scripted to boot on and off prior and subsequent to US market hours. I did have to manually log in to TWS though to get it started. A little bit more scripting would allow complete automation."
2013-10-29 03:15:43,"Amazon has a Windows licence option in EC2, and depending on the specs you need, you may be able to fall into the free tier.

This is achieved by dividing larger volume orders into smaller trades and submitting them electronically. This case involves 2 markets and 2 stocks traded in each market with varying levels of volatility and liquidity, and it exposes traders to the basics of market microstructure and smart routing in the context of algorithmic trading. Traders will be required to program algorithms using Excel VBA to automate the market-making process and react to changing market conditions. Throughout the case, the algorithms developed will submit orders to create and unwind positions in response to market conditions, in addition to maximizing profits from the bid-ask spread and benefiting from any arbitrage opportunities that arise. Due to the high-frequency nature of the case, traders may face challenges in developing algorithms to adapt to changes in market dynamics."

Data management is easy, coding indicators/signals is easy, charting is easy, backtesting and performance evaluation is easy, etc. But you're always confined within the parameters that the MC/NT devs have laid out for you.

It's a trade-off between flexibility/power and ease of use. Personally I like to use MC.NET for charting and quick prototyping of ideas, but use standalone programs I've written myself for actual signal generation and trading."

Some pet peeves:

- No ""ONLY fill if spread moves past your limit"" capability. What it has is a really problematic implementation.

- Multi-timeframe in backtests seem to look into the future on the higher time frame OHLC value. Referencing Low of data2 (5min) tells you that in the next ~5 minutes, what is the low.

- No intraday time analysis. Like entries in the range from 11am-2pm usually lose money, etc which is present in NT.

- Intrabarordergeneration cancels and resends orders repeatedly as long as your functions change the entry price (due to the price moving between the bid/ask). Eg. Bid/Ask at 100,100.01. It's trying to go long at 99.98 or 99.99 depending on the last price but keeps cancelling the 99.98 limit (screwing up your queue)."

Any time you write indicators or strategies for any platform, it's going to have a certain degree of vendor lock-in, whether you write your own, or if you choose Ninjatrader, Tradestation, etc.  The good thing about Ninjatrader is that it's relatively straightforward to port to other platforms, since it doesn't use anything really voodoo-like."

And then when you chose a vendor you will become locked in. Congratulations, now you are dependent on them for support, bug fixes and updates while they figure out how to squeeze more money out of you. If product development stops, you will have to translate all your systems to another language.

For the retail trader though, trading platforms are pretty much the only practical way. Not many want or can spend months/years programming their own platform from scratch."

I use Ninjatrader, and it's not a programming language, it's a trading platform.  You use C# to write your algos in, so it's relatively easy to pick up.  It's decent and well documented.  They handle most of the details for you, like knowing how to connect up to various brokerages, downloading data, graphing, backtesting, etc.  I can connect up to Zenfire, IB, TDAmeritrade, etc, all from the same program, and execute algos on any of them.

It's a good piece of software, but like anything there are a bunch of things it lacks, and some things that I hate about it.  But for a trading platform, it's probably one of the best ones out there.  The biggest downside is the cost.  I paid $1500 for a lifetime license."

2013-01-19 12:33:22,"dumb question, but what is MLP?"
2013-01-19 12:08:15,"""Handbook of Quantitative Finance and Risk Management"" Has a good examples of decision trees and all kinds of things with references to papers, but sadly what we are doing is based on original thought, no papers, and you will probably end up in the same boat, you will find good papers on ML and good papers on Finance and maths but rarely to they meet.

When looking for ideas in scientific papers I find it best to either look for papers on new modeling ideas or new techniques rather than both. Then either implement the model using and use the output to generate signals for an algo or use the new technique on an existing model I have and see if it's any improvement on the current generation."
2013-01-19 11:31:01,"This is an awesome list, thanks. I'd also be interested to hear of anyone successfully using a MLP or other ANN model for trading. "
2013-01-19 11:15:43,Would be interested to hear of any papers you find useful for using decision trees in fixed income / derivatives.
2013-01-19 08:37:31,"I have had a lot of success using descion trees in fixed income and dervivites markets however I not sure if they would be applicable to equity prices.

I'm not 100% sure that ML represents value for money when it comes to the time a guy on his own would recieve. If you are smart enough to understand and impement a ML strategy I'm pretty sure you would see easier returns on more simple strategy.

As a side note ML is a frequent topic in the IRC channel."

Just always make sure your orders have a hard stop at the time of placing the order.

2013-05-09 11:16:34,"6e as of right now is 164k / contract notional exposure, but only requires 2475 in margin so its 66x leveraged.....  (USD values)"
2013-05-09 11:04:46,It should be emphasized at this point that this very much depends on your strategy. Margin is a completely arbitrary amount. The actual amount risked per contract may be higher or lower than your margin requirement.
2013-05-09 09:54:34,"Ok thanks, you mentioned highly leveraged, not sure if you were thinking of certain futures.  To start we're only trading 6E and will expand to other currencies in due time."
2013-05-09 08:57:03,"its not a hard and fast rule about 40% but if youre trying to approach investors for funding, youll find considerable difficulty trying to justify why almost 100% of your cash was at risk.  plus the nature of the futures business is that most investments are not ""fully funded""  meaning say someone wants to give you 10mm to invest in your strategy, they wont give you the 10mm in cash, but some smaller number, say 5mm, since your mte never crosses 50%, this way everyone wins, you get to trade 10mm of capital and reap fees on it, and they get to invest 5mm somewhere else.  etc.  if you dont plan on ever trying to raise assets for this, you can go wild.  but for safetys sake, 40% is pretty high.  almost half your capital at risk on a single trade, a one-off event [flash crash] etc in highly leveraged futures could wipe you out."
2013-05-07 12:31:19,"The mc randomizes the sequence of about 150 trades made over the past 10 months.  My original purpose was to see if our trade sizing and money management practices were sound (i.e. the probability that our algo would bust given a bad streak).  We obviously want to ""go up in limits"" after banking some wins.  I can't remember if it was you or another poster that suggested we adjust our AUM on a monthly basis and keep our risk % the same across that month.  This would negate occurrences where a big win followed by a few losses would not magnify the few losses due to increasing trade size.

So now that I am calculating mte (will use your abbr) with a static AUM and risk % (all trades the same size), I have received these results at 5%:

        Ratio	Occurrences
        15%	4
        20%	312
        25%	420
        30%	205
        35%	46
        40%	8
        45%	4
        60%	1


and these results at 8%:

    Ratio	Occurrences
    0%	1
    20%	31
    25%	251
    30%	291
    35%	193
    40%	118
    45%	49
    50%	25
    55%	17
    60%	7
    65%	6
    70%	1
    75%	0
    80%	1
    85%	1
    90%	1
    95%	1
    100%	1
    
Is the general rule to **never** let the mte cross 40% or if the majority of the time (i.e. 89%?) if the average for a trial stays below it is it considered ok?

If I'm calculating this value prior to each trade ([contracts] x [margin per contract] / [starting balance]) I could obviously adjust the trade size so that it is always below the 40% threshold but I am still not sure how it is calculated, let me know how you use it."
2013-05-07 12:15:45,"what is the purpose of the mc simulation ?  obviously if you have a strategy, running it over and over again on the same dataset will yield the same results.  im not quite understanding what you are trying to accomplish.  money management, be it scaling up AUM, or keeping it static will only vary the dollar returns of the account, but shouldn't change the % returns in any way [apart maybe by decreasing it due to larger trade size, more commissions, more slippage]  but essentially it will stay the same.  ie if you make 1 trade a month, that yields 1%, after 12 months you still have made 12%, however if you constantly true up your AUM, your dollar number in the trued up example will be much higher.  dollar returns are generally useless to investors."
2013-05-07 09:17:19,"Ok I modified my monte carlo sim to keep AUM static (I just set it to 100k), as well as trade size (5% of AUM), when I do this however all of my sims come out as the same final balance.  So I'm a little confused as to the benefit of not modifying trade size or AUM.

Anyway when I do this I am caculating MER (or mte as you call it) as (total margin used for trade)/(beginning balance prior to initiating trade) is this right or do I do it on a daily basis?  If daily do I take the starting balance or the ending balance in the denominator?  Lastly if I do this on a daily basis, I will need to take a multiple of the balance for multiple trades otherwise this ratio will go over 100% (I only have 1 trade active at a time)."
2013-05-07 08:36:07,"generally speaking a good strategy shouldn't go above 40% mte [margin to equity]

in simulations, i would keep the AUM static for the lifetime of the simulation, this way each trade essentially is normalized against all the others.  you dont want your strategy to look artificially better because you have a bunch of winners in a row and scale up the AUM.  cash management in actual trading sure, but you want to make sure you have a sound strategy first."
2013-05-06 19:54:32,"Also I started using the advice you offered, but came across a problem I need to solve.

For my Monte Carlo sim I reset AUM every 4 weeks to be 80% of the starting balance for the 1st week.  For one of the scenarios I was testing  the balance fell below AUM (4 times out of a 1000 trials).  Would you lower the AUM a fixed amount (say reset it 80%) or just substitute the balance amount for AUM until balance grows above AUM at which point the fixed AUM amount would be used until the next 4 week period?

Lastly is 80% for AUM too aggressive or does it make more sense to make it 70 or 50%?  I just pulled 80% out of the air, but perhaps I should look at my max drawdown stats to calculate what a good number would be."
2013-05-06 17:21:19,"I remember looking them up before, $750 for complete history for 1 symbol is a little steep, but I guess if the data is legit it might be worth it."
2013-05-06 16:57:09,"You need to pay for it.  

I use IQFeed, they're about $80/month for complete futures tick data and all equities.  They go back 120 days in terms of historical data for every single symbol that they have.

You can also purchase yearly tick data from TickData.  It's about $125/yr for tick data per symbol, and then $10/month per symbol."
2013-05-06 15:10:41,what fixed % of assets do you use if you don't mind me asking?  From what I have researched it seems 1-5% is typically the range.  For my testing I have been overly aggressive and start it off at 15% which maxes out my AUM due to margin and then after certain milestones are hit I gradually lower the % all the way down to 2%.
2013-05-06 14:51:22,"1) you can change your AUM whenever you want in actual trading, but for simulated results, i would hold aum constant (at something like 10mm)  it makes life easier in simulation if youre not constantly changing, this way you can see margin:equity, etc

2) yup

3) you dont necessarily want to scale up all your profits, because a small loss after scaling up could be much larger dollar loss, ""cash management"" is just as important of any trading strategy as is the actual signals to buy and sell.  id read into a bit further to make educated ideas about ""trade size"" and ""cash management""  for example, i typically have each trade size a fixed % of assets, and only change my AUM monthly. 

4. euro future currency - PM me and i can help you out with further data.  also do you understand how back adjusted data works for futures?  that will be important to you, as futures contracts are constantly rolling to new months, youll need one smooth set or prices [aka back adjusted]"
2013-05-06 14:37:32,"1)Can AUM change on a trade by trade basis?

For example, start with $20k as AUM (total balance of account), first trade is a profit of 3200, new AUM = 23200, second trade is a loss of (1500), new AUM = 21700.

2) I guess I'll google equity curve, I'm already calculating Sharpe but the template my friend gave me has Sharpe on Size and Sharpe Average on Size (he trades stocks) so I don't think the way he calculates Sharpe translates directly to futures since futures trades do not have a size per se.

3) Wouldn't risking more (as increasing AUM implies) naturally scale up if the algo is profitable?  Regarding the 10+ years of data, I haven't been able to get a hold of reliable 6E data, so I am only going off the past year's worth of data which I have collected.  Already started a thread on data separately in this subreddit."
2013-05-06 11:21:03,"1) you need to set an AUM for which you are going to trade, then your returns are realizedPNL/AUM.  AUM can change whenever you want, daily, monthly, weekly, etc.
1a) you measure returns daily, you will have some realized (closed positions) and some open positions (unrealized)
1b) a key statistic is margin to equity (total Margin/AUM)  not maxLoss is just a system parameter, which has nothing to do with performance.

2) see point 1a above.  youll need daily returns. every investor will want to see daily returns broken down in any number of ways, sector/contract/algo/etc
2a) here youre talking about constructing and equity curve, youll need this per contract/sector/algo/etc
2b) surely you can google ""sharpe ratio""

3) youll need returns that scale up as AUM increases.  remember to take into account transaction costs, slippage entering/exiting positions, and a long enough time frame (10+ years) 

you can PM me for more stuff..."
2013-05-05 17:44:13,"Simple answer:
1) It's time series analysis, so you know that already, but traders refer to it as technical analysis, their objective functions tends to be profit/max-drawdown.

2) anything you can predict, in any timeframe, if you just predict direction then your position sizing is binary, that's not effective risk management.

3) see #1

value/risk, more of a stats question, good luck.
When you come up with something, please post so we can piggyback on it."
2013-05-05 05:42:50,"No, you need return on capital to calculate Sharpe. Same for Sortino and Calmar/MAR. Calculate annualized excess (of the rate you borrow at) returns and standard deviation, and divide."
2013-05-05 00:20:43,"Ok this circles back to how I originally was calculating ROI, I understand why you put it in quotes since it is not an ROI per se, but a metric used to measure performance which is what I was originally seeking.

So I guess the point I am at now is, can this metric be used to calculate Sharpe ratios in place of a true ROI?"
2013-05-04 23:54:41,"He could use the max of margin and maxDD on the trade to proxy capital he risked for each trade.

1 contract margin &lt; total account margin"
2013-05-04 23:51:24,"Your ""ROI"":

T1: 2893.52/ max((12.5*n),margin)
T2: -2693.12/max((2693.13),margin)
T3: 2912.7/max((1586.44),margin)

This would not give you ""return on investment"" but a metric similar, it would be the ratio of profit to capital at risk.

Remember Trading is NOT investing/Asset Management so do NOT borrow too many of their metrics. With futures contracts your maximum loss is the greater of your maxDD or margin amount."

2013-05-04 23:12:41,"Ok I think I took everyone's advice.  I created trade segments by week.  So I have 46 weeks worth of backtest data and I randomize the weeks and then order the trades by week (random), date (so trades within the same week are sequential).

Then I captured every single drawdown that was not sequential, so if there was a $10 drawdown followed by a $12 drawdown and then finally a $15 drawdown, only the $15 drawdown was captured when all 3 occurred across sequential trades.

Finally I created this DD chart, do I care more about the percentages per 1,000 trials or the percentages across the universe of all drawdowns in all trials?

[DD Chart](http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/7528/dddistribution.png)

The per 1k was a guess based on occurrences / trials (1000).

After doing a direct query against the trials, I found only 1.5% of the trials had a drawdown &gt;= 85%
so the universe might be more appropriate.  I'll run another query when the 10k trials are done that more accurately reflects the likelihood that large drawdowns will occur."

Can you elaborate, like do you use trade segments like 3 trade sequences?  If it helps the most trades my system makes in any given day is 3, minimum is 0, usually 1, sometimes 2 trades per day.

Some Maniac's use a 3 or 4 step transition matrix.

Also remember when simulating what happens when your capital drops as you may not be able to make the same sizes of trades as before.

"
2013-05-04 18:04:59,"But you never risked 12k. By this logic, in your example above you ""risked"" $55687.5 but you only had $20k in capital, how does that work? And in any case the margin is unrelated to what your actual risk is. If you buy 10 ES and set a one point stop, you're risking $500 + slippage, not 10 * whatever margin your broker set.

Also this is why you should ignore margin and just calculate return on capital. "
2013-05-04 17:40:34,"hmm, not sure I follow

1 trade on 10k margin  PNL = 0 so 0%

1 trade on 1k margin PNL = 50 so 5%

1 trade on 1k margin PNL = 50 so 5%

Add them up? for 10% when it gained $100 on $12k *risked*

Another way to look at the above trades is 10 contracts, 1 contract, 1 contract

Anyway, not sure if you trade futures, but I have seen different traders use a myriad of formulas to calculate ROI (some listed above)."
2013-05-04 17:30:02,"Oh, well that's obviously nonsensical. Imagine you had another trade for 10k in margin which had a return of $0. Even though it didn't affect your profitability, by that measure your returns would decrease. If you calculate return on margin (which you shouldn't), you want to calculate the returns on each trade and then add those up."
2013-05-04 17:28:17,"3114 / (17325+19800+18562.5) = 0.0559

Another method I had seriously considered was this

Daily ROI = [PNL] / ( MAX([margin]) + SUM([max loss]) )

so for those 3 trades as an example, below I'm using max loss values that I did not originally show in post.

Daily ROI = 3114 / ( 19800 + (14x125 + 16x162.5 + 15x50) )

Daily ROI = 12.5%

max loss = contracts x value of trade if initial stop loss is triggered (the maximum the trade can lose irrespective of slippage)"
2013-05-04 17:11:27,And how do you get 5.59% out of those margin values?
2013-05-04 17:00:28,"Futures, 6EM3 my broker requires a $1237.5 intraday margin per contract.

So: 

first trade 14 contracts x 1237.5 = $17,325 (profit: 2894)

second trade 16 contracts x 1237.5 = $19,800 (loss: 2693)

third trade 15 contracts x 1237.5 = $18,562.50 (profit: 2913)

They all happen to be below the $20k original balance, but the contract size still changes after each trade based on my risk calculation.

ETA: trades never overlap, if a new trade is triggered, I exit the previous trade (this only happens in opposing directions buy/sell)

ETA2: The buysize/sellsize is from his template which he uses for stock transactions and for him to calculate sharpe average on size, so might not be applicable for futures. If the first and third trades were long they would add up to the buysize for the day and second trade was short, the sellsize."

+3114 | 15.57% ROI

I guess that is fine, using margin (only) I would get: 5.59%
A friend gave me a spreadsheet template he uses to calculate Sharpe and he takes the (buysize + abs(sellsize))/2 which effectively doubles my ROI to 11.2%

2013-04-28 15:34:15,"1) blogs might point you in the correct direction, you can freely find snp500 buy/hold beating strategies online. You wont find what works best there though, people generally keep that to themselves but might hint towards it. 

2) price prediction is too difficult, in the last decade we have seen the snp500 go from 800 -&gt; 1600 -&gt; 700 -&gt; 1600, so to try and model this process will be extremely difficult if not impossible because you are dealing with a time variant system. Most investors did not see the subprime implosion coming, if they had the market would not have gone that high or dropped that low between '05 and '10, but it did, so price rarely reflects true value, you will struggle to model it that way, this is why I dont particularly believe in fundamental analysis, not because its wrong, but because the markets are uninformed and irrational.

3) I would be careful when dealing with media attention and popular opinion/outlook. We just saw what happened this week in the DOW because of the media, it was not the first or the last time this will happen. Also remember that popular opinion is not always correct, the market is still controlled by investor sentiment but every day the machines become a little more influential.

If there one piece of advice I can give you: 95% of people fail at this, its not a get rich quick scheme, if you think otherwise, you are setting yourself up for failure. its takes lots of hard work and hair pulling to succeed. "

2013-04-26 13:38:49,"Any long journey begins with the first step. Learn to structure your thoughts. In a nutshell, quant trading is just plain old buy/sell based on rules that is applicable to a stream of dynamic information flow. Simple output, generated from a well thought-out process that clearly define condition to take certain actions. A wise person wrote that trading must be caught, not taught. Observe, dissect, test hypotheses, reflect, lather rinse repeat. Everything else is just technical knowledge to answer the big question: ""how do you know if anything is true?""

Mental framework is top priority. Then search for proper knowledge and understanding to build the components.

It all comes down to buy low sell higher or sell high buy lower - magnitude and direction. Probability and risk/reward are inseparable couple. Do not get dazzled by instruments. Spot or option are different sides of the same coin. Just different technical execution to profit off the same movement pattern. One is distance-bound, the other is also time-bound. 

Problem solving ingenuity will save you. Don't pollute your mind with unnecesary crap wrapped in exotic  terms. Risk and reward are functions of error. Behavioral stochastics &amp;amp; physics framework applies. No financial/statistical voodoo will get rid of risk. Neither do PhD's. Law of large numbers will prevail.

2013-04-26 01:08:50,"1) 'Algorithmic Trading and DMA' is as decent an attempt I've seen at comprehensive treatment of the topic. It's similar to a textbook in that, if you're really ready for it, a full quarter of it should seem remedial, half should feel kind of obvious, and less than a quarter should be illuminating. Some trading strategies are covered but they're generally the institutional type, not the proprietary type which are way more valuable. [Then read this paper](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/Baron_Brogaard_Kirilenko.pdf).
2) Yes. Guessing the price ahead of time would help you make money more reliably. Either can help but it's simultaneously less sophisticated and more nuanced than you seem to think. A lot depends on the amount of margin you have and what kind of strategy you're running.
3) Yeah, all that stuff is important(ema's, correlations, regressions, etc). Way off the mark w/r/t media attention and popular opinion/outlook, though. What Jim Cramer/CNBC thinks isn't even on the radar for the pricing intervals you should be interested in. Ransquawk is probably the only news source that hf traders really use. A word from them can drive any market multiple ticks within seconds.

A good place to learn about this stuff would be a prop trading firm that does algorithmic trading successfully. If you really do have decent chops in stats/coding/machine learning they'll hire you for a good salary pretty quickly, and you can start taking notes and in 2-3 years you'll know what you don't know know. This isn't exactly an easy problem that nobody's taken the time to investigate, I'm sure you realize, and so early on, at least, you're probably going to need to learn from someone who's already trading and making money, and those people are generally with firms. That is unless you're a total savant, in which case I'm wasting my time and you already know what to do."

The answer is obviously both to me, because the market is a cumulative compilation of human (and frequently electronic) decisions.  You can't predict price based on price.  You can predict human decisions based on their holdings at certain prices. The market is a never ending series of stop runs and market makers exercising leverage.

If your algo does something simple like... if the exch rate differs from the old running average by n%... trade! but what is n? a parameter to your algorithm!! We expect that some value of n will give the best performance... sure, you could do it by hand... 3 is good 4 is better... 6 sucks... which value of n should we try next?

Or: we can automate this process!!! Use a learning algorithm to look at the old data and choose values for parameters which optimize performance-- Go have some coffee while your system figures out how to be good at what it needs to do... that's what programming's all about!

It gets even better, since algorithms can have many, many parameters... just figure them out if you have enough data!

(And then test the algo on new data which you didn't use to train it to see if it really works as well as you think it should...

With traditional TA, you rely on the indicator itself to give you a certain signal. ""When X happens, that generally means the market is in state Y"".

What I'm proposing is taking a time slice from a time in the past (say 72 hours) to the present, and then backtracking through historical data and finding a similar 72-hour slice of time where the price behaved identically. The idea then is that the behavior of the price after the historical time slice will closely resemble what the price will be in the future, since all steps leading up to them where almost the same. "
2013-04-17 04:53:37,"I would reconsider and think about using Volume. Volume has so much to say regarding price movements.

How is this any different from what you have described? If it isnt, then I have been lead to believe that the system you are describing is almost useless. I could be wrong though, as I said before, I dont know a thing about TA.
"
2013-04-16 20:47:44,"Always has the correct answer.  There are plenty of people who debate emh but think about it like this, there are thousands of the top stats minds looking at algo trading.  If this was a useful strategy it would be arbitraged out at this point, or probably move so fast you cant react.  now plenty of other people wil argue about technical trading but the stats generally speak againt it.  Further I don't know your background but if you work with data streams you will find repeating patterns.  I am often surprised how long some streams can be 10, 15 digits and still match up even though the source is entirely wrong and not at all related.  My point is that in large data sets it won't be hard to match patterns but its sort of like how you notice white vans everywhere when the FBI says they are looking for a white van.  There aren't anymore and they aren't related but they exist.  I guess the test would be when you match a pattern how often do you match the next moves, and could you have really profitably traded the event.  For instance is your back testing taking into account order depth?"

2017-08-20 06:10:05,"In financial engineering GPUs are used commonly in things such as monte-carlo simulations.

GPUs are fast when compared to a CPU. For example floating point operations when done on a GPU can be anywhere between 2x-10x faster than a CPU, based on the nature of the operation and the GPU.

But there's a catch...

GPUs don't implement IEEE754 floating operations by default, they use (regardless of brand or model) a more simplified less onerous form of floating point operations.

This has the side effect that the computations once done end up having errors in them at larger orders than what would be seen when done on a CPU. For games and other kinds of visualisations this is not an issue.

This though does become an issue when performing calculations - that will say lead to a buy/sell action where the difference between one action or the others is within some bound.

Coming back to our monte-carlo example. A GPU can beat a CPU by some factor when computing a given MC, however due to the errors in floating point operations, the number of samples required to get a result that is much closer to a CPU's result, is generally much greater. This difference somewhat reduces the competitive nature of using GPUs for things like monte-carlo.

----

Now all that being said, it is true that GPUs can perform exact IEEE754, however once in that mode, the floating point operations take about the same or a little more than executing them either on the x87 FPU or similar SSE/AVX/AVX2/AVX512 instruction sets, furthermore the GPU in this mode will typically consume more energy than a CPU performing the same operation.

For a cash account, which is possible in Robinhood, it takes 3 days to settle (I believe that's changing to 2 in the US next month). Both of those make it difficult for algorithmic methods to work well.

If you are swing trading the ups and downs, then sub-minute is hardly important. If you are trying to snatch up arbitrage on a single exchange, then sub-second becomes very important because you are competing with another bot on that exchange who is going to be placing an order at the same time as you and who ever gets there first is going to get the pennies.

But since most of these exchanges use web api's, you are looking at realistic lower bounds of about 1/10th of a second possible, so not exactly HFT by any means."
2017-08-19 14:25:16,"This isn't quite true. It's not the amount of code that is present, it's the number of opcodes (and the speed of those opcodes as that varies on many platforms) in the execution path, but then there is also cache coherency and pipelining to take into account.

Assuming that the code difference is small enough as to not cause the cache to be flushed, loop unrolling is often an effective means of optimization. So if you need to go through a loop 10 times, the unrolled version will be 10 times larger but may execute faster because the execution path is smaller.

Similarly , you could lock down a processor hard with a simple opcode that implements a tight loop. That's a very small piece of code for a lot of slow."

2015-01-25 13:59:47,"So let's break the problem down into pieces.

Before we even talk about strategy, can you do the following?

1. Write code that receives market events and formats them in a way to process

2. Store the data from 1

3. Send an order

4. Receive the confirmation from the order

5. Receive a fill

6. Cancel or modify an order

7. Track your positions and holdings

8. Process the data from 1/2


I put 8 last as processing the data and formulating business decisions is probably the last thing to do, as you need all of the above. 

Then coming up with hypotheses, and rejecting them until you find one that you fail to reject, and can then test on a sim account and then moving to a real money account.

2015-01-24 01:37:05,"Everything I trade is highly liquid and the spread is extremely tight, for the amount of time that my partners and myself have to put into our trading system this has been a key assumption we've made for every future / equity that we trade in. Furthermore, I don't have extremely short hold times and, for the most part, I look for larger wins that are more than a few cents for stocks or a point or less for futures which inherently allows me to not be as concerned about the bid, ask and the spread between. 

I will say that this is one of the areas that my partners and I are looking to become better managed in but the way we manage risk here is that our models don't just predict entry points, they also predict the next value of each indicator. If a position opens when three indicators equal true, when two of the three are true then the models will look into the future to determine at what value the third indicator should become true and at what point in time that will occur. Once we know that we place a limit order for the corresponding entry point and we update it as needed (as long as there is no / minimal cost to changing the order) so our slippage doesn't occur; conversely we'll use limits to cap the amount of slippage we're willing to accept if we're going long and the current price is below the target entry price. The same applies to exits in models that have a target state (i.e. cointegrated pairs trading). Models that we let ""run"" until the momentum they're carrying is out of steam often see a bit of slippage when we sell since we use market orders. This hurts us when we sell but the benefits of letting the momentum carry us instead of setting arbitrary price targets (or even dynamic targets that we've found) far outweighs the negatives since we see a few home runs from time to time. If you have advice / thoughts on this I'd love to hear your perspective.

To me, average trades per day is a meaningless metric, its more about understanding the full picture between the ratio of number of trades, expected win:loss ratio, and risk (i.e. average loss per loss, average profit per win); there are others but these are the first ones I look at when determining performance. Having said that, depending on market volatility some of my models trade between 20-100 trades / day and others only make one trade per week."

Hedge funds maybe. Prop shops on the other hand, rely on people ""less smart"" than them to make the bosses tons of money. In exchange, prop firms provide capital and/or leverage. It could be right that the bosses still wouldn't be interested in purchasing an algo, since typically they have all traders in-house as if they were employees. Aside from hedge funds and prop shops, there are middle men that broker sale of algos, though what can be found online does not seem that lucrative."

2015-01-23 00:48:43,"On the execution time: I just looked at the source code for e.divisive, it basically while loops e.split which is an ugly loop in itself, i'll pass these notes to the author, as something seemed strange for me (2 hours on monthlies data!).

ecp:::sig.test has a silly programming issue, D1 is iteratively computed although its independent of the looped parameters. D1 should be computed outside of the for loop.

ecp:::e.divisive inside of the while loop calls e.split and calls sig.test, and only having the Estat parameter dependent on the loop, inside of that function the only thing Estat going in as the obs argument does is a logical evaluation against tmp[[4]], tmp[4]  could be computed (takes R calculations) once as opposed to K&gt;0 times multipled by R storing that result as a vector.

Preallocating the vector and then writing to the spot vs copying+appending may be faster (theoretically yes however I am unsure)

Run the random test at least 10 times and take the average. It will vary a lot. If the algorithm is *significantly* better than random, then I know it has potential.

2015-01-17 15:18:33,"I was working for a fixed income fund and trading FX on the side at the time, I don't run a single strategy but rather many of them.

I read a fair bit of academic papers and textbooks trying to understand not necessarily a profitable algorithm but what are the tools I have to play with, I then created the precursor to my current system it was doing mainly ""trend-following"" and reversal detection.

I've since refined it a lot and added on multiple strategies and also a capital allocator transforming the problem from which strategy to pick to identifying the conditions in which the various ones will thrive and allocating them capital accordingly.

2015-01-17 14:51:23,"At the highest level, there are two generic algorithm types that Retail traders typically have the capital for to implement on automated trading systems: mathematical based systems and behavioral prediction models.

Mathematical based systems are typically based off of statistically relevant price changes, momentum, differences between multiple contracts / equities, etc. Examples of these systems include mean reversion, pairs trading, and arbitrage. Developing these models is actually relatively straight forward, there are numerous websites that depict how to create these systems including those below. These models are typically more risk averse and can easily be applied to any time duration whether it is a highly traded model (i.e. using actual tick or sub second data) or a lower frequency model with longer hold periods. Note - although high frequency trading systems are mathematical based, retail traders don't typically have the capital and resources available for HFT. 

Behavioral prediction models use technical indicators as the foundation for determining signals for when to buy or sell; essentially you're trying to predict the movement off of the stock from historical behavioral patters. Examples of these are moving average crossover, RSI / MACD combinatorial models, Bollinger band reversals, etc. These models are significantly easier for novice traders to implement because you can simply look at a chart with indicators, identify a theory, quantify it and test it. Although these models can be applied to short-term trading where the hold period is short (on average &lt; 2 days) given the relative volatility for short-term trading compared to what one would accept for longer holding periods, it is very difficult to quantify stop losses in a way that allows winning trades to run while preventing losses from quickly becoming excessive. I personally have found that these types of models excel when the bar width used is between 20-40 minutes. Examples can be found here and here.

I use both of these models in my trading system. My personal process for creating a new model starts like this:

* 1) Identify a theory
* 2) Capture the historical data (I have access to actual historical tick data, and although it is aggregated, I can simulate what actually happened down to second by second changes)
* 3) Code the system to capture the metrics that are needed in the model (my partners and I have built our own trading framework on top of AlgoTrader)
* 4) Run the historical data through my system to generate the variables for each indicator / metric I want to capture (historical data essentially starts as just the time and the price, I may append the 30 minute moving average with 9 period look back and the 30 minute moving average with 20 period look back to the file - oversimplified here)
* 5) Take the output with the price and indicator data and import it into R
* 6) Run several scripts I've developed to determine what coefficients should be applied to the model (the output of R will tell me that for the two aforementioned moving averages, when the second standard deviation for the difference between the 9 period look back period and the 20 period look back period 1% and that it takes, on average, ten 30 minute periods (5 hours) for the difference between the two periods to return to 0).
* 7) I code the rule (in this case, when the difference between the 9 period MA is &lt; or &gt; 1% from the 20 period MA, buy or sell depending on whether the 9 period is below or above the 20 period MA).
* 8) Run the test, verify output 
* 9) Repeat step 6 &amp; 7 until the output meets my risk / reward level (I may change the number of standard deviations between the two moving averages that I think is appropriate)
* 10) Recode model for paper testing 
* 11) Verify model performs as expected
* 12) Move model to production (get no sleep for the first few days)

When creating your model, you will likely want to use a combination of attributes from both mathematical and behavioral based models. Regardless of which direction you take, the difficult part is collecting the data and running the analysis over and over until you can find the right combination of coefficients to implement. Furthermore, there are other challenges you will face when moving from back testing to paper / live trading, but thats another conversation.

Clearly not the full picture but the point is you could make some basic forecasting based on historic prices and some number manipulation. Later read up on machine learning and/or financial econometrics for actual forecasting techniques. If you don't have a strong finance background you should probably also get a book on investment theory and read up on trading (academic investment theory forms the basis of how to create an investment portfolio and handle risks etc and is quite good to understand if you want to do any kind of trading).

I probably spent 4-5 years trading forex, futures, stocks, and options until I finally realized it just is never going to work out. I really paid for my education...haha. Having skin in the game made me very eager to learn.

It is hard to say if the education will amount to anything. I can't determine if the amount of time I've spent learning finance things is worth the potential profits (or losses).

Right now I'm just working on forex algorithms trading through Oanda's rest api because I don't trust myself enough to trade anything that requires a lot of capital. The downside of that is that I am stuck with a big bid/ask spread which forces my algos to be 30min-4hr positions. Eventually the goal is to prove to myself that I can trust my algorithms and move to interactive brokers and trade with the interbank spreads using a lot more capital. Interbank spreads have a much tighter bid/ask which would allow me to trade more short term algos.

Other than my current plans I am always learning things along the way. I'm still a developer at heart.

My oanda rest api client was written in Go.
I pulled historical 5second data and started to analyze and backtest against it with Julia because R was just too slow.  (non-vectorized backtesting, I couldn't figure out a good way to do vectorized backtesting with bid/ask spread and constant target/stop prices).
I'm starting to learn more about statistics but I'm not sure what is useful. So far I've used pretty much only monte carlo simulations and some other things to make sure my algo isnt overfitting.

Right now I am trying to ditch my Go client because the code is just too verbose so I'm rewriting it in clojure.

2015-05-06 23:02:37,"Heh because C# is a lot easier.  Writing .NET code is a lot simpler than C++.  And until you're an expert with C++ you're just as likely to shoot yourself in the foot as you are to write code that is appreciably faster than C# code.  

You use C++/FPGA's etc when dev time is less important than computer time (ie the speed is worth the cost).  In general I like to follow the mantra: (1) make it work, (2) make it pretty, (3) make it fast.  Optimize for speed when you are actually missing trades due to a lack of speed (caveat obviously for market microstructure trades).  

Speed and dirt cheap transaction costs are generally a panacea for bad strategies, but they don't completely cure stupid.  Good luck!  And don't be afraid to e-mail a random professor and ask them to sign off on your paper account for the Summer.  Maybe come up with a research paper topic and write it. "

If you're interested in HFT then there's nothing wrong with reading through different exchange protocols to look for edge: http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/MDP+3.0+Message+Specification (That's CME's for a start, it's pretty clean and well documented considering).  "

Keep the language super simple (I would go for a higher level one than C++ such as Python, Java, or C#).  In fact, I would suggest C# since it's a very marketable skill even outside of trading.  Just get something up and running, reading market data and placing orders on an IB paper account.  Then iterate from there!  Good luck!

Filter all the garbage tweets, if you get a legit one, then that gets passed along to the trading platform API which ids the symbol and executes the trade according to whatever the algo decides.

For example I trade futures with NinjaTrader. So I can use a C# twitter api found here: https://tweetinvi.codeplex.com/
Filter tweets based on whatever, then pass that along to the platform( which uses C#) to be executed. "

2015-07-28 03:13:20,"I'll definitely write some posts about that, as soon as I'll do that, you'll be the first one to be noticed (to write about it in detail is pretty long).

The idea is basically this: considering we aim at cathing not only linear relationships but also non-linear ones, I'll just train a nn with random values and possible predictors: they are all, of course, normalized into a known range (+1, -1; +10, -10; it doesn't really matter). I train the network with two layers and a number of hidden neurons which is roughly half (and no more than 0.75 in any case) than the inputs number (so to constrict them to ""synthetize"" the information into those inter-neurons). After the training for a specific constant number of epochs I go mesuring the weights of the axones for the wanted inputs for the first and the second layer. I repeat the experiment changing the position of the inputs in the layer and randomizing again the other values.

A non casual predictor will give you definitely a bigger weight. 
You repeat that for all the predictors you are examining: in the end you'll have a list of the more influent VS the less influent AND of the ones having a + sign VS the one having a - sign (which is, imho, massively hugely incredibly important in order to select the final inputs forming a nn).

2015-07-26 18:52:57,"I think the bigger the timeframe the more it'll reflect fundamentals which are near impossible to predict. I usually only see human traders making buck on bigger timeframes because they incorporate more factors than a bot ever could. If you look at the chart, it generates signals( probably on average) every 6 bars (which are intervaled at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, etc.) How would that outcome be if it were at 6:21, 7:21, 8:21, etc? **A LOT** of swings happen in those hours that isn't shown. How the exit strategies work change the outcome as well. 
Here is a more detailed explanation: https://vimeo.com/122492697

Maybe the 'neural network' incorporates it something special but more analyses would have to be done to the strategy concerning this particular market to make me correct. I would not buy this given the lack of clarity on how this works. They would not sell this if worked, maybe a signals subscription or a fund, but no way he'd give away the source code.

I'm not able to find anything by googling the individuals that gave testimonies either. One would think that a hedge fund manager would at least have a linkedin profile.

2015-07-26 16:02:40,"&gt;Thanks for your reply. I want to clear out this point, though, because I've already asked this same question in two other subreddits and all the people came up with this (right, imho) thought: ""if that was so good, it wouldn't be sold"". So, I asked the guy and he said that he's a machine learning student and he hasn't got the economical possibilities to open a non-heavily-leveraged account.

But that's bullshit, which is what I'm saying. The margin on a Brent future is $4600 and your max loss on a gap (ie future opens up down limit on the largest instantaneous gap in history) is under $10k. Given the supposed profitability of his trade and the low drawdown, this is hardly a concern and doesn't require a significant amount of capital. With even a 60k account, he wouldn't even need leverage to have tremendous returns. The total value of a future is under 60k.


&gt;What I'd like to know, though, and this is my question to you and all the experienced people in this subreddit, is: are these results even possible from a pure machine-learning point of view?

Hard to say. Nothing is impossible, but it is extremely implausible and given the shit excuse, I would say it isn't real at all.


&gt;I mean, the guy let me see the indicator through TeamViewer whilst we were on skype. Although everything seemed fine and there were a couple of false signals now and then, everything seemed too good, if you know what I mean.

A Brent future requires under 5k in margin. If the price instaneously went to $0 or doubled with no opportunity to exit, the max pnl is under $60k at these price levels. His claim that it requires too much leverage is an outright lie and a red flag in my eyes. If he is that undercapitalized, I have to wonder what he is doing in his trading in general.

&gt;Considering it is a bit pricey, imho, how could I test it further?

&gt;Thank you.

2015-07-26 14:59:00,"Agreed. Even not knowing anything about the algo, there's the simple fact of, ""why would they sell it if it actually worked?"""
2015-07-26 14:27:41,"They wouldn't be selling it if it worked as effectively as described in forward tests. Hell, a Brent future is very big ($10 every tick). With only 100k in an account, you would be a millionaire very fast if this thing legitimately worked without large drawdowns."
2015-07-26 12:49:49,"Sure. Just look at the definition of correlation. 

correlation(X,Y) = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))] / (sd(X) sd(Y))

where E is the expectations operator and sd(X) = sqrt[(E(X^2 ) – (E(X))^2]

So these things are defined as long as the expectations exist and sd is non-zero for X and Y. There's none of the assumptions that you mentioned about a linear relationship or a normal distribution.

I think perhaps you had a regression in mind where you are trying to ""predict"" Y given X. So something like you have a value of x of random variable X and you want to predict the value of random variable Y.

r(x) = E[Y|X=x] which is the conditional expectation of Y given that X takes the value x. We call r the regression function. But even here none of the assumptions you mention are required. No need for linearity (although you could choose to impose it). No distributional assumptions (like normality) on X or Y. This doesn't even require any assumptions about the direction of casuality."
2015-07-26 08:48:05,"Not a bad suggestion with a caveat that you do lose some granularity from the ranking and outliers don't play into the correlations as much.  That said, it is a good approach since you don't have to worry about the data being normally distributed."
2015-07-26 07:58:10,"I've personally developed a special system: you train a ""vanilla"" MLP, and then you measure the weight coefficient of the neurons for each input.

In this way you not only have a linear understanding (&gt; PCA) of the importance of a particular input in prediction, but you also go beyond the non linear one (&gt; ZCA Whitening).

This is what I currently use and, to me, that works."

If you have some fundamental portfolio theory that you are following, you will need to rebalance at some regular interval, which will inherently take money off the table by selling the biggest winners and buying the losers more.

The predictor has an element of randomness, which is why I can generate a distribution for it on one historic data sample.

As for the second point, that is potentially an issue. I would need to test multiple periods and determine how consistently I can reject the null. I'm not sure how I could combine multiple periods and retain the meaning of the results, so for now I'm stuck with manually comparing the statistics for each historic sample."
2015-07-24 18:15:20,"Ok, thanks.   Sorry it's probably me who's confused.

But next, is your predictor deterministic or does it have some random element?  

I still see it as potentially problematic in that you are comparing your predictor to just one historic time series.  Consider this ridiculous situation: What if your particular historic series was monotonically increasing, and your predictor was just the static prediction ""it's going to go up"".  Now your predictor beats your 100k random null hypotheses hands down, but you have been tricked because the particular historic stock-data you chose was so special.  You only have one historic series, and if this is special then it it doesn't matter how many quadrillion comparison random predictors you choose; you still are tricking yourself.  How can you defend against that?"

FOREX is basically a no-brainer in automated algo trading, unless you are absolutely certain you have a distinct edge in stocks/etfs. To much regulation/manipulation in equities for my taste.

2014-10-28 15:56:39,Thanks for the tips. Why the transition from stocks to currencies?
2014-10-28 15:01:49,"Yep, I'm using the Java API. As usual, the secret is to start simple, just build an automated system that does simple tasks - get current bid/ask, compute something, place order. And then work your way up. The API is pretty transparent and light, but not much documentation. I learned mostly by trial and error. The most challenging aspect is the debugging, since naturally automated trading is an event-driven process, thus sometimes long waiting times for figuring out bugs, depending on your strategy time frame (I'm using 30 min bars).

Modifying the code from currencies to stocks shouldn't be too much of a problem at all (I exactly did the opposite direction earlier this year, stocks-&gt; currencies). If you plan on using only market or limit orders, then there would just be a few lines to change, namely in the Contract object declarations. However, there are a few things to be mindful of in an automated system trading stocks that don't exist in the FOREX world - such as shares available to short, market hours, changing ticker symbols (due to stock split, etc), and so on."

You make sure that you have a sync log replay utility that allows you to fire the transactions back into the system at varying speeds even down to one at a time to check things like locking.

The Erlang thing you mention is more like a step back. Still worthwhile doing as you have to create the transactions somehow. I must admit to being slower and using Python."
2014-10-28 03:04:31,"Interesting question.

If you use their API to run your (self-hosted!) software, nope, they can't - they can just see your ""actions"" (data requests, buy, sell, sl, tl, etc..) and they can just reverse engineer your trading idea starting from those: which is, in the most cases, impossible (of course, if your trading idea is very very simple they can do that successfully, but I highly doubt a very obvious trading idea to be so profitable to require the efforts of reverse engineering).

Things could be (in my humble opinion) VERY different if you use MT4/MT5. Why? Because its russian commented code is NOT opensource. You cannot really say what their software is transmitting, can you? That's one of the gazillion reasons why I do not advise its use.

A user called ""stockpeer"" wrote before me: ""Lastly, why do you care? I can't think of any algo in the world where if someone else ran the same thing they could trade better than you (with the exception of HFT).""

You'd care in order to do not speed up 'market resistance'. Which is a bit like antibiotic resistance in biology. 
If you always get antibiotics just everytime you feel a little cold, eventually that antibiotic class won't work anymore because only mutated bacteria will replicate. 
Market, let's say forex for example, it's a well known sum-zero game: if I am making money, necessarily someone else is losing money. Well, for this reason I can't expect to use the same algorithm and always make money: people will start to react (i.e. to change THEIR algorithm). At that point my algorithm won't work anymore.
So, the more money are invested using my algorithm (for example if lots of people start to use my algorithm), the quicker is the decay of its proficiency. Hence why you should care about other people stealing your ideas.

Just my two cents.

Are you even employed in the industry anymore? Or are you now a ~~""consultant""~~ unemployed?

Wait, is this whole blog thing a ploy to get another job somewhere? Ha!

&gt; Next thing, FYI, in the North American Exchanges, the exchange does not compensate in terms of cash but by other means like trade execution advantages etc.

Flying fuck... that's the point. You said DMMs were compensated for their ""losses"" by the exchange. The exchange doesn't compensate them one bit for losses. It doesn't happen. What you wrote was incorrect. Period.

In my last post, I just told you how DMMs will even pay the exchange (which would be the opposite of being compensated,) for the order flow advantages they get. So you can't regurgitate that fact back to me now like it's some profound bit of insight that backs up your argument. Try harder.

I don't even care that the NSE would pay liquidity providers cash. Even if that's the case, the NSE would be doing so to compensate the LP's for their 'services', NOT when they incur a loss. It would still be on the LP to cover losses and run a market making business that aims to capture profit from order flow, not rely on exchange compensation alone.

Just to clarify, the tick data is available in a database for yesterday and previous dates only. If I want today's data I can only get secondly (or maybe up to 4 times a second) updates.

Tick data comes at a high frequency, and I'm sure there are many cases where the hardware/infrastructure of the consumer simply can not keep up.  As the data comes in FIFO, you'll likely receive the data in bursts causing a variant of your situation.

It would only be a bad idea if you neglect your constraints.  Just keep in mind your latency, and I'm sure you'll be able to develop and backtest strategies.  High resolution data at a second delay's better than one second bar data given per second.  cdpaper's right too, if you ever want to work with second resolution data, just aggregate the data.

Just be extra careful not to allow your algorithms to get ahead of the data.  A common problem when back testing in your situation is that a part of your calculation may have look-ahead bias."

2017-06-02 16:29:05,"Just because the vast majority of  bots written are making use of rudimentary modelling techniques does not imply that the toolchains are not helpful in modeling asset, commodity, forex, and derivatives pricing models.

With respect to the signal analysis bits, I don't use FFTs to try to model stochastic processes. But an understanding of Pontryagin duality is particularly helpful for understanding the Fourier transform from which other tools such as the fast wavelet transform are easily understood through analogy... tools which can be very useful in *clustering* signals for input into machine learning models. Other concepts such as finding cointegrated clusters and exploiting them using additional modeling can be helpful as well--and while those are easily explained intuitively as 'drunkards dog walk' it seems relevant to talk about the Ito and Malliavin calculii used in variational modeling when OP asked specifically for the mathematical methods.

You might find more useful answers by reducing the scope of your question.  Right now, you're just asking about ""trading"", which is a *huge* topic.  Try picking a more specific topic to focus on, then the relevant math will become more apparent.

For example, are you just trying to ask straightforward questions, like how to calculate profit/loss?  position sizing?  synthetic position creation?   ...all of these types of things are well-understood and have straightforward answers.  But if you're asking more advanced things, like how to make predictions or how to create a trading system, then the answers will be much more ""fuzzy"" and more advanced math will be required."
2017-06-02 10:19:46,Gotta start somewhere somehow eh
2017-06-02 10:06:15,"""The"" mathematics isn't really well defined.

Most stat arb stuff is going to make use of lots of different types of models and machine learning.

The sort of large groups are signal analysis, statistics, machine learning.

If you want a solid mathematical background your list is going to go (more or less in order):

Differential Calculus

Univariate Integral Calculus (ODEs here as well)

Multivariate Calculus (PDEs here as well)

Linear Algebra somewhere around here.

Real and Complex analysis (this is where you get the measure theory)

Numerical Analysis (if you give a shit about implementation and convergence rates for numerical algorithms)

I prefer Signal Analysis (Fourier and wavelet stuff) here because the definitions via characters is more rigorous and after a numerical and linear course the DFT and FFT will be trivial

Measure Theoretic Probability

Stochastic Calculus

Stochastic Differential Equations

Frequentist Statistics

Bayesian Statistics

And take some machine learning (ANNs, K-means, clustering, hierarchical models, decision trees, etc) along the way somewhere.

While it is true that most models people use in their trading bots are fairly simplistic, the ones that really beat the market make use of quite a bit of fast, online, numerically optimized machine learning techniques. These take a long time to develop, and care is taken to ensure that they do not signal too much of their strategy to the market to ensure they can run for a long time if they are not disruptive, otherwise they are used for massive amounts and burn out quickly as people discover what they can do. This is why the large firms pay so much ($300k, $500k] for this kind of a thing and people who have mastered these topics (typically masters or phd applied maths, physics, electrical engineering, or computer science students) are in such demand.

Anyway. If you look, all of this mathematics is available in decent literature, it is not particularly new, but the tractability of computation is relatively recent.

As a good start to actually understanding foundational mathematics, I typically recommend Abbott's book 'Understanding Analysis' followed by Rudin's ""Real and Complex Analysis"". That will give you a particularly strong basis in foundational mathematics which should allow you to learn the rest fairly easily.

As for portfolio optimization etc, you've got

Linear Optimization

Convex Optimization (Boyds book is good)

Combinatorial Optimization (Papadimitriou's book is my favourite)

and finally some course in Stochastic Optimization.

All of this comes down, of course to some sense of financial engineering and risk management; but you get the idea.

Each of these financial instruments has different behaviour and require significant modelling effort if you want to be shaving pennies. (This is why most banks do not seem to do much of this at all for their smaller clients. They just have a few pre computed packages they try to shove everyone into at various risk levels.)"

Of course I believe the `backtrader` API and usage to be superior to those of `Quantopian`/ `QuantConnect`, but it is obvious that the integration in a service with data sources (some free/some paid), the backup of a company/customer support and an on-line platform are great advantages for those not willing to set up something of their own.

That does make it more complicated, and you'll need to calculate it yourself.  PEG's numerator is the P/E ratio, the denominator is expected growth.  Expected growth rate is, of course, a subjective measure.  Quantopian has a couple different possibilities.  One is to use the company's own growth guidance, which we have since 2007 (https://www.quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/earnings_guidance)  and another is to use earnings estimate data from Zacks (https://www.quantopian.com/data/zacks/earnings_surprises)

I do agree that the PEG isn't as straightforward as I thought it was.  I'll be surprised, though, if you can find a broader, cleaner, dataset than what we're providing.

Most of the data you are looking for (income, PE, PEG, revenue, etc.) is available on Quantopian for free, all the way back to 2002.  Those fields are all in the corporate fundamental dataset we have from Morningstar.  You can see the list of available fundamental fields here. https://www.quantopian.com/help/fundamentals  There shouldn't be anything tricky about including them in your research.  (As you know, Quantopian also provides price and volume data from 2002, plus dozens of other data sets including Twitter sentiment, earnings surprises, etc. (www.quantopian.com/data)). 

Several of the suggestions you got here say ""do it yourself.""  That's definitely possible, but it's a real pain.  If you DIY, will you get good historical data, that is free of survivor bias?  Will your data be integrated on a security master, or will you have to do all the symbol matching (and symbol changes, and IPOs, spinoffs, and mergers) by yourself?  Quantopian is offering all of that data, for free, and already cleaned.

More than the data, we also provide you with a research environment (Jupyter based) for you to analyze the data.  We've built it so that you can slice and dice all of the data so that you can find the ""edge"" or alpha needed to write a profitable algorithm.

I'd also like to note that on Quantopian, you own your intellectual property (IP).  It's yours, and it's secret. "

2017-06-01 11:00:27,"&gt; I can tolerate seconds of latency

In the nicest way I can say this: if you can tolerate entire seconds of latency, your strategy is not latency sensitive. I suggest you research networking and compilers to learn more about this."
2017-06-01 10:58:41,"I'll try to answer each of your questions:

&gt; What can I do with those unofficial Robinhood APIs on Github? Do I need to download one and use a backend app to interact with it to execute trades?

This is the wrong question. You really don't want to use an unofficial API for a trading algorithm. It would be fine for collecting data, but from a risk perspective you shouldn't be executing *anything* on an unofficial or private API that is not explicitly designed to be used the way you want to use it.

I took a glance through the GitHub projects that have documentation and clients for Robinhood's API. That API is private, in the sense that it looks like they reversed it from the mobile app. If you're not *very careful* in the way you execute orders using this API, they will immediately know it's being used outside the context of a mobile app and probably react. 

Reverse engineering and using private APIs is something I do professionally, and the best thing I can say about it is that even if you are very good at staying under the radar, private APIs are prone to unannounced changes at pretty much any time. It would be very bad for the API change to be deployed to production while you were live trading during the day - having it break overnight is kind of a best case scenario here.

So, in answer: you can do a lot, but it's not reliable enough for risk management.

&gt; If a backend app is needed, how should I go about learning how to build one? Or would it be easier to use existing ones? What are the pros and cons? I am considering Quantconnect/Lean because of the free tick data.

You would need a ""backend"", yes; realistically, this would be an event-driven networking server. If you're already working with Python, you could use something like Twisted in combination with the Requests package for producing and consuming data across the API. This and a database would be a bare minimum setup.

&gt; Since Quantconnect doesn't work with Robinhood API, I was wondering if Lean can be used as a backend app at all. If it can't, is Zipline from Quantopian a viable alternative?

I'm having trouble following this exactly; I think you're saying you want to integrate Robinhood's API and QuantConnect's Lean trading engine. You can do that, but that's honestly a weird way to do this. Lean is developed in (IIRC) C# and is very heavy. But it's fully self-managed. You could use Lean and pipe the requests into a queue to be fired off through the Robinhood API. You might have to get your hands dirty with C# and Python integration, but you can do this. It's all self-managed software.

&gt; Where do I source real time quotes for live trading now that Yahoo is not working any more? Should I consider learning how to scrape data from other websites or buy data? How do I use that data on the backend app for live trading?

You need to start by defining what time resolution you require for your trading strategy. Yahoo never offered real time data (IIRC it was always delayed by 20 minutes) and it doesn't display anything other than quotes. You're not getting order book or tick by tick data from there."

2017-06-01 10:55:32,"I can tolerate seconds of latency, my gut feeling is that RH and python won't be too much of an issue though I could be wrong"
2017-06-01 10:53:30,"Honestly, any algorithm you're running off your own computer using Robinhood will have too much latency to have any real effect. I'm not an expert on HFT, but I do know that it requires significant hardware and software expertise to get that kind of edge. "
2017-06-01 10:51:45,"Another good reason it might be better to wait for official API, thanks for sharing"
2017-06-01 10:50:32,"I guess when it comes to latency it's all relative, I believe RH and Python have good enough execution speed for my strategy because I don't have hundreds of lines of code to run each time"
2017-06-01 10:49:47,"+1 Robinhood's order execution will destroy any latency advantage you have. Also, unless you're doing some tricky stuff to make python run fast, it'll be too slow to give any real latency advantages."
2017-06-01 10:43:24,"Without going into detail about your actual methodology, can you explain why you're considering Robinhood for a latency-sensitive strategy? I'm also interested in hearing why you're going with Python, instead of e.g. Java or C++."
2017-06-01 10:40:30,"The other thing you really want to be careful of is ""unofficial"" APIs becoming deprecated or broken (intentionally or otherwise) when a company makes a change.

I reverse engineer mobile applications to access private APIs and it's very common for APIs to break - a feature you were relying on might disappear, the request signing algorithm could be changed, etc."

&gt;**Abstract:**     
&gt;Using internet traffic patterns at the SEC EDGAR website, we show that firms appearing in chronologically adjacent searches by the same individual are fundamentally similar on multiple dimensions. In fact, traffic-based peer firms identified by our algorithm significantly outperform peer firms based on six-digit GICS industry grouping in explaining cross-sectional variations in base firms’ stock returns, valuation multiples, forecasted and realized growth rates, research and development expenditures, and various other key financial ratios. Our results highlight the usefulness of EDGAR data, as well as the latent intelligence in search traffic patterns. "
2012-11-06 09:03:11,"I think that rather proves my point. The paper that OP references uses data from 1963~2009, and finds high vol outperforming. Blitz &amp; van Vliet use 1985~2006, and find low vol outperforming. My quick study used 2001~2012, and finds high vol outperforming.

So if an ""anomaly"" throws up completely contradictory results for different start and end dates, and can fail dramatically for well over a decade, then are we really looking at a return factor here? Or are we looking at a cyclical risk factor? I'm leaning towards the latter."
2012-11-06 05:08:59,"I would counter that the main reason low vol outperforms is low drawdowns, which in the long run lead to higher returns simply because of compounding. A decade isn't enough, and this particular decade may be special. Blitz &amp; Van Vliet (2007) look at 85-06 (an end point which you'd expect to be disadvantageous to the low-volatility effect) and find the top-bottom decile difference to be over 10%."

With regards to the low vol effect, though, here's what I've found: it's extremely dependent on the start and end point. This is the chart for Japan high vol (10) vs Japan low vol (1) for example:
http://imgur.com/LJSA6
Given the 2001 start point and 2012 end point, you could argue that it refutes the ""low vol anomaly"", as high vol has done substantially better. But in 2009, you would have come to the opposite conclusion. You would also have come to the opposite conclusion if you'd started the study in 2006. And before you ask, this is survivor-bias free data I'm using :-)

That said, the MA strategy looks like it works over much of liquid Asia. I'm dubious, as I wrote in my comment below, that you could capture enough post-slippage to make it an interesting strategy however."
2012-11-05 20:52:08,"It's trivial to abuse it though, for example in the case that pianoboy mentions in which the universe of investable assets is forward-looking.

And I find a mistake of that type more plausible than simple mathematical error, because the results are clearly incorrect; as I'm sure you are aware, the low volatility effect is very strong in every equity market in the world."
2012-11-05 20:15:52,"No problem.

1. Data from 2001 to present
2. As per the paper - buy/sell the whole decile when it crosses the MA
3. Liquid equities only (i.e. trades a couple of million dollars or more per day)
"
2012-11-05 20:01:43,"No, this isn't it. The selling point of the CRSP database is that it is survivor bias free, in that it includes all delistings."
2012-11-05 18:20:16,haha awesome! i'm glad you posted independently. i felt like i have asked too much from this community already!
2012-11-05 12:38:08,"According to their methodology, each year they look at the previous year's data and create portfolios based on the volatility of each stock in that previous year, then trade that portfolio for the year. Next year, they redo this. For any stocks that plummeted / dropped off the radar during a year, they would've lost money on it during that year. I don't think there's survivorship bias when you're rebuilding your portfolio year-by-year like this. Unless they're not counting it as a loss when a stock halts, goes bankrupt, gets delisted before it has a chance to trade lower. 

I guess if their universe of stocks to pick from each year is only defined once upfront based on those currently in the index, then yes, there would be survivorship bias. 

P.S. I probably don't know what I'm talking about."
2012-11-05 12:01:51,"Wow, thanks for all the info!

Questions: 

1) Did you run this only on one year (2001) or over a longer period? 

2) For the MA strategy, for a given decile portfolio, were you buying/selling each stock based on its own individual price &amp; MA or were you buying/selling the portfolio as a whole based on the value &amp; MA of the overall portfolio? (I think they were doing the latter).

3) Did you place any limits on what stocks to include (e.g. minimum price, volume, size)?

Anyway, don't waste any more time looking into this for me. The study just piqued my interest, as I'm always looking for new strategies for early retirement... my selling-naked-options-on-futures strategy hasn't panned out so well for me :)"
2012-11-05 09:42:54,"Asian markets quant here. My initial impression of their paper was that they need to cut down on, or preferably cut out, the amount of crack they're smoking. But I ran their system over Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia liquid universe (from 2001) anyway:


Japan:

* Low decile 4.67% rtn 13.52% vol
* High decile 14.58% rtn 29.46% vol
* MA timing (high decile minus low decile) 40.83% rtn 18.07% vol

Korea

* Low decile 44.60% rtn 50.25% vol
* High decile 4.79% rtn 35.37% vol
* MA timing -13.35% rtn 51.87% vol

Hong Kong

* Low decile 12.53% rtn 15.75% vol
* High decile 49.93% rtn 36.97% vol
* MA timing 46.52% rtn 23.77% vol

Singapore

* Low decile 12.31% rtn 16.81% vol
* High decile 39.58% rtn 44.56% vol
* MA timing 10.31% rtn 30.90% vol

Australia

* Low decile 5.29% rtn 11.58% vol
* High decile 91.56% rtn 35.54% vol
* MA timing 71.95% rtn 24.53% vol

Apart from Korea (the usual crazy standout) you see the same effect they mention in their paper - monotonically increasing returns and (generally) Sharpes across vol deciles from low to high.

So where does this leave us? I'm very dubious that Sharpes of 2 and above are anything like achievable in reality for these strategies. It's late and I don't have time to run the numbers properly against VWAP prices with proper slippages calculations, but a cursory look at the turnover indicates that (assuming 25bp one-way comm + slipp) you can knock at least 20% off the MA timing annualized return numbers. And the high vol stuff is, by definition, going to be messier to get in &amp; out of. So you're down to a 1 Sharpe or so, which is pretty much par for the course for these kinds of things, and distinctly less sexy.

But it does seemingly contradict the low volatility anomaly."
2012-11-05 08:28:26,"I was thinking this too, high vol has two components, upside and downside, this basically filters out the downside..."
2012-11-05 07:03:19,"Survivorship bias perhaps? The more volatile the stocks, the bigger a problem it is."
2012-11-04 18:48:05,the problem is that you get used to the money. worse I have a wife thats used to the money. its really scary to make that move. what i I don't like that either? what then?  I have seriously considered becoming an actuary 
2012-11-04 18:35:44,"You got me.  Those impressive numbers don't appear anywhere else in the following tables.  ~~Also I tried to see how they did buy and hold from 1963.  Didn't see it explained anywhere.~~  It is amazing how much of an outlier the high rank is.  I wondered if they made an error and added the 9th and the High rank.  That would change the 44.78 to 44.78 - 18.49 = 26.29 and the 60.51 to 60.51 - 37.19 = 23.32.   Those are still numbers that are more than twice what is found in the following tables.  They could have just screwup in that one table.

I like the last page of this [SSRN paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2068535).  Short large cap high beta(SPHB) as a hedge. The smaller the cap the better volatility performs.

2012-11-04 14:49:45,"Thanks - Ha, that would take me a few months :) I just figured I glossed over something and am misinterpreting their figures, since the results seem outlandish.

No, the 20% volatility doesn't explain a 44% average annualized gain over a period of 50 years. That just says it's volatile (of course, since it's the highest volatility portfolio). "
2012-11-04 13:36:28,"Fire up R and quantstrat and replicate their results :P

Best way to understand....

The low vol puzzle is interesting, however their 44 % portfolio has a vol of 20% which probably explains it...

2012-11-03 15:23:52,"Ok, let's clarify things, What is the ""best"" execution price?

For me slippage = price order is generated - price executed?

As unless you're trading large enough size to worry about depth of book where you're probably going to want an average price of book relative to your contract size as your expected executable price.

The reason I asked about holding time is i've seen people try to squeeze  0.001 bps of execution expending months of man effort for long term strategies where those same resources could be allocated to something more profitable.

Typically this is not very close to what the market is trading the thing at. For example, I might think oil should be priced at $88, but the market is trading it at $92. In this case I want to start shorting oil, and I'm going to start selling lots of contracts to do this. Even if the market starts slipping on me to $91.99 or $91.98 I'm going to keep selling. There's no way I'm going to push things all the way down to $88, but I still care about executing with as minimal slippage as possible..."

Its not an issue of computing the speed, its more of a latency issue. Buy limit at 14, would hit the exchange and would execute at 12 as the mkt order would lift the 11 off the book.

A really good HFT would lift the 11 via mkt, and place a limit sell at say 11.99 matching your buy limit @ 14. pocketing the 99cents less commissions.

2012-11-02 17:08:53,"It was more during orientation. They said during various training sessions that the cost of a terminal was $1500/month. Period. No exceptions. Day Trader or large investment bank. No extra fees, no discounts. In reality, there are discounts, and if you use different services like their trading platforms, you do pay extra fees. Its very clear that this is the message they broadcast to their clients, and they want you to stay on message. Same w/ the layoffs. Turns out, people do get laid off from Bberg, despite them jabbering about loyalty, and never having done so, etc. In summary, they push their marketing messages on new hires, and expect you to stay on message. Its not a huge deal, but they aren't up front about it, and many people probably don't even realize that is what they are trying to do when they constantly repeat these things.  

Developers don't pay fees to use the terminal. And it is quite an interesting perk- there is tons of data and research tools to play with. You are forced to use the terminal for everything, and their email systems suck, though they may have improved. This brings up other things I forgot about- you have to swipe in and out at a security desk w/ your bberg badge, which also logs you into the terminal (no badge, they send you home to get it). Everyone can see whether you are in or out, even for lunch. There is a lot of that big brother type stuff there. Your entire terminal history is in a database somewhere. Someone can look up every keystroke you made in the terminal. 

You are also forced to keep a programming daily journal, documenting the days progress. This is strictly enforced through automated systems, and not entering in your journal will alert your manager. 


One interesting thing, which you probably saw, was that they have tvs all over the place (they had 50"" plasmas when I was there ~2005, which was a big deal then) with the real time count of the number of terminals sold that month, and total number of terminals deployed worldwide. Kind of cool to see that kind of transparency in a company, especially since you can pretty much deduce (according to their canon) that the # of terminals * $1500 is their monthly revenue. 

None of these things are all that bad on their own merit, but when you look at them as a whole, they just left a really bad taste in my mouth. "
2012-11-02 16:40:49,"&gt;They use you as a marketer and lie to you during orientation- they told us such things that the cost of a terminal is a flat $1500/month, and they have never laid anyone off, both of which were not true.

What did you mean about the terminal fee? Were you referring to the cost of a terminal for a day trader, or the cost of using their workstations for the developers? In what ways do they use recruits as marketers?

Again, really appreciate you telling me about your experience with BBerg."
2012-11-02 15:50:53,"software development. 

Its just a big adjustment. I went from a place that was mostly 9-6, I had an office, my teammates were friends who I could talk to. BBerg was a 9-7:30+ environment where it seemed everyone was competitive.

There is something about sitting in a trading floor style that is really brutalizing. You might think it leads to increased communication, but I find that it actually decreases actual verbal communication amongst peers because no one wants to disturb one another. 

Here is one thing I can tell you across the financial industry though- job roles are much more important than the company you are at. Most financial firms are pretty similar due to all the company hopping that goes on. There are teams at my large bank that have all gone home by 6:15, while mine is frequently here until 8 or 9pm. 

One other thing I forgot about bberg- the organization is flat, and they don't have titles. Not a huge deal to me really, but it makes it a bit tougher to move around to a higher end role, because no one really knows what you did, and you don't have any promotions to show that you are at least basically competent. Another way to put this, is that employers are going to look at whatever you claimed to be there very skeptically. 

I had a unique experience which left a bad taste in my mouth there which I will tell you about. I met with the hiring manager, we got along famously. We went out the Thursday before I was supposed to start, had steaks, swilled beers and I was really excited to work with someone I got along so great with. Monday morning, I go through orientation, and they bring me to his desk. Ten minutes later, some woman comes up to me, and is like ""hi are you algo_trader?"" And I was like yeah. She then said ""oh wonderful I am Gina, I will be your manager!"" I looked at her and I was like well no actually I thought so and so was going to be my manager. She was like oh well someone quit on friday and he is running that group now. I really felt like a bait and switch pulled on me. It felt a lot like they put a guy in front of me that grew up two towns over that I would really like to sell me, with no intention of me ever working for him. It just felt shitty, and had that not happened, maybe I would have gotten over the lack of privacy and competitiveness. 

Remember that recruiters are in the business of closing deals. Some good ones will help you manage your career, but most just want you to take any offers you get (through them). 

I don't know what kind of pay bump you are looking at, but I can tell you that after 10 years of being in the financial industry, and being in a ""prestigious"" role now, I am not sure I would jump in this industry again. I constantly struggle with finding time to spend with my wife, and I really don't see how I could responsibly have children right now knowing I would be an absentee dad. Keep these things in mind. Maybe I have the wrong idea, but I am guessing your DoD job is a fairly low stress 9-5 type thing. I work with really smart guys, which is great, but that also means that it is that much harder to get noticed and promoted. I feel have hit a glass ceiling right now, as my coworkers are just as smart, but increasingly I want to go home at 7, and they are willing to work until 10 (these are mostly younger single guys that relocated to NY after college and don't have strong friend/family roots in the area. In other words, they have little else to live for other than work). 

"
2012-11-02 15:13:43,"In what capacity did you work for Bloomberg? Was it in software development, or in marketing?

Thank you so much for the response. This is more of what I expected to hear from people who actually worked at Bloomberg. The recruiters make it sound like a great deal, but I know there are some grueling aspects to it.

I have one ace in my pocket. I have a Top Secret security clearance. If Bloomberg turned out to be too much of a sweat shop after working there for a year, then I could take those C/C++ skills I developed and go back to DoD. "

2012-11-02 11:54:21,"When you say ""enough volume to encounter slippage"", how are you measuring that?  The order size is much bigger than the top of the book?  I'm not too knowledgeable, but I think IB has a few different ways to route the order, the SMART routing and directed routing.  You might experiment with several approaches and see which has less slippage."
2012-11-02 10:52:06,"I did a very brief stint at Bloomberg.  It has a very strong culture, almost military-esque. You either mix with it or you don't. They use you as a marketer and lie to you during orientation- they told us such things that the cost of a terminal is a flat $1500/month, and they have never laid anyone off, both of which were not true. Once you leave, you can NEVER go back there. 

It is a bit of a sweatshop. You are expected to work long hours, and get it done NOW when there often seems little reason to other than to make someone's gantt chart (MS Project) look good. You get the unspoken peer pressure not to be the first guy to leave the office. 

Your first six months there are going to be spent getting immersed in their software ecosystem. It is an ecosystem- you are going to have to learn tons of APIs and systems that are specific to their world. There are so many layers that even though gcc is down there somewhere, you are going to have a hard time finding it. 


There is no privacy, this is part of the culture thing. You sit elbow to elbow at a trading floor style desk. Conference rooms are all made of glass. You have to scratch your ass, or make a personal phone call, you are going to have a hard time doing it. 

The upside is that it really is a beautiful office, and they have a well stocked kitchen. The pay was pretty good- I worked there during the boom, and they have a ""cert"" bonus system, where they essentially issue you certs which are like stocks that have a value based on the company performance. I worked there during the boom, and between my offer date and start date, my certs had already increased in value 10%. At that time, you also had the option of not cashing out your certs, and earning a very high interest rate on them- somewhere around 9% iirc. I forget the details but that was a guaranteed rate at the time, not based on company performance. You can also wear what you want. This may seem trivial, but being able to work long hours in comfortable clothing of your choice is nice, as is not having to maintain two wardrobes. Also, being able to go out after work and meet friends without going home and changing or looking odd is a big plus. 

Mixed is that its more of a tech company than a financial one. Most people there leave to go on to tech firms. This might actually be an upside- the financial industry has become a brutal place to work. 

As for the experience, you are going to be forced to lean on BBerg's very heavy infrastructure, and a lot of those skills are only minimally transferable. You might say oh well I can delve into the details and really learn how it works. That all sounds well and good until you have deadlines breathing down your neck, and you really start missing things like watching TV, or having meals with friends, or seeing sunlight in summertime.

I think I would try to get on the trading systems team as that might be as close to algo trading that I can get."

One of the aspects to DoD software/IT engineering is the clearance. I have a Top Secret, and having a TS usually means you have lots of options. It's like a niche inside of the tech niche, so it used to be in high demand. However, if DoD spending gets cut, there will be fewer TS jobs. If you are not actively using your TS, it expires in 2 years. I think that if Obama gets reelected and defense spending continues to be cut back, there will be a lot of TS folks who will have to find work elsewhere. "

Its insane, and exhausting. The hours are fairly long, and everything's gotta be done now. That's said, from a technical perspective, its amazing. Both the Bloomberg app, and the resources available to developers.  I would often joke to friends back then that BB was a 30yr old megafirm that still thought of itself as a startup. That said, take my words with a grain of salt, a lot depends on how customer-facing the team you're on is (closer to customer, higher the pressure and the longer the work hours) also I heard from a former colleague on my old team there that it's better now, but of the 10 people on our team, only he's left, and all but 3 of them have left the company.

In other words, it's a lot more your ability to make use of the math as opposed to your knowledge of it.  From my experience working in this field, that's something that comes more with practice and exposure to the field as opposed to working towards higher and higher levels of math."

But working on raw data is generally pretty unfruitful, so we'd compute things like FFT bands, autocorrelation, and several other features on top of the raw data (up to 600 features, sometimes) and then apply machine learning algorithms that performed feature selection to determine which were the most ""meaningful"".

In some sense, the bajillion technical indicators people swear by could be a similar kind of feature for a feature selection algorithm. Instead of picking a strategy and backtesting it, train your ML algorithm and have it pick the indicators that are most informative to its underlying algorithm (often some combination of boosting with an underlying classifier).

Anyway, just random ideas. I'll get down to trying them someday, and then I'll probably find that everyone does this anyway :)"

You'll run into issues if you try to commit every single tick (a BBWC might make that work too), but if you just gather up data and do bulk writes every couple of seconds, it shouldn't be an issue on adequate hardware.

I figure symbol+date makes for a nice key. Do you store keys/values as text (or even json), or go with binary to save every byte possible?

Do you keep any other structures in Redis beyond just the tick data? Say metadata about which symbols were traded on a given day or whatever?"

I agree, but it depends a lot on the person's skill level. If you already have experience setting one up, it's probably a no-brainer. If you don't, it can be an unnecessarily daunting task and take time away from ""value add"" tasks."
2012-08-25 09:53:40,"IMO relational DBs (i.e. Postgres or SQLite) qualify as super simple, and fetching the data you're interested in will probably be a lot easier than traversing a ton of CSVs. Especially if you're still exploring what data you want. Redis might be too, if you know how to use it.

Other than that, I agree with what you're saying, and probaby won't be testing HDF5 until I have gobs of data."
2012-08-25 09:15:06,"I have no intention of doing HFT, so optimal performance isn't really an issue. The reason I'm attracted to hierarchial storage is that data would be partitioned by default; with a relational db I'll have to work on that as numbers grow large. COTS should be less work than rolling your own, but HDF5 might be a viable option to an rdbms.

I do chuck anything key-value into the NoSQL bin, but I'm leaning towards Redis for my ""live data"". Values acting as full blown mutable data structures feels like an edge compared to load/store -only."

I've seen algo trading platforms set up on the free version of SQL server (with a single CPU and 2gb size limit) with all sorts of hacks to work around those limitations. It worked, so in a business sense it was successful, but a complete lack of planning made the whole project insane.

Besides NoSQL databases you could also look into key-value caching systems like memcached. By this I mean, it's possible to store archival data in an on-disk relational database, and then use something different for whatever you need to have instantly accessible."
2012-08-24 16:43:27,"Maybe he means because they use ""Market with Protection""? I believe you still get filled at market within a certain acceptable range that is determined at the time of the order creation. If the bid/ask moves out of that range then the remaining qty gets auto-converted into a limit order at the min/max of the predetermined range.

I thought it still worked as you described up until the limit conversion is tripped, however."

My algo was scalping micro-breakouts for a handful of ticks, from 5 to 20, so I always used market orders to get in on the breakouts.  Taking 1-2 tick slippage every single trade cut into my profitability, especially when my targets were low.

I ran my algo on two setups, simultaneously, one using Zenfire, one using IB.  IB was consistently (80% of the time) getting 1 tick slippage on the fills.  The only reason why I can surmise this is because IB was either slower at sending the orders from their servers to the exchange, or it was taking the 1 tick difference.

I don't understand the mechanism of how HFT can see my market orders.  If the market orders are going straight to the exchange, unless the market sends out something like a Flash order (which I'm pretty sure they don't), I don't see how HFT has any ability to pick off my 1-lot trade."

IB isn't making a market here, theyre just passing your order type to the exchange.  if you try and buy CLV2 with a market order the algos will fill see that message coming and rip you off.  similarly with a stop-limit, you are not guaranteed to get filled if the market gaps through your limit price.  this will happen with any broker, including DMA.  To think IB is trying to somehow ""screw"" on a listed exchange (OTC FX would obviously be different here)  is just you using the wrong order types/not understanding how the order types work.  

I have never had an issue with IB, although i do not trade OTC FX, but my orders have always been filled right where I would expect them.  Of course I never use Market orders, as anyone familiar with Knight Captial should know: no one should."

When I trade any futures contract, I was forced to switch from market to stop limit orders because I **always** got at least 1 tick slippage.  With Zenfire I rarely got this problem.  The problem with stop limit and IB is that sometimes I miss my trades in fast markets, which also sucks.

Their margins are also higher than other brokerages, but it also means they are safer that MF Global, etc.  You can also trade around the world through IB.

I suggest a framework like Ninjatrader that handles all the details with orders for you.  It's not perfect but it's decent, but also expensive.  Depending on how serious you are, it might be worth it."

yes.

Something that worked in the past is often doomed not to work in the future.  If I gave you 5 years of data from 1996-2001, you would probably put a large portion of your equity portfolio in technology and software stocks, only to lose it all in the dot-com crash.  The key for longer term (equity) investments is finding companies that you think will be in it for the long haul, and have healthy balance sheets and dividends.  This strategy is keeping in mind that you're a passive investor.

&gt;how do you justify buying bonds in an environment like today ?

Generally speaking, algorithmic trades are not executed with the long-term in mind (i.e. retirement).  You *can* justify buying bonds in this environment if you think we're doomed to another crash and/or slow deflation for an extended period of time, like Japan."

If my accuracy is K%, the payout is P% and I'm bidding X, then a correct guess contributes K * P * X to my expected gain and an incorrect contributes -(1 - K) * X to my expected gain. It'll break even when K * P * X = (1 - K) * X, or when K = 1 / (1 + P). This means that if the payout is 80%, then I'd break even at an accuracy of 1 / (1+0.8) = 55%.

It's important to remember that models are not perfect descriptors of systems though and complicated systems such as financial markets are unlikely to be wholly described by one single type of model, these will always just be approximations of behavior.

Side note, I found learning C# and Python simultaneously helped me. I did not want to do this, but I needed to in order to see which platform to use.

2016-05-16 22:18:14,"Sort of, though I definitely appreciate your response. It kind of makes me realize it really could be that simple.

The issue that I'm facing is that it seems the rank(x) function is only taking one element as the argument and is therefore unable to hold its set as reference. After all, how could you define the range of that set? Do you just reference the superset?

Another issue is that it references cross-sectional rank; if we were just comparing elements of a given sample, why did they use cross-sectional as a qualifier?

So one of the strategies was = -1 * correlation(rank(open), rank(volume), 5) where the last argument is over the last n days. This would make sense if the rank function could somehow know it should be ranking the open/volume values over the last 5 days but it doesn't.


"
2016-05-16 21:51:57,"So, the idea is that you're just trying to compare all of the values of all the securities at a given time.  You want to make sure that you're dealing with elements of the same scale, so the easiest thing to do is to shift to a proxy for the values -- for example the rank of that item.  That boils down to sorting the values and then picking the index that it lands on as its rank.  Some systems do more complicated math when there's a tie - summing together the ranks of all the elements with the same value, and then assigning the average rank to all of them.

eg:


given the following (made up) opens for 

|| IBM | GOOG | AAPL |
|---|---|---|---|
|price| 57.00 | 600.00 | 90.00 |
|rank| 3 | 1 | 2 |

Or if IBM and AAPL were tied (without the averaging)

|IBM|GOOG|AAPL|
|---|---|---|
|90|600|90|
|2| 1| 3|

or with averaging:

|IBM|GOOG|AAPL|
|---|---|---|
|90|600|90|
|2.5| 1| 2.5|

Does that help?"

Having said that, you can see on the graph that the SL lines are (mostly) like a human has placed them - they are on pivotal point. "

2016-05-14 16:09:44,"So the alternative is...? To just go in blind? The equity curve isn't the be-all-end-all, but if your strategy fails in backtesting, it'll most certainly fail in deployment. There's no guarantee that an anomaly will persist (some are even making the case that momentum is finally dying), but if your options are A) backtest B) deploy and cross your fingers, there's no contest."

2016-05-14 14:37:08,"&gt; My initial idea was based on k-means (which is great for 1D timeseries) but the results were not really interesting. What I really like in MeanShift is that it is used a lot in image recognition software. It literally creates ""lines"" around objects and that was exactly want I wanted.

Like I said I don't know much about this subject.  How was the chart you presented different from KDE?  I just saw the lines on the groups.  Am I jumping the gun here because you're going to cover it more in the future?

2016-05-14 14:27:20,"Hello Eric, thanks for reading!

My main goal was to do a slow intro to machine learning and how easy is to utilize ML to calculate S/R lines. In the next posts I'll dive more into ML and my focus is how you can optimize your trading.

I looked around and I didn't find anyone attempting this, probably because it is difficult to identify ""how"" to use ML to identify S/R - or maybe it is too boring.

My initial idea was based on k-means but the results were not really interesting. What I really like in MeanShift is that it is used a lot in image recognition software. It literally creates ""lines"" around objects and that was exactly want I wanted. I might do another take using KDE.

Regarding why I wanted to visually confirm S/L is because placing S/L is very subjective. There is no easy way to verify that these are actual line unless you have a backtesting system (or a human to visually confirm) that creates positives. But again, backtesting doesn't say much. 

Regarding the specific settings and what is more important how these lines work in the past or in the future, I have another post dedicated to this. What is really surprising is that price really reacts to technicals and that higher timeframes give you cleaner S/L.

2016-08-25 10:13:35,"My first advice would be to walk away. If you're determined enough to ignore what I just said, and determined enough to go years, maybe your entire lifetime, trying to find a profitable pattern, then try it. I do  think that you probably at a massive time disadvantage. Most profitable traders I know took years of just dedicating themselves to trading as their only job to find their profitable pattern. Maybe you can with a full-time job, but is it likely, probably not. 

Also, there is no need to backtest with money. The entire point of backtesting is so that you can eliminate unprofitable patterns without losing money. You need to backtest first, then paper trade (trading live without money) for a month or so, to determine whether your algorithm is profitable. Only then should you start putting money. This is so you do not have to waste money figuring out whether your algorithm is profitable. Anyways good luck. You'll need it. "

2016-08-24 08:42:11,not if its unprofitable because of slippage/trading costs/clearing costs.
2016-08-24 08:03:30,"Trading costs always have the same sign, so it's possible you still lose money even if you flip the sign on your consistent losing strategy."
2016-08-24 02:25:30,The opposite of random is random.
2016-08-23 21:02:29,"A few ways to lose money that aren't reversible:

1) if you're actively trading (crossing the bid/ask spread) you have to cover the cost of the spread

2) if you're passively trading (waiting for others to trade with your orders) you have to cover the cost of adverse selection

3) there are trading fees

4) If you trade with too big of a size too aggressively you'll push the market as you execute and it'll relax back towards the original price against your position.  You cannot just trade the opposite way since your trading has had an effect on the market.

5) there are market participants who ""spoof"" the market with fake interest in attempts to trick traders into making mistakes.  Reverse the direction of your inputs the next day and they could continue to trick you just at different times in different ways.

So yeah, if you're very confident you have predictive power but for some crazy reason (maybe a typo?) you accidentally reversed your trading direction then yeah, switch it around.  But if you lost money consistently in the past it wasn't necessarily b/c you just needed to flip your sign."
2016-08-23 20:43:12,"Why don't you share it here? If you need to backtest it before knowing whether it works then you're not giving up much. Think of it as a lesson. I am sure someone, if it is reasonable, will be willing to translate it into code for you. Myself included."
2016-08-23 17:40:37,Thanks for saving me the time to read this.
2016-08-23 17:22:23,So... an ad. Great.
2016-08-23 16:18:30,"Lets assume transaction costs and execution costs are eliminated, which would traditionally be the source of continued drawdowns even when the opposite is imposed.

What your left with is a strategy that consistently makes money.  If you can define why your edge exists, the better off your profitabiliity will be and the more confident you will be.  If you cannot define why the edge exists, then you definitely won't know when to turn off the algo or adjust its parameters.

As an algo trader, you're still trading using discretion despite the fact that execution is algorithmic.  So the risk in doing the opposite of a losing strategy is not so much that the approach cannot make money, but rather you won't have edge in trading the algo which is trading an instrument.  Imagine you suffer a drawdown larger than your max drawdown from your backtest, you stop the algo, and afterwards it has a huge run-up.  This is very similar to people who sold out of equities after the GFC.  The question I'd ask is whether you'd be more confident leaving your money indefinitely in long equities during a drawdown or an algo that is likely overfit and you have some healthy skepticism about.

Without a technological edge, a strong fundamental knowledge of trading with real capital, and/or extremely low transaction costs, the odds that an edge is big enough to be extracted indefinitely is virtually none.  Thus, as I've said before, you're going to be trading your algos, and understanding why they're working or not working will be the ultimate difference between success and failure."

2016-08-23 15:07:17,"How about a TL;DW?
"
2016-08-23 13:08:39,"Instead of asking, why dont you go ahead and just try it out.

get some data, throw up some TA indicators, watch it lose a lot of money in a backtest, then reverse the long/short signals and watch it keep losing a lot of money...

you might actually learn something about trading that way, besides the programming language use of course...

theres also commissions, which depending on your strategy could be a huge factor in dragging your profit down irrespective of whether its a profitable strategy either way.

"
2016-08-23 12:35:36,"Finding a way to consistently lose money is as hard as finding the opposite. Most strategies will either make money now and lose it later or lose money now and recover it later. The whole problem with this is that you need to know when ""later"" starts.

This is why backtests are so deceiving. By justing switching a + with a - (or the other way around) and a losing money strategy becomes a profiting one."
2016-08-23 10:14:02,"There are many different ways to be wrong, it's not a 50:50 thing. So if you do the opposite then you're just doing a ""different wrong""

2016-08-23 08:58:14,Agreed. I take a different approach called black swan trading.
2016-08-23 08:55:53,"That's a good question and I've thought about it myself and the answer is still no. The problem in trading is not just guessing the right direction but when to get out as well. You can pick the right direction of a market 80% of the time and still loose money by having everything reverse on you before you took your profits. Also huge swings will mess you up and force you to hit your stops.

For example...code something simple like if the market breaks above point A, buy. Then when this fails, re design and say if market breaks above point A, sell. This will also fail. "
2016-08-23 01:55:32,"Nice, I've looked at Quantconnect but I just decided to just use the Interactive Brokers API.  To be honest I'm not sure what the best route would have been, but its been going pretty well so far.  I've set up a system that runs each of your underlying securities through a series of customizable algo rules before approving or disapproving the trade and moving onto the next security, however I still have to code the exit strategy.  My first strategy I'm trying is focusing on options spreads because that's what I use to trade manually."
2016-08-22 15:13:14,"QuantConnect is a multi-asset internationally focused platform. We support trading in multiple markets simultaneously. All the others are US focused only. We support Python, F# and C#. 

We support Equities, Forex, CFD, Options and soon Futures. We support universe selection (stock picking) with MorningStar fundamental data as well.

Our data is at Tick, Second, Minute, Hour and Daily for Equities, FX, Futures.  Options data is minute resolution only at the moment for computing practicality reasons.

A key difference is that we are a radically open source infrastructure focused company. We don't profit from strategies like all the others. We open source the brokerage adapters, data adapters and GUI's for trading on your own servers. You don't need to use us. Because we don't profit from the strategies we don't care if you trade with us or on your own servers. The reality is if you have a good strategy you can walk into any hedge-fund and raise capital in a day. We want to enable you to do that.

We're also currently charging $20/mo for live trading but that will soon be free as well if you're live trading on a brokerage (who will pay it for you).

The first post is a little cynical; we provide ticks from all exchanges, there's no throttling :D. We build all our data from ticks; filtering out un-tradable ones (off exchange, delayed reporting). There's a lot of work which goes into keeping a data-library clean but we do that for you.

We also just launched a way to download free FX/CFD data for FXCM and Oanda. Pre-packaged and ready to use in LEAN. You can see that here: https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/1314/feature-free-download-of-fxcm-and-oanda-data/p1

2016-08-22 14:29:14,"Coding a pattern takes a lot of work, along with coding the backtests. You'd have to give the coder some kind of incentive either in the form of payment, or showing them a code that is profitable, which they in turn can use/split profits with you.  If you're just trying it out, without knowing how ahead of time how profitable it is, then it'd be much quicker to learn to code yourself, as you'd be hard pressed to find someone to give help (thinking 5 hours of pure coding at the very least).

2016-08-22 13:37:51,"Designing moving averages is a fun exercise, but I've never seen a strategy that would be significantly improved by replacing a simple average with some more fancy construction. Most seem to seek to reduce ""lag"" without specifying what lag is or why it is bad. "

you can for example be a quant researcher and publish models that have theoretical returns, algotrading will also involve actually implementing those models.  some firms segment the two, some down.  etc."

Might depend on what assets you are trading and frequency though. 

"
2016-08-19 00:33:17,"As someone that's done this as the trader, algo trader, and as the investor:

They open an account that grants you limited power of attorney. The broker has facilities to give you limited access, so you can't abscond with the funds. Any additional agreement between you such as your payment arrangement can be done outside of any forms the broker gives you, if the broker expects you to have a license - but this part still needs to be clear.

And finally, in the US there are ways around needing a license if a computer is trading. If at any point you need to direct the algorithm to trade a particular thing, then you probably need a license. If there was any way for the investor to just subscribe to your algorithm, then you wouldn't need a license."

Unless you want to give it a go for real, in which case, that bankroll better be pretty big and you'd better be pretty sure it'll work over a period longer than the current regime...

I'd say of all these ideas, it'd be better to license the software to the person.  You can set up an LLC, declare the business to compliance (i.e. Software that you license) and get paid a licensing fee.

2016-08-18 13:59:32,"Thanks for giving me credit. : )

Since both HMA and DMA are plotted in green there, it's hard for me to figure out which one is which in the chart. I'd think that since the DMA is the instantaneous average of Zero Lag and HMA, it would always sit at the midpoint between the two, but I don't see either green line doing that. Or perhaps you should feed the DMA the same value that you gave to the HMA, which is 30 instead of 7. I dunno. I didn't do too much with it just yet."

&gt; Exemptions From Registration

&gt;A person or firm meeting the definition of investment adviser in Section 202(a)(11) does not need to register with the Commission if the person or firm qualifies for one of the exemptions from registration set forth in Section 203(b) of the Advisers Act. Investment advisers exempt from registration under Section 203(b) are still subject to certain anti-fraud provisions included in Section 206 of the Advisers Act. For more information on anti-fraud provisions, refer to the discussion below under ""Anti-Fraud Provisions.""
Section 203(b) of the Advisers Act provides five limited exemptions from registration. Section 203(b)(1) exempts any adviser (1) all of whose clients are within the same state as the adviser's principal business office, and (2) that does not provide advice or issue reports about securities listed on any national securities exchange. Section 203(b)(2) exempts advisers whose only clients are insurance companies. Section 203(b)(3) exempts any adviser that: (1) during the previous twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients; (2) does not hold itself out generally to the public as an investment adviser; and (3) does not act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company or business development company. Rule 203(b)(3)-1 under the Advisers Act provides guidance on how to count clients when determining eligibility for this exemption. In determining if a person or firm holds himself or itself out as an investment adviser within the meaning of Section 203(b)(3), the Division looks at a number of factors, including, for example, whether the person or firm advertises; refers to himself or itself as an ""investment adviser""; maintains a listing as an investment adviser in a telephone, business, building, or other directory; expresses a willingness to accept new advisory clients; or uses letterhead indicating any investment advisory activity. Section 203(b)(4) generally exempts any adviser that (1) is a charitable organization, or is employed by a charitable organization, and (2) provides advice, analyses, or reports only to charitable organizations, or to funds operated for charitable purposes. Section 203(b)(5) exempts advisers to church employee pension plans.

2016-08-18 00:23:15,"Is your model automatically derived/trained from the data? Or did you analyse the data and come up with it manually?

If it's the former, you could create a new model using 75-80% of the data and test on the remaining 20-25%, and then repeat this process many times for different train/test set splits to obtain a performance probability distribution/average etc.

If it's the latter.. I got nothing. Besides paper trading it going forward.

I don't think randomly shuffling time-series data is a great idea. Do it at a high granularity and temporal relationships are affected; do it at a low granularity and you end up testing on unaltered chunks of the training set, which is a *really* bad idea.

2016-08-17 01:18:34,I've been working on a system for another platform but would love to get it rolling with IB. Have you been using sometime like Quantconnect? I've been using my own data so far but love their website.
2016-08-17 00:45:57,"In spite of still lack of formatting a couple of things are clear:

  - You don't query IB to find out which is the the 1st ""order id"" to use. This is in most cases not relevant, but having a fixed point at 303 is for sure not the way to go: check `nextValidId`

In any case:

  - You are not setting `m_orderId` to the *order id* you are calculating. Being this the most likely culprit.

Others:

  - Not setting `m_tif`. The docs from *IB* are unclear on this and the order type in your case is `MKT` so it should not play a role. But even if it doesn't seem obvious your market order may not be *immediately* executed. Set it to `GTC` (*Good Til Canceled*)

  - The most correct approach to get the `Contract` is to create one manually just like you did and query the `contractDetails`. If there is only one specification you can even use the returned `Contract` object which contains many additional filled and identifying traits like a unique market identifier for the contract. It may also be the case that you get several answers for a single specification. That means that your manual specification is not specific enough. For example: `AAPL` trades in different currencies and this needs to be cleared. The `DAX` futures, given the addition of the `Mini-DAX` needs to go down to the *multiplier*.

And finally:

  - `IbPy` (because of the nature of the *IB* API and the socket connection) is an event based system. It may not seem obvious either, but being out the loop doesn't mean that your `placeOrder` actions have generated a call from your app to `TWS` and/or from `TWS` to the server. The `disconnect` (or the implicit exit after it) are killing any existing socket connections and this may in turn kill any existing pending order queues. If you are not going to program using events, place at least a `time.sleep` before the `disconnect` to give some leeway to the system to send the commands and receive the events.

2016-08-16 15:19:14,"You are describing a multi-peaked event, which is either:

1. a mistaken result of either too little data, or a mistake in analyzing that data, OR

2. the combined effects of two local ""maxima"" (ideal trading situations). 

Imagine for simplicity's sake that investors fell into two major groups: those that read the news online, and those that listened to it while travelling home from work. Those that listen online will react in about an hour's time to bad news, and sell their stock in Midwestern Grain, Ltd, after hearing about a big tornado destroying the corn crop. The other group will put in their sells after the market closes, and (over time, on average) do this about four hours after the news hits.

There will be two peaks in sales: one at 60 minutes after any disaster (on average), and one at 240 minutes afterwards.

Obviously, this analogy is very rough, but the point is: there are two completely separate groups of sales happening on the same information, and they both will have broad, gaussian-like shapes (not all sales at once, even within a single group). The overlap of these two groups suggests the price will drop (from overselling) twice, providing two excellent sale periods: before one hour, and before four hours. In fact, *buying* at two hours post-disaster and *selling* at three hours might even work - on average.

So, that rough idea can explain why this dual hump in your results can exist. The actual ""why"" of it isn't really important - and you can argue yourself into believing a false reason, if you want one badly enough, which is worse than no reason at all.

So, either trust the numbers (after rechecking them!!!), or don't. I trust the numbers; I'm an algo trader."

In that case and since you have assigned `ec` and `ema` a value of `0` during the declaration, the initial seeding value is effectively `0` the 1st time the `_DMA`is calculated.

It's not an ideal choice, but it's a choice and the difference with other seeding choices will be smoothed out after some bars.

Things like the arbitrary `MaxBarsBack` is what pushed me into developing my own platform to make sure such a thing is calculated automatically and depending on the indicators in use.

I will be adding (hopefully today) your Moving average to the arsenal of moving averages available in my platform. My choice for a seed will be different for `ec` (because `EMA` already features the usual choice of an `SMA` seed), but I will try to let it be open via a parameter.

""Exponential"" is something I have practiced a bit more and ""0"" seems a rather odd choice for a seed value.

Your ""ec"" (which I guess stands for ""error correction"") is a modified version of an EMA and as such needs an initial ""seed"" value.

The usual choice with EMAs is to seed them with a Simple Moving Average, i.e: you run a simple moving average for 20 periods and then the EMA calculation takes over. The first ema[1] is the last value of the Simple Moving Average.

Another choice, although less common, for the seed is the previous ""price"" point.

The problem I see with your formulas is, at least for a non-practitioner of EasyLanguage, that one has to make a leap of faith to believe that ec[1] has a sensible value during the first calculation (and the same applies to ema[1])

Of course everything is smoothed out after X additional periods, but there is an initial something which seems to come suddenly out of the blue.

Since you are using Hull's Moving Average and this is the counterpart in the final averaging process with ec, I would opt for using ""hull"" as the initial seed value for ec.

Personally I'd be more worried about a rogue employee stealing IP for his own use than the company selling out my IP to one of the angel investors.  And the former probably doesn't post *that much* risk.  
  
They seem to be geared towards a very specific type of ""large basket, classifier"" based quant strategies anyway - which are probably out of the realm of most individual investment strategies.  So I suppose the safest play would be to stick to those types of strategies on their platform.

* 'crosses below' should ensure that the previous bar's close is &gt; my_average, and this will only evaluate as true when the current bar's close has moved below my_average, so that should be enough for your signal.  Previously posted code won't execute, I believe, since it can't cross above and below on the same bar unless you're evaluating per tick, and I don't think that's the case here.

* If you are in a long position and you sell short, the system will effectively reverse your position.  If you are neutral, you'll open a short, and if you are short, nothing will happen unless you have enabled the ability to open multiple positions in the same direction.  The point being that you shouldn't need to worry about MarketPosition to open a short unless that's part of your strategy, e.g., you need to do some more evaluation on another variable only if you are long.

If you want to figure out a signal happening in a prior period, keep track of it, and then determine a second signal based on that, well it's a matter of keeping track of the first signal in a variable.

So, let's say I want the close to have moved above the average in the last 2 bars, and then a close to move below it, you might do something like:

    var: signal1(0);
    signal1=0;
    if close crosses above my_average signal1=1;
    if average(signal1,2) &gt; 0 and close crosses below my_average then sell short next bar at market;

The last line could be easier to grok if you do:
    if signal1[1] &gt; 0 or signal1[2] &gt; 0 and close crosses below my_average then sell short next bar at market;

It just may be easier to change the length to something longer if you use the average of the last 'n' bars signal1 value.

One way around all this is for your strategy to use limit orders. Then look ahead in your OHLC series to confirm an entry or exit.

If you plan to use HFT strategies, C/C++ is the best choice. For HFT strategies, it is also recommended to build your own execution system. https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Beginners-Guide-to-Quantitative-Trading

Higher level languages are easier to program in (I prefer Python), but apparently these languages are slower (probably on the order of seconds, which doesn't seem like much, but can be major in intense trading situations). If your starting out, it is probably fine to use a higher level language. Another benefit with higher level languages is that there are many platforms that can help you execute your strategies and backtest. You don't really have to set up your own infrastructure.

If your long term goal if HFT (especially ultra high frequency trading), you should probably start practicing with a low level language.

2016-12-02 10:59:02,"I also work at a fund. For one of our strategies, we use our quantitative models for signals and entry timing, but we take trades off when we are content with performance as humans. 

In addition, we have an algo that runs an options based strategy collecting theta on euro style cash based options. In that strategy we do not have to worry about trade exits as we can allow our contracts to expire either profitably or otherwise. Moreover, I am working on a volatility strategy for personal use that just enters allocations and I will be the one skimming profits when I deem necessary. 

I like to have a human hand on the system, because I believe it to be a good form of checks and balances. Also, it makes it so we can't blame poor performance on our quantitative systems. This accountability along with the overall success that we have seen using this method is why I enjoy doing it. But in the end, everyone has their own preferences :) I like to take risk off of the table when we hit 20-30% performance on the year, but everyone has their own goals and aspirations for their performance levels so I can't speak on anyone else's behalf.

2016-12-02 10:03:11,"Yes, I have definitely back tested the strategy -- thousands of iterations to be specific. The results are sort of a wash -- the signals may produce profits in certain types of markets (high volatility range bound) but not in others (low volatility trending). For example, if the strategy says sell when residuals are to high and buy when the residuals are too low (statistically speaking) -- then this will work pretty well in a range bound mean-reverting market. However, the same signal will do poorly in a trending market. A large upward move that precedes a continuation of an upward trend would initiate a sell signal if we use this same signal (we should have bought). The trouble has been to identify the market type to maintain profitability over time."

At the moment you are trading in the company, but the concepts are applicable in any case.

The book elaborates on the importance of ""having"" a system and setting it up and not on which system is the best. One class of systems is the judgmental system aided by computers.

My own trading uses these entry/exit rules:

  - Entry point is judgmental but very strongly guided by the signals of the system

  - Exit point is always discretional (because ""better"" can be a formidable enemy of ""good"" and because in many many occasions in the market. ""less"" is ""more"")

My results tell me my system works (got pals that argue that I could fare even better by not exiting manually ... but I always argue that the situation could also be catastrophic)"

2017-03-08 16:22:00,"Let me know what you think, 

When we made this ea we came up with the idea we wrote it into code. We then used eurusd to gauge some settings, small backtests for example on month of testing. Just to find out which settings worked best. 

Once we had settings we felt were in line with how we wanted it to work we tested it on an entirely different pair for 2 years. (the USDJPY test) After seeing those results we took the same settings and date tested it on AUDUSD and got a similar result.

We then tested it again on eurusd and got another similar result.

I do not think we have been data fitting, We have made an effort to avoid it.

My only concern is that since we have been testing on the same 2 years of data the with usd pairs, That the back tests might be heavily correlated.

Currently testing the same thing on gold, But am going to run some tests on 2008-2009 data and some completely non correlated pairs.

2017-03-08 15:16:41,"You need to define the magnitude of the predictions as well.

Consider an example: you are accurate 69% of the time and average 2 pips per success.  On the 31% of the time that you're inaccurate, you lose 5 pips per failure.

Net equation is: (.69 * 2) + -(.31 * 5) = 1.38 - 1.55 = -.17 per trade

That's before factoring in commissions.  There's other dimensions to consider as well - streakiness of losses and maximum size losses, before you can fully deploy a strategy.

Or do we let spread=price_stock1 - price_stock2 instead and pass this into the ADF. The latter seems like the correct answer, but it runs against what I have seen on some articles online. I just want some clarification in this, since the ADF test returns a significant p-value on the former, but insignificant on the latter."

2017-03-07 18:27:19,"The whole point of pairs trading is that the hedge ratio is in some sense sticky, so that if you buy and sell in the right combination you end up with a synthetic instrument that has a stationary price series. Then you buy that synthetic instrument when it's cheap and sell it when it's expensive.

That only works *if* the combination that you come up with is stationary. Stationarity gives you that sort of what-goes-up-must-come-down-ness of spread, which is the whole point of the strategy.

You can run a linear regression on any two price series and come up with a coefficient, but that doesn't make that coefficient a ""hedge ratio"" in the sense of creating a stationary time series. Your main priority should not be in trying to compute the optimal hedge ratio between two series, but rather in insuring that there is some cointegrating relationship between the two.

Now, maybe the linear relationship between the two series does change over time, and it makes sense to recalibrate your model on some regular time frame. In that case maybe you are computing a new hedge ratio every week or day or hour or something, and trading according to that. But all of that is moot if the two series aren't actually cointegrated.

And if they are cointegrated then I wouldn't expect the hedge ratio to change by all that much on a short time horizon, and the variation in the estimated hedge ratio due to sampling error would likely be higher than the variation of the actual optimal ratio itself. So I stand by my assertion that you're better off finding a strongly cointegrated pair and rounding an approximate hedge ratio (2:1, 3:2, something like that -- although I come from commodities trading so I'm not sure how people do it with stocks) than trying to obtain some optimal estimate that changes every hour.

If you run a regression on two stocks that don't have much to do with each other, you'll basically get a random number. And if you repeat that every week or hour or day you'll end up with a series of meaningless random numbers. You should not use those meaningless random numbers to generate trading signals."
2017-03-07 18:08:08,"That's a good point. I haven't been looking at the significance of the regression coefficients...which I really should. 

&gt;If you're seeing that on one day the hedge ratio is 0.44 and the next day it's 0.55 and the next day it's 0.48 and so on, then probably a convenient thing to do would be to use 0.5 as your hedge ratio.

So in theory, how do dynamic hedge ratios work? I thought the point was to recalculate a hedge ratio each period of time and stick with that new ratio. But doesn't that introduce the problem of your spreads being non-standardized? Or is this not really an issue at all as long as you maintain the same hedge ratio throughout the lifespan of a position and only change ratios once you exit the position?"
2017-03-07 17:17:02,"Well, it's always going to change. In principle, the probability of getting the exact same coefficients out of a linear regression today and tomorrow is zero. If you're seeing that on one day the hedge ratio is 0.44 and the next day it's 0.55 and the next day it's 0.48 and so on, then probably a convenient thing to do would be to use 0.5 as your hedge ratio. Generally you won't be able to use the regression coefficient as a hedge ratio anyway, because you can only buy/sell so many of each stock and they sell in discrete amounts. If the regression implies a ratio of 201940:100000, instead of buying and selling a total of 300,000 shares, probably just use 2:1. 

If you're seeing it jump around a whole lot more than that, and especially from positive to negative and back, then that's a sign that the pair you've identified might not actually be cointegrated at all, or that the stock prices aren't really linearly related. What happens when you plot a scatterplot of the two stock prices over time? If the pair is a good candidate for pairs trading, you should see something that looks roughly like a straight line. If it's not a straight line then this strategy won't work.

Are you paying attention to whether the coefficients that you obtain from the regression are significant?"

2017-03-07 16:30:46,"I see, your explanation makes it really clear to me. I have ran the ADF test on the spread (do tell me if this is wrong) and it gives me a significant p-value. On the other hand, I have run a cointegration test on the stock prices and the p-value is insignificant, so the stock pair I found definitely isn't perfect.

&gt;The other thing you'd like to check is if the spread is mean reverting--after all, that's the whole point. In order to do this, you should obtain a hedge ratio by using a regression, and then check on a test dataset whether the spread price is stationary using something like the augmented dickey-fuller test. This will tell you if there is a significant cointegration between the pair that you find.

So the thing is, I calculate a dynamic hedge ratio that changes each day. Also note that for my implementation, spread = price_stock1 - hedge_ratio * price_stock2. Since the hedge ratio changes every day, the spread calculated every day uses a slightly different hedge ratio. This means that the spread for each day is not standardized throughout time. In other words, the spread price I calculated depends not only on the prices of both stocks, but also on the dynamically changing hedge ratio. Is this a problem (especially when I put this spread through the ADF test)?"

Latency is a huge deal in the industry and firms pay tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the fastest connections.  These connections are usually in the form of fiber optic cable or microwave antennas. Major firms also are usually highly affiliated with certain exchanges CBOT, NYSE, AMEX, BATS, MIAX etc as the exchanges want market share and the firms want their order flow.

To the individual investor/ trader it doesn't matter at all how fast/where your orders are routed.

2017-03-07 14:25:40,"Ah, I see.

&gt;A problem I have found are that the hedge ratios calculated using regressions may actually be negative (for certain periods of time), which is very problematic.

If the hedge ratio is shifting signs from positive to negative, that is a sign that the stocks you've chosen don't have the relationship that you need them to have in order for pairs trading to be sensible.

Let's remember what pairs trading is and why it works (in theory).

We assume that the difference in price between two assets is *constant on average*. Another way to say this is that the pair is *cointegrated*. Hopefully there is some fundamental explanation that we can turn to in order to make this assumption. It takes some fixed quantity of crude oil to make a barrel of heating oil, so we might expect to see a relationship like HO = A + B\*CL + e, where HO is heating oil, CL is crude, A is the fixed cost of turning crude into HO, B is the production ratio of CR to HO, and e is the market doing wacky shit. If HO and CR are a good pair, then the *e* term will have mean 0 and will have the property that it is *mean reverting* or *stationary*, and the coefficients A and B will be relatively constant, at least over short to medium time horizons.

If these assumptions are satisfied, then we have HO - BCR = A + e, where A is a constant number and e is a random variable with mean 0 and finite variance. Then, you can price the spread at A, sell it whenever it goes above A+nσ where n is some parameter you choose, and buy it whenever it goes below A-mσ where m is some other parameter you choose (that might be equal to n), and sigma is the standard deviation of e.

So, the first thing you'd like to do when you identify a candidate pair is to see if the assumptions are satisfied. Now, since you're finding that the coefficients are jumping around (in particular, shifting signs), it seems that the pair you've found does not satisfy the assumptions of the pairs trading model. But suppose you find a more stable pair. The other thing you'd like to check is if the spread is *mean reverting*--after all, that's the whole point. In order to do this, you should obtain a hedge ratio by using a regression, and then check on a test dataset whether the spread price is stationary using something like the [augmented dickey-fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test). This will tell you if there is a significant cointegration between the pair that you find.

&gt;Another problem is that the hedge ratio does not necessarily generate a price neutral long/short strategy (an equal balance of long and short when entering a trade). 

Yeah, that's sort of the point. If you're lucky, you find a pair with a 1-1 ratio and you can be flat on every transaction, but many pairs won't have that property. If you find a pair which is *truly* cointegrated with a hedge ratio of, say, 2, that means that buying 1 of X for every 2 of Y will give you a *risk* neutral portfolio, even if it isn't market neutral.

&gt;Also, do I log the prices of each stock when running the regression?

You can, but then you should use log prices as price signals for your trading strategy as well. Don't use log prices to build your model and then level prices for price signals.

One other thing -- finding a negative ratio doesn't mean that you haven't found a good pair. The important part for pairs trading isn't the ratio but the cointegration. You want to be really really sure that that cointegration exists, and if it does then the ratio doesn't matter. Finding a (stable!) negative hedge ratio just means that the stocks (or whatever) are negatively correlated, so that when one goes up the other goes down. There are certainly plenty of examples of stocks like these that you could imagine. If that is the case, then certainly you don't ever want to be long one and short the other -- you want to be either long or short both. So the strategy will look different from the traditional long/short pairs strategy, but it could still work if the pair is cointegrated."

spread = price_stock1 - hedge_ratio * price_stock2

So basically, I want the hedge ratio to be positive (in my implementation) so I can go long on one stock and short on another.

I am actually also using the Bollinger Bands method (even though I did not know it was called that haha). The time series I used is the spread I calculated using the spread formula above. The problem is, its not as straightforward as doing SecurityA/SecurityB. The hedge ratio of SecurityA/SecurityB always makes sure that your net position is 0 (equal amount of long and short). However, the hedge ratio calculated using OLS/TLS does not ensure this. Most of the times, the hedge ratio results in me having more exposure to a long position or a short position, and I am thinking this is problematic.

What do you think? Does it make sense to stick with the spread using the OLS hedge ratios for the Bollinger Bands calculations, but when entering a position, use SecurityA/SecurityB to calculate the hedge ratio to enter into a market neutral position?"

Wouldn't you want your hedge ratio to be negative? You're likely to be long one security and short the other depending on your expectations of divergence and convergence. I might be misinterpreting how you're using it.

I once did a Pairs Trading implementation that didn't use OLS. I calculated the ratio between the securities at the present time, comparing it to the historical ratio using Bollinger Bands (a form of technical analysis). Bollinger Bands draw the mean of your time series, and a standard deviation or two above and below it, depending on the sensitivity you set. I created Bollinger Bands around the time series of SecurityA/SecurityB, and when that ratio crossed the lower or upper bands, I'd make a trade. Essentially, when the ratio of the securities deviated too far from a historical mean. 

That Quantopian post seems to do something very similar using z-scores.

As some shameless promotion, here's the post I made about it: https://keithselover.wordpress.com/2016/11/10/algorithmic-trading-part-2-pairs-trading-and-statistical-arbitrage/

I can't really speak to the efficacy of this method versus OLS. I never compared them. The results using Bollinger Bands were satisfactorily market neutral, but not necessarily optimal.

EDIT: By getting into your long and short positions at whatever the current ratio between the securities is, you guarantee that your long-side and short-sides are dollar-matched. I think that addresses something you brought up in your post. "

2017-03-06 21:52:01,"This doesn't require machine learning to accomplish. You're describing a typical optimization problem which can be solved in a number of ways (even in relatively simple ways, like an Excel sheet). 

The problem is that the results you're expecting aren't feasible. Simply combining a bunch of technical indicators in a specific combination doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to yield an arbitrarily accurate model (at least while considering over fitting).

As far as defining predictive power, that's entirely up to the designer. Different strategies have different goals, so models can differ greatly as a result.

And for position sizing, that's typically dependent on the probability of profit and return of your model. If your model is designed to make many small, risky trades, your portfolio needs to reflect this (and vice-versa).

Over-fitting can occur in any project to any degree. It's too broad an outline and too broad a concept to give any reasonable answers to. But machine learning in finance is plagued with issues with over-fitting. There's just a lot of noise in this kind of data. "

2018-07-03 18:13:38,"Hey thanks for your message. I used backtrader for months and was happy with it for the most part except:

1. Data feeds behave differently in back tests vs live. I saw some posts about this but I could never sort it out and what I read was not easily applied. A principle of least surprise here would be a good strategy imo.

2. It should be easy to store data offline for future back tests. Maybe a cache of some kind. This was a pain to accomplish and I ended up using observers or writers or something with the caveat that I needed a whole different data feed to reuse this data. If I just had one data feed I could live but with the number I needed it was a pain.

3. No vectorized back tests. Again I had to end up using something else. It would be killer if there was a way to vectorize those that can be vectorized.

I guess the summary is: backtrader is great, but it misses a few things needed to be useful on a day to day basis for me. If I'm going to write the code to fill those gaps then I might as well write my own thing."
2018-07-03 17:58:28,"`bt` and `backtrader` (usually imported as `bt`) have different approaches. `bt` focuses on composing *Algos* and offers pre-canned statistics. The backtesting, as far as I looked into it, is concerned with the composition and not with the simulation of trading where it comes down to making decisions.

It is my belief that this is probably appreciated by people who are not looking at the highest possible accuracy but to test ideas (which will later be implemented in a different engine for trading purposes)

`backtrader` is concerned with offering the exact same code for backtesting and trading (though the former can be sped up by running in pseudo-vectorized mode) and also in facilitating a quick prototyping and development of indicators, data feeds, analyzers and other concepts. Statistics are not precanned and the choice of what to count is left to the end user (several Analyzers are provided and ready to be plugged in)

Both offer different approaches and even being the author of `backtrader` I do understand that some people may like what `bt` offers to them.

&gt; Too much magic

You don't have to like `backtrader` (it cannot be everybody's cup of tea), but I would very much appreciate where you see the *magic* and why this *magic* is (or may be) bad.

Being autocorrelated is a different concern. If they are, you might want to look at bootstrapping. See block bootstrap from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)

It's not the market but what we call the process. So when the Monte Carlo simulation runs it will take random input and apply that to ""the process.""

Towards the end of the article you'll see Brownian motion is mentioned with log returns. This is a linear process. To be precise, log linear, but that's details.

An example of a non-linear process is say a European option, which will pay off relative to some strikt value.

If we were trying to price an option on crypto we could use Monte Carlo to apply randomly selected crypto returns on the option value formula, example: max((S - K), 0)
 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp

Since this contains a max function we can easy see that it's non-linear, at which point Monte Carlo simulations start making sense.

Point is: if the process is linear, Monte Carlo is a waste of CPU..

Hope it helps?

Python has all the data zeitgeist, meaning more libraries with stronger support for analysis &amp; machine learning. Things like backtesting libraries, Pandas for time-series analysis and datetime alignment (essential in finance - can't live without \`pd.resample()\`).

Then you run 100k or whatever of these, producing 100k average returns. If you average these 100k average returns against eachother, that value will be the same (+ simulation noise) as the average of your initial 100 values.

And then using those returns to basically produce a set of Brownian motions.. the average of these if you run enough simulations is the average of r over the period we draw from.

This would be different if instead of a linear process the returns where feed into a non-linear process like an option.. this is because the option payoff is not linear on the underlying.

There's little value in using Monte Carlo simulations on simple linear processes because of this."

You also get more frequent failure conditions by the exchanges. So you can run your code through the gambit in crypto letting your platform trade real time for very little cash at risk.

Going long calls/puts with that small amount of money would put you hugely out of the money each time and have a near zero chance of repeated profits for most underlyings.

However if gambling is needed, you could try out of the money levered vix options uvxy or tvix, but vid ask spreads can reach 10 to 15 percent.  Also an 8 dollar commission will kill you.

If someone in your company read the comments scattered all over the Internet about

  - Having to run either TWS or the Gateway
  - The quality and functionality of the current API implemented in the aforementioned Gateway and TWS

Your company would then quickly consider removing the blinkers and start implementing something new. Because you won't find a single comment praising neither the tools nor the API. Yes, one can work with them and if people do it's not because of what people in your company believe: it is because you offer competitive prices and access to a comprehensive set of markets. People do even cope with the handicapped data streaming service you offer (let's put your accounting nightmare and reporting aside)

Customers want:

  - A lean and modern API (REST is enough) to use your company as a broker for algotrading
  - Without having to run a proprietary client in the operating system

If you want to provide a complex framework for additional things:

  - Keep the Java Monster

But

  - Don't force it down the throat of those who just want to get streaming prices and being able to send orders to you.

Run a poll, send a mail to your customers asking, do something ... but TALK to your customers and LISTEN to them.

Many companies have already learnt that no matter how good the product manager in the company thinks he/she is ... the customers are a far more powerful tool to develop the product (especially with large customer bases, which is your case)

You haven't yet launched the product: please avoid the huge mistake of doing it implemented in the Gateway."

Appreciate the response; I've been trying to understand Takion API for the past week (My C++ experience prior to last 2 weeks did not extend beyond using and updating vectors for a physics class, so the magnitude of C++ concepts unknown to me upon this endeavor was somewhat overwhelming - OOP, APIs etc.). By asking this question, I was hoping to find any parallels between the responses and Takion API itself (I apologize for not specifying).


So far, i know that there's a class called TakionDialog in one of the API headers which inherits from CDialog (a windows application related class?):

class UGUI_API TakionDialog : public CDialog

But i am really slow in making further progress (what particular methods are necessary, where to call em, further nuances). As always, any further direction in this regards is much appreciated

That being said, none of the metrics you mention are knowable from IB as far as I can tell. They throttle you and bounce their servers if and how they please.

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  - Why do I need the gateway to use a REST API?

Ah ... because it is still the same old dog (ok, now older) but with a new trick.

So, instead of ditching what the customers DON'T WANT to use the API (a Java monster running in the system), you implement the REST API in the gateway (and probably in TWS) instead of offering a public server.

  - Has anyone at Interactive Brokers really thought this through?

  - Have you considered hiring a 20 year old guy to bring some fresh blood into the company and let you know that you can run servers with throttling in Containers/Virtual Machines/Hardware in a matter of minutes?

  - Have you even talked to your customers?

IB's API is complicated and for most requires a 3rd party gate ... I use ibinsync/Python. Once you get it working it is extremely powerful. It is a great data source and ideal for trading options, which is what I use it for.

You can have Python programs running as Linux daemons to pull down as much data as your ever need to use.

You run your programs either through TWS or IB Gateway (recommended).

The API documentation is incomplete and difficult to use (in some areas). I figured out how much of it work by combing through the ibinsync code line by line. It took half a summer to get it to completely work.

If the RESTful Beta ever pans out, it is going to save a lot of traders a lot of time. It will have to be very full-featured though because the current API, as hard as it is to figure out, is at least that. "

2019-01-10 11:18:31,"I am biased but you should absolutely use LEAN  (https://www.github.com/QuantConnect/LEAN) as its the only substantial battle-tested, multi-exchange crypto algorithm platform in the world. Others who claim ""equities is close enough"" really haven't done it. 

It might look similar from the outside, there are many substantial differences between crypto security type and other assets that you only find out once you get deep into it. LEAN originally supported crypto trying to model it as an FX pair, but quickly had to do the hard work of pull it out into its own security type and models. Even now we are still working on core modeling differences to make it flawless.

\#1: Fundamentally most brokerages do not model crypto as a pair (e.g. EURUSD, AAPL-USD) but as stores of physical coins. More often than not a traditional FX sale of ""EURUSD"" relies on borrowing the EUR for sale. This lending is automatically handled by most brokerages but in crypto, the trade would bounce as you don't have sufficient currency on hand. My hope is that in time crypto-exchanges become more like traditional brokerages and maintain the currency pair history in your account - but its likely a long way off. 

\#2: The NxN combinations of fees, base &amp; cross coin-trades, methods of margin (or not providing margin) make it a difficult software challenge not handled by most backtesting platforms. LEAN handles these for you - but it took 80 contributors almost 2 years work to get there. In LEAN we pull apart the ""coins"", store them in a separated cash book, convert and them to the portfolio accounting currency for calculating your equity. Fees are then applied in the currency of the transaction. In crypto fees are sometimes in USD, sometimes in the quote currency, sometimes tether etc. Even applying fees require a currency conversion data feed to model properly.

\#3: Massive number of crypto venues; with different APIs, slippage, ... etc. More than any other asset class arbitrage and multi/cross-exchange connectivity is important. LEAN has 6 open sourced brokerage implementations so far and more are getting added every day. We have people all over the world writing thousands of lines of code to connect and manage state to crypto exchanges.  Crypto wise we have GDAX, Binance and Bitfinex.

There are many other differences but too much to count here. Save yourself some headache use LEAN :)"

All really good intraday traders that I know synthesize information from different sources to assess the possibilities, then develop a plan of action for each scenario. They will also constantly update their mental model if the data change. The best traders also know when to make ad hoc decisions to break their own rules. In other words, there are a lot of variables and a lot of complexity here, and a lot of it is somewhat ""fuzzy"". I think this is difficult to model accurately. 

The better approach might be to attempt to identify the core concepts used by the trader and attempt to adapt those for use in an algorithm. In any case I think you first need to understand what the trader is doing and why and how.

2019-01-10 06:01:14,"**Hyperparameter optimization**

In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.

The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.

2019-01-10 04:20:19,"You need to think about the modelling, you metioned:

- one trader
- his activity
- market conditions 

You are saying the trader is beating the market, so I guess you want to ""learn"" this treaders moves and to project them on an unseen data? 

Im not sure that as a solution this is a good one but practice has always value..
First because this is only one trader, and no one trader provides ""big data"" in terms of machine learning solutions. Classic models (regressions, trees etc) will perform poorly because most likely the model wont encompess enough situation it will be too broad.
Try to think about batches of data that you iterate on loops on (tensorflow aproach), but most likely you just dont hsve enough data for this.

Now think about the data structure, can you treat all market conditions as numerical features such market pct growth and sharex traded etc or do you have categorial data that is not quantitative by nature and reflects a state such as ""media speaks about market rise"" (in this case this will be a feature that recieves [0,1].
Building a strong dataset is a mess, most likely, hiw many features you want? 10?100? 10000? You need to catch many diefferent scenarios (this is what ml is all about). Do you have enough data to create them?

In neural networks you have reinforcement learning, this type of algorithms is used to solve games in perfect scenario.. so given a set of constant rules (pre defined game)  if built correctly the model finds the most effective solution trying many strategies..

This strategy is more effective than yours because you simply try to learn a how would a one specific person react. Both solutions are not effective because the rules of the game change constantly in the real market (as oppose to training data).

In any case I think it any way you choose aill teach you a lot and the shortcoming of this model will teach you how to build better models in future.

Just remember that beating the market is hard and creating AI that does this is even harder.

A decompiler is a computer program that takes an executable file as input, and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is therefore the opposite of a compiler, which takes a source file and makes an executable. Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce obfuscated code. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in the reverse engineering of computer software.

I've been modding my current MM script (which involves RSI, Bollinger signals and a 'neversellataloss' value that degrades over time to ensure it never holds anything too too long) for different exchanges. By and large I'm finding that exchanges with higher volumes create more trades, and that generates more volume which is good for the current MM script which is designed to take advantage of large bid/asks spreads.

One strategy I've been looking to exploit more is finding smaller volume exchanges that offer competitive entry-level fees - where I don't have the volumes to get the lesser fees on larger exchanges, some outfits like [Darb Finance offer 0.05% maker fees](https://darbfinance.com/?=Crored) which is about half the industry introductory rate average. While the volumes might be considerably less, it effectively can net net far more yield with far less trades - which lessens exposure and risk."

Because it affects how the agent learns - I would suggest you to read the following neat article:

[https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752)"

2019-04-14 15:10:30,"Lemme lay down the basics,

When your agent tells you what action to take you return to it a reward.

This reward indicates to the optimizer how to change the weights of the policy network.

If the reward was good then the optimizer will strengthen/reinforce (hence the name reinforcement learning) the signal for this action **WHEN** this state (the state that has lead to taking the given action) occurs.

If the reward was bad then the optimizer will decrease the likelihood for the given action to be re-chosen when it sees this state.

The changes the optimizer does should happen by small bits at a time, leading to proper adjustment of the policy to find the right action for each states. that is why small learning rate and techniques like clipping (prevents large changes) are used in the PPO algorithm.

So your indication for the agent when to exit are via rewarding but note the following:

Your job is to:

A. Provide a proper feedback to the actions the agent takes via reward. if it was a bad action, penalize it so it won't repeat it next time. If it is good, reward it so It'll remember that this state was a good state to take this action.

B. Provide a good observations/state of the market to the agent. If it cant differentiate bad state to short from good state to short by ONLY looking at the state - how do you expect it to remember when is it good or bad to perform those actions.

The state can be: the price of the stock, the state of the machine (is longing, shorting or not holding stock at all) or what ever information **you** decide the agent needs in order to distinguish current state of the market from other states.

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest you to start with longing only - if it will work out, try to add shorting."

2019-04-14 14:33:10,"this is a good point.  The reason I asked if you shorted is because the backtesting I'm doing doesn't involve shorting, and I found it tough to get the agent to trade when it knows that the only time it is rewarded is either when it is long, or when it sells, which lead to it always buying back at the next bar, regardless of price.  I've had *some* success with providing a reward based on the price being lower at re-entry than it was when the previous position was closed.  

I should also mention that my biggest focus is on sideways markets, as I'm trying to find a way to get the agent to calm the F down when in a scenario where there are no rewards to be earned regardless of position.  I tried giving a small reward if it chose to do nothing when the price movement in between bars was less than the fee it would have incurred in a trade, but all that did was make it wait until the price moved just above the fee cost before entering (or exiting) a losing trade."

2019-04-14 14:20:14,"Simply check the profit if you would liquidate now compared to previous steps.

If the liquidation profit has increased from the previous step - It is a good hold.

If the liquidation profit has decreased compared to previous step - it is a bad hold.

You can also implement thresholds, preferably percentages or even look back two or more steps. depending on your time frame.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you'll make the reward really small - It has to be something to encourage the reinforcement to happen."

2019-04-14 14:07:47,"Two things I can think of:

You're using a time period that has a strong directional bias. Too many winning short trades reinforces your ""go long"" since it gets a reward when closing the trade. 

I had the same issue where I would try to learn one specific trading period where there was a strong uptrend. I wanted the RL to buy at the beginning and sell at the end.

Because it only got positive rewards for selling (closing the trade), the weights for that action grew large enough that it would sell rather than buy the whole way through.

I think it would be wise to split up the action of buying, selling and closing. If you think of each action as a seperate linear model, you're reinforcing the whole ""short - close"" model for a profitable LONG trade. Since that's the action that led to a reward. 

It could be you're not dealing with the same issue but that was something I was dealing with."

2019-04-14 13:39:44,"Any reward you give at any point implies to the agent if he has chosen the right action which causes reinforcement throught the optimization.

If you reward it when it enters short regardless to what happens next. It will reinforce the current state through the optimization, increasing the likelihood for it will choose the same action again when ever the state is similar to now.
What if that action was bad? You still reinforced it as good.

You are training on backtests, exploit the fact that you already know what happens next and reward the agent accordingly.

Regarding the fact that it doesn't exit well.
I would suggest implementing small rewards on holding in the following format:

Say you entered long and on next step, price goes - reward the agent with small amount.
Lets assume all next 5 steps, the trend is still going upwards - keep rewarding the agent for hold.
Now that the price has finally reversed, the agent is supposed to exit but chooses to hold, so a negative or lesser reward should be given to imply to the agent he should have exited and not hold.
This can be done with a certain threshold but you get the general idea.

Hope this helps :)"

2019-07-20 03:23:06,"Yesm but it is not as easy as order routing because....

&amp;#x200B;

...traditionally you do order routing to exchanges from ONE broker with ONE account. I.e. it does not matter where the order is executed, cash and stocks live in one account.

In crypto, every exchange is separate, so traditional roder routing only can be done if 

* you have the relevant assets in the relevant broker. I.,e. enough to handle the order.
* your risk profile matches (broker a may have a lot of money, broler b not so).
* your margin profile with the broker is ok

If you buy bitcoin in broker a and sell them on broker b, you are not flat, you are long and short in 2 accounts and most move the bitcoin first. Or have bitcoin in account b that you sold, and then where do you move them?  This is VERY different from what smart order routing is normally. There is a LOT more to it from an operational point of view than just touring the order."

2019-07-19 10:18:55,"Pattern recognition is done by using the [Euler Characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic) that you will find after you have converted your dataset into some geometrical figure expressed under the form of a matrix that you would use to make images.

The hard part is to transform the raw data into a matrix of values that will correspond to the geometric figure of the raw data. Since the raw data is very noisy, you have to find a way to eliminate the noise at the very first steps, because you need to have a continuously smooth line instead of a hashed random walk to express the evolution of the price in time.

The shape must reveals by itself, you are not supposed to set and test if the vertices, edges and faces are fitting by yourself, they will just appear or not, because the shape is always changing over time.

You can then deduct the Euler characteristic by some simple computation to determine and count the vertices, edges and faces of the shape described by your matrix.

Once you have determined what kind of shape (by homeomorphism) and the position of the supply and demand (the order book) inside that figure, you can make your decisions.

Anything else would be a miracle.

&gt; Any ideas to maximize profits before I start trading 2 contracts at a time?

This question, imho, is wrong. Your strategy has to work on a `x` profit-points per contract basis. Trading **2** (or more) contracts has nothing to do with having mastered the maximization of profits. It has to do with position sizing. There are several approaches to decide what your approach to position sizing has to be.

My recommendation is that you read this book (or any other similar if you prefer):

2019-07-19 06:27:08,I’m not taking about scalping. Overnight the price can change drastically. Once the market opens it can rebound or continue on its path. It might take a min or it might take 10 minutes to find its path. I see it happening but don’t pull the trigger out of fear that it will swing again. Is there any way to determine if the momentum is strong enough to keep it going one way for 20 minutes or so?
2019-07-19 06:22:00,The way to identify movements earlier is colocate your server in the exchange so it doesn't take hundreds of milliseconds to get the latest prices

2019-10-22 17:29:06,"&gt; Not sure what you mean by ""Comm structure"".

Commission structure. Current structure is -2.5/7.5. I assume that you are flat on funding, not taking that into account.

What is the percentage of times you are a ""maker"" vs taker? If we assume that you are 100% maker, then you must be earning 2*2.5bps per trade just on commissions. 

Now I see a problem immediately: You are making 5bps on commissions, but your pnl is 1 to 5bps, meaning that basically you are not earning the bid/ask spread at all and you are actually losing on your MM strategy 0 to 4 bps. 

&gt; Assumed filled ratio: 1 

I was kind of expecting this. Please spend some time logging the fill rate. It is not 1. It is very far from 1, especially on bitmex.

Make 2 'idiot' algos:

1. First algo is constantly trading ""at market"". With size of 1, you won't spend much on commissions. This is your best case benchmark on fill ratio and slippage due to latency.

2. Second algo is always quoting at best bid, then once filled, tries to sell at best offer, and back at trying to get filled at best bid

Second algo has 0 alpha, but you can see how aweful your fill rate will be and how high the toxic fill ratio will be. 

- Now you can compare the results to your algo and see how much have you improved from option 2. If close to none, then your algo has as much alpha as an option 2 algo and you're using wrong backtesting assumptions.
- Use the actual numbers in your backtest. Do not assume anything.
- BTW, are you using any open source packages for backtesting or your own?
- Check that option2 algo on backtest has similar performance as live, until it does, your backtesting assumptions are wrong. Doing MM research under wrong assumptions is a waste of time"

Everything matters when trying to squeeze out a profit, including fees. I am pretty sure everyone understands that. I am suggesting that we shouldn't be delusional ... you must pay for some services if you intend to use them.  I have former students who have shown me the fees that their companies pay for the microwave services. The fees are enormous. And yet they don't think twice about paying them .... they are out of business if they don't pay them.

Me too. We are out of business if we don't pay the fees we must pay to employ our strategies. And for us most of the time the fees actually don't matter all that much. As a percent of our trade, they are too small to matter. I'll make a $120,000 futures trade for $5.00."

Just if you have something which works does not mean it cannot be improved substantially. Also, if you have something which works, you can obviously demand to get first some ideas to see if it's worth the trade of information.

Of curse, you can doubt that I will ever manage to get profitable. Three months ago, I would have admitted that there is a high chance that I will fail. Since then, I have:

* Found a first strategy which was profitable in backtests
* Run it live and realized that there were some wrong assumptions
* Developed a second strategy for which the performance is now similar to the backtests and for which the backtest results have been great until recently

By now, I have not much doubt left that I will get it working. If possible, I would just like to avoid another 10 iterations until I am at that point."

The paid version gives you access to TWS, IB API and better trade execution. All of IB's paid features are worth more to me than the measly few hundred dollars I pay them.

It's the same reason I spend a few hundred dollars per month on data subscriptions. ""Free"" is too expensive for me.

Fees obviously eat into profits so you want to reduce them as much as possible, but until ""free"" includes the same level of quality I'll continue to pay."
2019-10-22 13:44:00,"No official docs exist. You can find implementations on Github, but I reverse-engineered their APIs by inspecting outgoing network requests from Robinhood's web app."
2019-10-22 13:39:20,"This. Nothing is ever 100% secure, but the idea that  people would be able to complete reverse engineer the entire basis of a strategy from its signals is like trying to derive a private key from the public key (encryption).

It's virtually impossible relative that other attack vectors that target the person would be more cost effective than reverse engineering via signals.

That said, isolated strategies that only use one data source would be a lot easier to replicate, but it would take such a long time still to confirm a successful replication with confidence that you might as well spend that time coming up with your own strategy, or just follow the signals."

2019-10-22 12:12:57,"Ok. But to be fair. For someone looking to invest for retirement over the course of 40 years, it's not a bad play. I think the advice was more for people who aren't looking to sink a lot of time into managing their own investments. And most firms that manage your investments charge more than the benefit you get from their management. A lot of hedge funds underperform index funds by quite a bit.  So unless someone is qualified to make informed decisions on who to invest with or do algo trading it's good advice to just put your money into an index fund. 

For example I'm a working engineer. And started following this sub cause I thought I wanted to get into this more while also getting better with algorithms and programming at the same time. But I haven't at all.  

My point being it was decent advice for your average working person trying to save for retirement who doesn't have a lot of extra time to put into investing. Sure he didn't go that route but his full time career was in finance."

2019-10-22 09:49:43,I think my comment made it pretty obvious that you can't. In most cases exchanges charge mandatory fees for access. Brokers don't have the option of offering it to anyone for free. Pay the fee or do without.

In other words: The one that actually *takes* fees."
2019-10-22 09:45:51,But where can I get full exchange limit order books for free?
2019-10-22 09:43:29,"Not to be overly cranky, but perhaps your question should instead ask, ""Which free brokerage is best for an aspiring algo trader just starting to learn?""

The reason that I say that is because once you, either individually or part of a team, actually start to use machine-assisted trading following a set of algorithms, you are quite happy to pay whatever fees are necessary or useful to supplement your trading.

For example, if your programs need to see the full set of complete, low-latency limit order books for all operating exchanges, you are going to pay for that. If you need good historical data you are going to pay for that. I personally pay fees of somewhere around $200 per month, and sometimes pay one-time fees in the thousands of dollars (such as for CBOE data) and I shop aggressively for what I buy.

This movement to zero fees is actually the death-knell of retail online brokerage. This will be followed by a brutal consolidation of brokerages (which is clearly already underway) and a substantial reduction of services. I actually expect primary fees to rise in the long term as the competition is whittled down to an oligopoly.

If you are trying to learn via API perhaps you should start with Alpaca, because their API is RESTful and they actually support it. But you can experiment with various strategies there as you learn.

I am not recommending Alpaca because I use it. I would never use a free site because I am not willing to accept the limitations, such as paid (to the broker) order routing that goes with the contract. As I said at the opening, you are not likely to survive in this brutal business unless you pay for the services you need."

2019-10-22 07:36:25,"&gt; ZeroMQ seems to be one of the few options available, but there isn't a ton of documentation available, there's an Oreilly book but with code based on C. 

The http://zguide.zeromq.org/ is the book plus some more material and most of the examples have contributions for languages beyond C.  It's 80% of what one needs.  The other 80% is looking at code in projects using zeromq.  To use it from Python add https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/ and 
https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/

One thing that may not be obvious from the zguide is that (imo) if one works in C or C++ the focus should be in learning CZMQ.  https://github.com/zeromq/czmq/  http://czmq.zeromq.org/

libzmq is a high performance kernel but for the next level up in code structure complexity CZMQ provides many important primitives.  I'm not a fan of the containers it provides (zlist, etc) but since CZMQ can be used from C++ this poses no real problem.  It's the zactor, zpoller, zloop where CZMQ really brings it.

PyZMQ provides some of these same concepts."

2020-01-25 15:50:37,"Personally I've never seen the value of Monte Carlo analysis. In my view, it doesn't tell you anything more than a measure like Sharpe ratio will.

A problem with Sharpe ratio is the choice of lookahead parameter (i.e how far ahead is the comparison sample for mean / variance calculation). I've had some positive results using a blend of Sharpe ratios with different lookaheads - which can more thoroughly penalise trade sequences which might be due to ""luck""."

I like coding in C++ better then Rust. I've worked with both, and the C++ ecosystem is like 1000x larger. It has better IDE support, pretty much every library is written in C++ or C at its core. Rust has a lot of weirdness to it that makes it hard to get used to if you are coming from a background of C/C#/C++/Java. It has more memory safety then C++ but honestly C++ is pretty safe when you use the STL"
2020-04-30 09:22:09,"Those are pretty good distinctions, all these terms are pretty fuzzy, but of the top of my head I would define:
ML: Machine Learning, some model which changes after experiencing something new (most often new/more data, but self play is becoming increasingly important)  
DL: Deep Learning deals with neural networks with many layers (the name comes from having a 'deep' neural network), but often the DNN is just a part of a larger system. Some would say that you're not really doing deep learning until the model is over-parameterized (more parameters than training data)
AI: Artificial Intelligence-really meaningless in most contexts. Any computer system which does the work that people used to do could be rightfully called artificial intelligence. What counts as AI and what doesn't largely depends on what we 'expect' from computers. If we make a system to do something new it will be called AI for a few years, but as the field advances things that were once called AI. Any machine learning technique can reasonably be called AI, but not all AI techniques are ML techniques. 
AGI: Artificial General Intelligence: Systems which are meant to mimic *all* the learning abilities of humans. This is more in line with what people think of as sci-fi computer intelligence."

What is the difference? 

My understanding is:

* ML is the most general definition that encompasses any predictive model that gets better with more data (OLS regression, clustering etc...)

* Deep learning is reserved for more complex systems such as neural networks

* AI is more specific in some way (more 'intelligent' systems?)"

There are better choices available today than Java so I see no reason to use it. C# is superior and has just as much, if not more, libraries available for trading. People always have their preferences though and many people still like java.

C++ has some libraries available but I assume if you're going that route then you're not doing it for the libraries (you'd use python in that case). You're probably doing it for the speed, in which case Rust will get you the same results but easier. And over time Rust will get more libraries. Rust has the benefit of having a package manager so libraries are more shareable."

A jet that flies to multiple places where you are certain with who they met with can help you deduce who owns it. For example a jet that flies from Omaha to Wichita KS may be Koch industries. From there keep watching the jet to see if they do anything else that would corroborate that theory. The real problem is with jet leasing companies because they use the same jet for multiple clients.

2020-04-30 02:09:05,"I use R because I use it in my job and I’m more fluent in it. This allows me to experiment faster and test more hypoteses in a shorter timeframe.

Because I use a lot of statistics and ML and speed is not an issue when prototyping, I prefer it to Python as R is a statistician’s tool, as others have mentioned.

Use what you’re most comfortable with and what suits your purpose (I wouldn’t use either for HFT for ex).

Your edge should not come from your tool unless you’re doing HFT which I would not suggest as a retail investor, you can’t compete with HFT shops anyway."
2020-04-30 02:06:24,"The best models are built on purer ground. Price information is not 2 dimensional; to get a model with no info loss (from lowering the dimension), you are going to be working on a manifold with many, many dimensions. 

One of the models im designing describes the price by plotting the order book up to the 10th level. Then it tries to find a parametrization of it by time. Just an example.

You’ll get a lot of interesting applications from geometry by analyzing tangent bundles on these models. I read about a fund that worked with defining topologies on price data, and they did very well (my topology knowledge is not advanced).

Any part of math can have an application to finance and trading when you start making models that do not platonify the inherent structure. Too many algos are built on predicting price based on 2-d models, whereas the big quants dont even predict, they just react based on models mirroring the random process.

A field that could emerge is stochastic manifolds, and I suspect that leading firms will be further “purifying” their models as markets become more crowded."
2020-04-30 02:02:38,"I think it is important that you are interested in this crypto stuff, in automating things and be ready to learn something new.

Learn to read charts, learn basic indicators, get some historical data and try basic stratgies and just play around. As a developer you have abilities to automate workflows where other people do it manually in excel.

I think on average I spend 2-4 hours per day for developing my stuff. I also think it depends on your personal situation, when you have a family and kids or other time consuming obligations, it will be hard to fully get into this besides a full time job. I sometimes think to to reduce hours (and switch to a part time job) to concentrate on this crypto thing. I am quite an introverted person, I don't need to party the whole weekend, sometimes I love to code instead :)"
2020-04-30 01:41:40,The only point I would make is that this approach is currently being widely exploited by institutional investors (and has been for some time). I recall attending several presentations/seminars a number of years ago talking about using this technique to predict China's economic output. I've also had several financial analytics providers attempt to sell Fund's that I've worked for data/capabilities like this.

2020-04-30 00:12:36,"I would say that ""alternative data"" is mostly garbage, especially if it's publicly available.

For instance, there are hedge funds that use satellite imaging of parking lots as a type of alt data.  The purpose of this data can be to predict sales, which then will have an effect on the stock price.  Think about the noise to info ratio on that chain, it's extremely high.

My belief is that a lot of these middle/low frequency alt data firms are mostly just grifters.  Either they exist to sell you this data, or the hedge funds that claim to use alt data primarily use it as a way to market themselves to get investor capital.  If they make money, well they just happen to be long during one of the biggest bull runs in history.  No serious proprietary desk is using this data that I know of.  

And as far as google searches for example, as someone working at a prominent trading firm, I can say there have been a handful of these types, experienced data scientists that claim to be able to implement sophisticated data scraping algorithms and literally none of them have made it more than a few months.

The reality is that a sharp rise in google searches or mentions on twitter is often a second order effect of news that's already out.  It's likely that almost all of that stuff is lagging data and useless for trading."

3. How about indicators or aggregation implemented in a non-standard way?

Examples

1. MetaTrader - significantly improved interaction with C++, C# and Python libraries in the last years, but still, literally, only 1.5 stock market broker actually uses it and I don't mean CFDs, I mean real stocks ... and of course, not open source, so one day you wake up and everything is gone ... check the history of OpenQuant framework
2. QuantConnect - the part with data processing is proprietary, it doesn't have simplest feature, like OCO orders and incompatible with intraday trading, and when I went through their code, I'd say it's a bit ugly and I don't want to rewrite it from scratch, also it's not a tick backtester, it visualises data after the trade, not in real time. Also, with latest changes, there is no way to debug it on local computer ... part of these complaints is related to StockSharp, specifically in part of ugly code and licensing
3. Python - haven't seen anything with real-time visualization
4. Java or C++ - who knows, maybe there is something meaningful, but this is where I know the least

2020-08-03 17:49:32,"Are you looking to include the height (H-L) of the two candles in your similarity metric? You might decide that you are only interested in ""types"" of candle (morning star, hammer etc).  If not, you could express the open and close in terms of their position between the H&amp;L i.e 0.0 = low, 1.0 = high, 0.5 half way. using this you could express the candle with two parameters, and compare them according to that using the sum of differences.

If you do care about the height, you need to decide how important an extra 10 pips in H-L height is, compared to the position of the open and close. Then you could weight the height difference, and open close difference.

So:

float candle\_dist(c1,c2,ocw,hw)

{

h1= c1.h-c1.l;

o1=(c1.o-c1.l) / h1

c1=(c1.c-c1.l) / h1;

h2=c2.h-c2.l;

o2=(c2.o-c2.l) / h2;

c2=(c2.c-c2.l) /h2;

ocdist=abs(o1-o2)+abs(c1-c2);

hdist=abs(h2-h1);

return ocw\*ocdist+hw\*hdist;

}

c1 &amp; c2 are the two candles, ocw is the weighting you apply to open close difference, and hw is the weighting for height difference.

If you answer yes.  Bless your heart.

A part of creating a successful algo is being able to identify relevant variables (You can apply this principle in real life too!).

Stochastic processes (including GBM) are used in derivative pricing because they are good at creating a probability density function of what prices in the future may look like. And with derivatives they are price as the discounted expected payoff of the PDF of estimated future prices. 

Now with trading in very general terms you want to know whether something is going up or down which stochastic processes will not be able to produce by themselves. 

The only use case I can think of is if an asset is trading at $100 you can use gbm to estimate a range (to a certain degree of confidence) that the price will likely fall within over the next n periods. So it’s trading at $100 you can say it’s likely it will remain between $95-$105 over the next n periods, if all parameters hold true. 

There’s a lot of real world nuance, like what standard deviation you use, what value you use for a drift term, which stochastic process you use, should a jump term be added etc..."
2020-08-03 16:21:54,"It is not a standard thing. Almost every library I look at does it wrong. Maybe wrong is the standard, but you don’t want it.

Backtesting nonstationary time series is extremely hard. If you simply replay historical data, you are likely just filtering for false positives. Cross-fold validation doesn’t work for features with look back windows. If you take random windows you may end up with a first moment bias (buy and hold). What you really want is a combination of hand picked validation sets which span different regimes plus some synthetic data to check for false biases. Then you need to rotate those sets and freshen them up whenever you try a new model or tune metaparameters. Finally, a paper-trading run against the latest market with the code you’d use in production.  And oh how do you simulate fills? Just because the price touches you order doesn’t mean it would fill completely. And what about the market impact of your order?  And so on...

You can use the ohlcv, technical indicators, trends, sediment data, a random number generator, or something you make up. I personally like to experiment with everything ;) if you know what I mean. You find something that works and you go with it. Backtesting is the biggest thing because you want to have a consistent algo that can do good in any market conditions.

For Chrome replacement I considered Selenium + HTMLUnit, although haven't had time to try it out properly yet.  


The code is relatively straightforward, so I'm not too concerned altogether, although the majority of it is the [gateway\_client.py](https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam/blob/master/ibeam/src/gateway_client.py) so this could use some review for sure just to check if I didn't forget something.

If you approximate the stock as a random walk that is slightly predictable with no transportation costs, then your profit will increase in a square root relationship with the square root of how frequent you trade (faster is better). However transaction costs, bid-ask spreads and adverse selection (if you try to avoid paying the spread) made it more like a choice between one $0.78 trade or 4 $0.18 trades."

Features:

* **Facilitates continuous headless run of the Gateway.**
* **No physical display required** \- virtual display buffer can be used instead.
* **No interaction from the user required** \- automated injection of IBKR credentials into the authentication page used by the Gateway.
* **TLS certificate support** \- you can provide your own certificates.
* **Containerised using Docker** \- it's a plug and play image, although IBeam can be used as standalone too.

2020-11-04 11:16:34,"Asset allocation often refers to a long-term portfolio mix, whereas quants often backtest high-frequency strategies. There is overlap, though. If your target allocation is 60/40 stocks/bonds (say SPY and IEF), you can backtest strategies that rebalance at various time intervals, from daily to annually, or that require various deviations from the target (for example rebalance only when the stock weight is above 65% or below 55%) to trigger a rebalance.

Since most traders are unprofitable while long-term investors have done well, arguably a retail quant's first job is to automate an asset allocation strategy."
2020-11-04 10:31:46,"I mean really there should be minimal difference, if any. I think a good backtesting system should be agnostic to what the decision logic of the strategy is. It just simulates the changes in state of a brokerage account over some historical period, given some historical data and an arbitrary strategy. Differences might arise in how results are interpreted and measured.

That being said, I am talking about a 'monilothic' system that can handle anything you throw at it."

1) AON (All or None): the order will not partial fill. It will sit unfilled until there is enough liquidity to fill your entire order.

2) IOC (Immediate or Cancel): the order will exist for a short amount of time. During this time, your order can be partial or completely filled. After the amount of time, any unfilled portion gets cancelled.

3) FOK (Fill or Kill): A combination of (1) and (2).

2020-11-04 01:18:45,"Essentially, demand zones in the context of trading are price areas that have historically been seen as good areas for investors to buy a stock or security (increase for demand for stock when the price is in these areas). When the price dips into these ranges, buyers tend to come in, which is why you’ll often see stocks bounce at these levels. Supply zones are the opposite, historically investors or traders have seen these price zones as areas where they are overvalued in the short term, so the sell positions or reduce risk. The supply of shares outweighs the demand for shares in these areas, so the price will often drop until it reaches an area where demand overcomes supply, which is often at precious demand zones"

I have a ""platform"" that displays the candlestick and volume chart, as well as any study/indicator graphs that I'd like to enable. I also have buttons/hotkeys for buying and selling, and the OHLC graph will display pending orders and open positions when the orders get filled. I tried to recreate the thinkorswim experience as close as possible, mostly because i had gotten accustomed to its UX.

My intention from the very beginning was to write and test algorithms for trading, but I realized very early on that a visualization tool would help me immensely in understanding all the numbers that I'd inevitably be staring at, so I put the algorithm research on hold to first develop such a tool. I'm at the point now where the platform has nearly all the features I need to validate ideas quickly, but I think anyone who's done this for a long time will tell you that generating promising ideas is the most difficult part of algotrading.

To answer your question, I'm sure there are many ways it could be done with many different scripting/programming languages. I personally did all my development in C++ using Qt, with a few python scripts for the APIs. I don't have any real reason for picking C++/Qt other than I really like programming in C++. If you're looking for rapid development, I wouldn't really recommend C++, unless you're a top tier C++ programmer. But if you're at such a proficiency, maybe you could find an alternative to C++ and build something much more quickly that way. I'm not nearly at that stage."

2021-02-09 13:13:54,"pairs trading is a strategy that in involves longing one stock and shorting another stock. what you're effectively doing is treading the spread in between two stocks.

so you choose 2 stocks that are in similar sectors, have similar economic fundamentals and similar risk exposures. based on this information, we should in theory expect these 2 stocks to have similar price behavior. 

an example of this is mastercard (MA) and visa (V). since they're identical companies that have similar sectors, economic fundamentals, and risk exposures, we should expect them to have similar price behavior. 

but sometimes they go ""out of sync"" with each other. sometimes mastercard will go up too much and visa will go down too much. this opens up an opportunity for a pairs trade. we short mastercard (since it's overvalued) and long visa stock (since it's undervalued). then we wait for the spread in between these 2 stocks to close as the 2 stocks come back to meet each other again."

If i could find a way to trade 1000x time a day with 1000$ orders, that'd be feasible for small time individuals.

I'm thinking you're 100% right.  I just really prefer the idea of a constant stream of transactions rather than slower, bigger bets, but it seems like Market Making is the only avenue for that.  If nothing else, it makes things more interesting and feel more productive rather than having my desktop running for hours deciding not to buy in.

    #divThreshold is relative to Exponential Moving Avg for 99 minutes
    
    
    ##Bullish Market Params
    upTrendTime=3
    divThreshold=.998
    bailThreshold=.97
    
    ##Adjusts Bail/Div Thresholds and the upTrendTime. If ema6hr or ema2day ##is downwards, greater divThreshold and lower bailThreshold
    if(((ema2day[k]-ema2day[k-1])&lt;0) | ((ema6hr[k]-ema6hr[k-1])&lt;0) | askBNBPrice&lt;ema6hr[k])| (askBNBPrice&lt;ema2day[k])):
        divThreshold=.992
        upTrendTime=1
        bailThreshold=.99
    
    ##Buy Condition
    if((askBNBPrice&lt;(divThreshold*ema99[k])) &amp; ((ema7[k]-ema7[k-upTrendTime])&gt;0) &amp; (trendingUp==1) &amp; (freeUSD&gt;220) &amp; (boughtIn==0)):
        print('Buy')
    ##Sell Condition
    if((ema7[k-1] &gt; ema7[k-0]) &amp; (ema7[k-1] &gt; ema7[k]) &amp; (bidBNBPrice&gt;(lastBuyPrice*1.0025)) &amp; (freeBNB&gt;0.1) &amp; (boughtIn==1)):

    ##Bail Condition
    if((ema7[k-5] &gt; ema7[k]) &amp; (ema7[k]&lt;(lastBuyPrice*bailThreshold)) &amp; (freeBNB&gt;0.1)):
        print('BAIL!!')

Code above is what I used for trading for last 24 hours for BNB, LTC, ALGO, ETH, and ATOM on Binance.  The parameters get tweaked depending on the Crypto backtesting results, and I'm working on adding more market conditions (e.g. ema6hr is up, ema 2day is down, so short term bullish).  I've only been doing this for a month, so I've got a long ways to go and I've sorta been reading different strategies, throwing ideas at backtesting and seeing what patterns form under various conditions.

Biggest takeaway I've had so far is using stronger/safer indicators and sell thresholds for bearish markets (e.g., greater divergence when both ema2day,ema6hr is trending down) but when things are very bullish, I want to jump in on weaker signals had have a higher sell threshold, and lower bail threshold, since the market is trending up and I'll probably make a solid gain if I just hold through a small 1 hour dip.

The hard part seems to be when long term trends shift from bullish to bearish, where my algo is still buying in agressively but then a long term down trend starts and I get a few bad trades in a row, so I'm working on adding code to hold off trading when ema2day has no substantial up/down trend for past \~2 hours of a bull run. The upside is, that even if I buy on Bullish conditions, if market conditions change, the bail threshold will shift to jump out at 1% rather than hold through a 3-5% dip.

I feel like the 3 key elements are finding the right thresholds for divergence buy-in, sell, and bail based on current market trends is enough to make any algo profitable, its just a matter of dialing in these thresholds.  

I'd also like to make them scaleable, probably using bollinger bands, so if volatility changes, the buy/sell/bail params can adjust also.  Next step I'm interested in is using my code to back test all sorts of combinations of values for the Buy/Sell/Bail thresholds for Bullish/Bearish markets, then dial in the values for optimal daily profit on a 30 day period.  The values would then also get tweaked during trading.

Again, still super new, so I'm probably missing some a lot of key concepts and just learning as I go, but I def prefer to jump right in and put just a few bucks on the line to make things interesting.  The best upside right now to the high frequency trading is it allows me to catch errors in my code on Buying/Selling in real time and not hitting any errors when running 24hours straight.  

Let me know if you have any comments or critique! Thanks so much for the advice, your post has given me probably months worth of insight that I would have found the hard way otherwise!

P.S. Market was super bullish last night, left a lot of potential gains on the table but got about 11$ with each of the 5 bots betting 200$ on each buy in,  I'm still down about 50$ for the week but the scripts had a lot of errors then so I'll just call that cost of R&amp;D lol

2021-02-09 11:23:03,"I've been implementing my own Parabolic SAR calculation recently. Somethings that might contribute to the discrepancy: 

The OHLCV data for each individual provider is likely slightly different, so it stands to reason that the parabolic SAR calculations are slightly different as well. 

Parabolic SAR is also calculated recursively, using the previously calculated SAR value to obtain the next. It's unclear how a lot of these platforms track their SAR calculations. Some might have calculated the values since the beginning of their ticker history, some might approximate it at the beginning of the period you're viewing. The length of history each provider has on record to use to calculate is likely different as well.

If you're seeing very large discrepancies that aren't related to the different OHLCV data, there might be unreliable calculations, but you should also ask yourself how reliable you need them to be. Parabolic SARs is valuable to recognize trends and possibly set stop losses. 

Are the up trends and downtrends you see with each provider roughly matching up? In my experience they normally are, despite a few cents difference in the quote data and calculation."

OP has an interesting concept, I have worked on this so to explain your scenario if you put in a limit buy at $10.25 and the algo takes your order, it is essentially because there is a more motivated seller accepting your price &amp; hence eating that spread so there is still a selling pressure in your case."

2021-05-15 16:40:01,"I use AWS and personally love it. That being said never tried the other providers. Here’s what I’ve learned and done over the past few years. 

Currently run as much fetching data via lambda functions. 1 million free calls per month. When that doesn’t work I use T3 micro for other fetching and minimal processing. It’s a Linux AWS ami. 8 bucks a month. I do a lot of I/o to s3 and store thousands of data files. Costs a few bucks a month. Don’t do any of the archiving to glacier or other slower cheaper s3 solutions for now. 

I’ve looked at dynamodb and other databases and couldn’t justify for what I need. I also looked at lightsail and the cheapest option wasn’t sufficient. Kept the t3 micro

If you use glue you get charged. Check your workload as it may be cheaper to read to a machine and process there. I do heavy analytics on spot instances. Can spin up high memory high cpu instance for a few hours now and again for less than a dollar. 

Consider your file storage type also if using glue. Read the types of files it can read and the formatting. It reads some compressed files which is good as compression keeps the storage fees down. 

Also I moved file formats to zipped feather from gz json files. The read times into panda is soooo much faster even if the feather compressed files are slightly larger than the gzip counterpart. 

I haven’t tried but s3 has some file processing capabilities you can use prior to having loaded on a local machine. I doubt I go this way for now as it’s time consuming to recode. 

Lastly. It’s an investment in time to learn all of this and you will screw something up so figure out how to unscrew it before :)

I’m sure I missed something but I’ve been happy with consistency of AWS and it’s services."

2021-05-15 16:01:17,"One thing to keep in mind when looking at cloud providers is how hard it will be to migrate if you need to. Glue looks like an AWS specific tool, so even if its best for you today, in a year or two Azure or local hosting could be cheaper but it will cost you a lot of time to migrate. I'd lean towards tools that could be ported to different cloud instances or a local machine, like Airflow instead of Glue."
2021-05-15 15:50:44,"Depends on your strategy and your trust level.

What I run now was only trained on like a month of data and backtests years back pretty good. It doesn't do as good live, but it's been consistent. At this point not-intervening is the best thing I can do.

Although, I'll agree it doesn't end there. That's one algo, and I don't know it's ceiling, and it's trading a currency that might tank (BTC), so of course I have alternatives running in the background, and looking for other market edges that I can run in parallel or shift between.  


I don't see the point of algo-trading though if it's not largely autonomous, but it is a fair bit of work to get there."

 I also require them to print every trade out and analyze what went good or bad with the trade. It takes time, but I find you are more careful and effective with your trades!  I know...jeezez, that is a slow way if doing it!
 it's not all about making gobs of money at that level, it's about learning to trade!  Paper trading is out for me, because you have no skin in the trade.... and not needed when you  have someone looking over your shoulder to guide a beginner!"

2021-05-15 15:12:12,"This is kind of advice beyond cloud that I learnt at my current company. We are currently moving our data ingestion process into the cloud as opposed to an on-prem sql solution. What we quickly discovered was that hot data on the cloud is very expensive and querying a cloud database can get very expensive, very quickly. Where you might benefit is having local hot storage (intraday data for example) and some cold data storage in the cloud. The storage could be blob storage or in a database and you can set batch jobs to move hot data to the cloud when you're not using it. Where possible, have hot storage local until it becomes a burden and then shift it to the cloud."

2021-05-15 14:57:41,"Do you have any specific needs you need to optimize for? I.e. Low latency to your broker/data provider. Or in terms of data, high IOPs on local nvme storage. If uptime is your main concern, I’d probably stick with any cloud or major VPS provider. If it’s low latency or high IOPs, you probably won’t get that as most cloud providers aren’t based in NY and use network storage. I started my own VPS hosting business for my own trading needs and to offer the extra space I have to make up for some costs for this very purpose, so happy to answer any questions."
2021-05-15 14:55:07,"Which TA library are you using?  If you are using the Pandas-TA (https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) which I HIGHLY recommend, then it uses a Pandas Dataframe by default.  With a Pandas Dataframe you can easily drop rows of old data from your data every hour.  And you can easily write the data to file so in the event your bot has a hiccup it can restore itself very very quickly.  And the library works nicely with tick data."

2021-05-15 14:51:56,"Okay gotcha, if it can run 16hours without your ram hitting 100% you probably don’t have a memory leak, but yeah it’s good practice to delete lists that you aren’t using anymore. 

If your issue is entering trades late, that could be anything network latency to a delay at the exchange. AWS may get you better network speed, but it also may not have an effect if it’s delayed via the api or the exchange. 

Unfortunately you can’t use gift cards with AWS you have to use a credit card. You can use free tiers to get started though."
2021-05-15 14:39:51,You’re on point. I have used both yfinance and investpy. Yfinance is much better. It works with all the markets worldwide. It returns data in pandas dataframe object so it’s very easy to deal with!

I have a question though, does your code start slow on your old computer or get slow over time? To me it sounds like you have memory overflow if you’re storing everything in memory and not deleting anything. No amount of RAM will fix that, just delay the time it takes to slow down. It’s much easier and cheaper to fix your code."

I’m extracting my prices using the Python-Binance API in real time, and storing all candle closes in arrays so that I can then calculate the indicators I use.
I would assume that the computer stores all these values as long as the code is running, and then when I stop the code it just deletes them or whatever."
2021-05-15 14:01:04,"There's a lot of people in this thread that don't know what they're talking about. I do, however, agree that the learning curve is steep and, if you don't *need* this kind of scalable infrastructure, then it probably won't be worth the effort/cost.

With that being said, AWS (or any other decent cloud provider) will be the best option after a certain point. But you need to use it right. If you just use AWS to rent an Ubunutu EC2 server and ignore the other services and workflows, then you'd likely be better off just investing in something on-premise. But if you pick the right services for the right job and use these cloud providers appropriately (i.e., go serverless), they'll give you the most cost-effective setup you can find.

If you feel it's appropriate to invest in a cloud provider, consider hiring a cloud engineer to set it up and manage it. If you can't afford to do that, then you probably don't need to leverage a cloud provider."

Without knowing what your algo does, it’s hard to say how to maximize the specs. For example are you multithreading/processing? Do you store a lot in memory or discard after processing? Do you use a database? Is this just idea generation or trade execution as well? There’s a lot of details missing."

2021-05-15 13:09:47,Actually not of one trade. Because during the month you can do 100 trades but still you will pay $20. I would consider this as a monthly fee no matter how many trades you do.

2021-05-15 13:05:46,"Well the easiest way to find out is to run the code on a computer you already have and monitor it's behaviour. This will tell you how much ram it is using (or if you need more than that device has). You will be able to observe core load in task manager. (Depending on your architecture you will either have high load on a single core or a few/all cores running. Tbh it sounds like you will just need a pretty cheap dual core with graphics card based on what you are describing. But we also don't know if you will be using the machine for other things and half a dozen other variables.

You also need to consider if this is something you will be running 24/7? Or scheduled to run as in this case the computer will be on 24/7 and hence need to be more of a server.

Basicaly run it on a machine you have. And find out if there are problems and if it is bottlenecked by anything."

Having said that, deffinitely don't buy one for 200 you should be able to get the latest one for £35 ish?

For another $10 a month, you can also get fundamental data, which I'll probably subscribe to as well.

Also, most of their apis will also output data as csv, which is much faster than having to parse json and uses less bandwidth. I'd love to see  gRPC endpoints as well, but that's uncommon.

The crypto streaming doesn't work very well. The feed is incomplete, and I couldn't find a way to filter it. So I wouldn't recommend Tiingo for for that purpose. It was also the only time they didn't respond to a support request from me."

2015-10-27 12:50:49,"&gt; I want to know what they are interested in seeing

They should be telling you? You have the general idea. Reveal stats rather than complete trade history, maybe draw some pretty graphs. Assign a value by enticing multiple bidders. If it scales, if they're going to be making millions on it, I'm randomly guessing they might offer a typical quant's bonus figure. If the bidding is high enough, one could hire a professional salesperson to middleman the deal. However the reality is, many trading edges don't persist beyond 3-5 years, and many trading strategies don't scale to fund-level amounts."
2015-10-27 11:11:17,"Thanks for you response. I have been trading it for the past 3 years. The reason I asked the question is that I have a quant fund that is asking me for details about my algo. I want to know what they are interested in seeing, and if it gets to the stage of selling it or taking funds for it, how do i assign a value based on the stats. "
2015-10-27 08:42:01,"Unfortunately I think the answer is ""it depends"".

Assume you have an algo with very high sharpe, low max drawdown etc. Then all you care about is returns or absolute profit you can make out of it.

Once you add in variablility of returns then the investor's risk appetite comes into play. You're probably going to get investment if you are the the right type of profile for them and the best average return for that risk profile. 

If the investor has less confidence in you then they may discount the promised average return, or increase their expectation of variability of returns, devaluing you compared to alternatives. This is especially true if you haven't traded the algo before as mentioned in other comments.

I think you probably need to ask something a little more specific to get anything more useful than you already have. For now I'd say read as many examples and as much literature as possible."
2015-10-27 05:32:31,"Let's imagine you've got an RestAPI that you can use to retrieve your data.
Let's imagine you receive the data (for the timeframe you wanted) in json format and that you have now cleaned the data and insert it into an array called ""candles"".
This is just a veeery basic didactic approach that could be endlessly improved/optimized: it should be intended only to show you how easily is the code in python. I'll skipe the connection part to the API because it is broker dependant.

    #skipping the part about retrieving the candles.
    hL, lL= [], []#defining the lists
    x = 1
    while x &lt;= 5:
        hL.append(candles[-x][0]), lL.append(candles[-x][1])
        x+=1

    #actually all the above part is useless, because you can access the arrays directly instead of creating hL or lL, something like max(candles[-5:][0]) and min(candles[-5:][1]), but I thought that for a beginner would seem more confusing

    if candles[-4][0] &gt;= max(hL):
        print ""SELL""
        # Code to send the BUY Order - Broker Dependant

    if candles[-4][1] &lt;= min(lL):
        print ""BUY""
        # Code to send the BUY Order - Broker Dependant



It can take you between 30s and 5 minutes to write the above code if you're learning python. 
Now, this is an example and the strategy was super simple, but it all starts from simple examples like this one and evolves into super complex panda/numpy/mlearningLIBs code.
"
2015-10-27 01:53:56,"&gt; How would you determine the value

You need to (or someone needs to) trade it. An untraded strategy is borderline useless IMHO. If your testing stands up to scrutiny, you might convince investors to put up funds, these are made up numbers but for example $100k in exchange for 10% of the company. If you're not a broker and you're not a business person and you're not a lawyer, well then you'll need to hire those people, and $100k ain't gonna be enough. With this initial plan you might start a hedge fund or a mutual fund, requiring you to raise millions. Your algo needs to scale to those levels. No scale = no good. Of course you can simply trade your own money, which you might have to do anyway at first. As awesterdam suggests I'm sure entire books have been written about this stuff."

2015-10-26 15:25:17,"Here are the rules I said I would list below:

Fractal Trading Algorithm:

1. Import the data for the last 5 candles (High, Open, Close, Low) defined by a variable of time frame (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60, 120 minutes).

2. Open a short trade if the 3rd or middle candle's high value is higher than the high value of all other candles in the set. Implement a take profit and stop loss on this trade as defined by variables takeprofit and stoploss. It would also be cool to add an option for a trailing stop loss but that is completely superfluous for me right now.

3. Open long trades on the opposite premise, that the third candle's low is lower than the other 4 in the set. Stop loss and take profit defined by the same variables as last step.

That's it! If I understood python slightly I don't think a simple algorithm like this would be too hard to write. But I obviously don't know anything so I could be completely mistaken. Thanks again for anyone who offers any advice, assistance, or feedback."
2015-10-26 11:49:26,"They generally have different titles yes but mostly they ask for the same skill set. Some places will let people with less cs experience in those slots but usually require some kind of hard science degree and experience with writing algorithms.

It's not impossible to get in, having some kind of university prestige helps, along with a strong academic record. The biggest advantage you could possibly have is knowing someone, or better yet having someone at a company willing to vouch for you. This generally *at least* guarantees an interview.

While it's quite possible that using ML type strategies can work, it seems (to me) to be a tricky endeavor. Dealing with noisy data is part of it. But you also have to deal with the non-linear timing and volatility of the data. I suspect that figuring out some way to normalize your data so you can detect patterns to begin with is the real trick.

That said, I'm just a hobbyist. And I bet there are savvy people out there who have techniques for dealing with this. If so, I'd love to hear about them. But to me, it seemed like a rabbit hole that I wasn't prepared to dive into."

2015-10-22 11:06:01,"Hm? See, I think this is an apples and oranges statement. In machine learning, you have a bunch of predictive factors that aren't just transformations of the variable you're trying to predict. EG trying to predict probability of paying a loan by looking at FICO scores, whether a candidate owns a house, etc.

In finance, you originally start with a price (or return) series, and sure, you can engineer a gazillion indicators from that, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to the actual underlying time series, so you're not going to run into the issue of having zillions of features that you need to pare down. In fact, you generally have the *opposite* problem, which is trying to find enough reliable and unrelated predictors.

That said, in some instruments, there may actually be certain predictors outside transformations of the original time series, such as the implied volatility term structure for trading VIX futures. But that's usually an exception, not a rule."

No, definitely no offense taken, and quite easy to make that generalization seeing the amount of garbage out there, and how the vast majority can't even be replicated. That said, have you had any success applying machine learning to finance? I mean I cruised through Trevor Hastie's introduction to statistical learning class, and I don't see myself just random-foresting on past returns to get crazy alpha, especially because I'd think the best quants took that idea and either trashed it or improved it long ago.

That said, how does one get better at digesting all the math in those papers? All that abstraction makes it obnoxiously difficult to follow, and it's something I think Marcos Lopez De-Prado is very good at--creating small numerical examples and releasing code to make his papers far easier to replicate."
2015-10-19 14:33:34,"You said ""an ITM put and an OTM call are identical. It isn't theoretical"".

SPY is currently at about 202.5. The premium of the ATM put is 1.08, the ATM call is 1.2.

3 points OTM, the put is .24. the call is .15

3 points ITM, the put is 2.77 [sic], the call is 3.86 (time premium=.86)

In what way is the ITM put at 2.77 ""identical"" to the OTM call at .15?

For the same 3 points out of the money, the Put premium fell to 22% of the ATM premium, the Call premium fell to 12.5%.

How are these identical?

However, talk of ITM options is irrelevant. I'm dealing only with OTM options. I thought I made it clear that I was selling iron condors. They are centered at the current stock price. They are apx. symmetrical, in that both put and call are apx. equal distances OTM, on opposite sides of the current stock price.

The Greeks are an imperfect abstraction from a clearly erroneous approximation. Black-Scholes assumes normality of stock prices, lognormality of price ratios. These is demonstrably Never true. 

Stock prices are actually far more kurtotic and fat-tailed than a normal distribution. They are much better fit by a Cauchy distribution than a Gaussian. 

B-S also predicts that for equal distances OTM, a call will always have a higher premium. This is also demonstrably false, at least for SPY.

B-S assumes put-call parity, which as you can see does NOT hold in general.

So, this Greek temple is erected on a very shaky foundation.


As for the A * e **-kd., I'd like to see 1 of your ""thousands"" of counter-examples.

I have written a program which displays graphs of the mid-bid-ask price of all of the options at all expirations of a given stock on a log log plot, and I have run it on the highest volume ETFs. The vast majority of options follow this rule, at least until the prices get down to a couple of cents, and the ratios are unreliable.

Basically:


-MT4 is closed source;


-MetaQuotes sells MT4 servers to brokers, not users. Guess who they want to please then.


-Virtual Dealer plugin (http://www.madraf.com/algotrading/forums/topic/mt4-is-really-a-disgusting-product/) and all the crap having to do with that (http://www.takeprofit.technology/ashira?gclid=Cj0KEQjwtO2wBRCu0d2dkvjVi5cBEiQAMEIVGV3JBXACXDc5quO6KEkC4VrtmLmB1CKAXGyLXIAMsf8aAk2C8P8HAQ).


-Massive Delays when compared to the same server's API;


-Obscure behaviour of their proprietary API -you have literally no idea where, when, how the signals you send will go- (did I mention it is closed source?)


-Badly programmed;


-Because MQL4 is not rocket-science there are lots and lots of script-kiddies making poor quality code (which, sooner or later with MT4, you'll have to deal with);


-Filled with bugs;


-Evil.

The only reason why MT4 still survives is because there are millions of beginner users who use it, millions of EAs and Indicators built of it, and because, of course, brokers push its presence beyond any imagination in order to screw people more.

I don't suggest a specific platform, but I can tell you that in the world of retail brokerage you must choose the least filthy broker's API for algorithmic trading or web-interface for manual trading. (Mind that there plugins server-side though able to transform MT4 into an API, so make your tests before choosing).

cTrader is promising too (it should be on cloud so no direct scamming), but I don't know why my sixth sense tells me not to trust Cyprus based finance companies."

Look at next week's SPY. As the strikes move away from ATM, the premiums of the calls fall about twice as fast as those of the puts.

And the time premiums of the ITM options fall faster than the OTM options equidistant on the other side.

I'm not ""hedging the delta"". I'm trying to sell iron condors, but it is impossible to keep them symmetric, since the calls rapidly become worthless OTM, so I'm reduced to selling bull put spreads.

If the premium of the ATM option at a given time is A, then the premium of an option with a strike d dollars OTM is very closely given by A * e **-kd.

If it is feasible (probably &lt;100 errors) to do so, then definitely attempt to go through each of them individually. You can normalize the data and pick out the largest outliers and decide for yourself if they are an error. If they are either remove the data point, find the real value, or impute the real value somehow.

So mu definition was to make a linear regression of the daily closing prices in different periods (anything from two weeks to 250 days). And then filtered away everything with low correlation (R2). What I have is prices that more or less follows the line, either up or downward. Then I measured the likelyhood of the line continuing the line.

The result of the analysis is that it does not continue. It can instantly divert upwards or downwards anytime. Most likely is that the price will go to a mean in short term. In long term usually business factors affects more. In the medium term is where algo trading makes most sense where your data and signals has an impact."

2021-08-18 20:02:10,"&gt;  But if there's an event that occurs for which they don't have any data, then they can't predict it.

It's worse than that.  When quants predict black swan type events they under estimate it (or over estimate it).  Eg, during the mortgage crisis, I forget his name, but a highly respected quant saw it coming.  He decided to short mortgage backed securities, but he did not assume fraud was in the picture, so he shorted C rated securities and lower, but at the same time went long on AAA rated securities, as a hedge.  This way if the market went up he'd make some, if the market went sideways or down, he'd make some too.  A great risk free play, except well.. we all know what happened.  It turned out AAA securities had crap in them.  There was widespread fraud and AAA was not AAA, but more like D rated securities.  Because C rated securities were so expensive to short a few he had to go long on a ton of AAA securities.  He got boned so bad when everything crashed he nearly bankrupted the bank that funded him.  From his one trade alone, one guy bankrupting a huge organization.  Doh!"

We set this to a flag, to make sure users understood this was IEX-only volume.

The reason we propose the IEX Exchange is that they are the only exchange disrupting market data fees for end users. They don't require any exchange fees, while other exchanges would require us to pass down $2500/month minimum, per user, and also require strict reporting requirements/tracking on our side."

The only thing we do not support via Crypto feeds is changing bid/ask (we are last trade only). The major reason is that we found is that crypto exchange feeds were not built as reliably as other asset classes...yet. This became more noticeable during TOP dissemination. If there are any issues with crypto feeds, unfortunately we've generally found it to be the exchange feed to be intermittent. We've put in several new checks around these issues, so we have several workarounds which should work to improve overall reliability.

I do not think a high IQ is necessary. 🤷‍♂️ Being able to stick to problems long enough is often times, independent of other factors, can decide it. 

Questions that come to mind:

Start with why are you interested in this &amp; are you interested in this as a whole? This will involve software engineering &amp; architecting, can involve data science &amp; machine learning, stock technical indicators, etc.

What do you do if you cannot solve something over a span of days, weeks or months?

How do you handle failure? Shirk away? Double down? Try something else? Hide in a corner and feel bad about yourself? (Not being an ass, but I’ve seen… some interesting behaviors lol).

What do you know already?
What do you need to know?
Are you ok with periods of time of learning over building the solution out?

And many many more, so I, quite frankly, wouldn’t fret if you may or may not be a smartie and get in touch with yourself. IQ is just a tool, the habits surrounding it can make or break it anyways and it’s possible someone with an average IQ to win anyways lol.

I'm trading cryptocurrencies on Poloniex (low barrier of entry and lots of inefficiencies) so I have to deal with all of the following and some more: connecting to the server through a websocket, subscribing to markets and handling the messages (I'm using the undocumented API so I had to reverse engineer it first; not that it's that complicated, but neither is it very consistent), reconnecting when I have to, downloading trades missed during the restart, polling account data (balances and open orders mostly), managing quota for the REST API, retrying requests without a timely answer (and then ignoring responses when I need to but using them if I can), handling errors, computing exact balance from the order books, logging, etc. It takes an awful lot of time to make sure things will either work or it will be easy to find out what's going wrong. It took me maybe a month and a half, but that because it wasn't my first attempt, so I had pretty good ideas for how to go about some of the trickier things.

To get back to the original question, I'm fairly confident my current strategy won't be able to make as much money in 1-3 years as it can now.

I update it every once in awhile, mostly if I want to look at a recent event. The socket feed is only for live data; it's the thing the website uses for e.g. maintaining your view of the order book. It's a leaner version of the official (WAMP based) feed, and it's safer to use because Polo can't afford to not keep it in a working state.

I did look at a couple things first but, as I said, I needed something specifically in Lua/Torch and nothing existing fit that bill. I just used common sense and understanding about how stuff works to design it :) I'm not saying it's perfect and it's not my last backtester for sure (though sure not the first, either) so thanks I'll check out the info from that link.

For now, I only use a single performance metric, and that's fitting a generalized skew t distribution on the log-returns to see if I have a bad left tail. The backtest showed very little max drawdowns even by just eyeballing it, so I didn't bother to check it further. I know it's a bit careless, but the return distribution had just a very slight skew to the wrong way, so I don't expect huge drawdowns.

It's been a loooong journey. I've been studying about / working on this thing for over a year and a half, but that is literally from when I had no idea what an order book was. So, lots of studying, Nassim Taleb (annoying af but useful), Quora (lotsa legit talent there), and countless dead ends and detours.

The currently running node.js thing was put together from practically zero in about a month though, and much of that was about making it stable. I haven't done anything worthy of mentioning in Javascript before so I don't think that's too long (it's a glorious mess though). The backtester was maybe 2-3 days but it's building on scrapers, importers, data models, utility files, and who knows what from the past year or so.

I remember talking to somebody on the Polo trollbox who was actually knowledgeable, and he said his bot was the result of about a half year. At the time, I thought it was a lot. Silly me :)"
2017-08-30 05:44:40,Thank you very much for this. Time to scrape a shit ton of data :-)
2017-08-30 05:23:58,"Nice. A few followup questions if you don't mind :). 

Are you polling with HTTPS to get order book snapshots in order to use each snapshot as a different start date for backtesting? Otherwise why bother if you have a socket feed? 

What resources did you use, if any, to model your backtester? There are a ton of open source frameworks: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks

I've also started finding other open-source algo trading platforms, like this one: https://github.com/ameobea/tickgrinder. 

How long did it take you to write? Seems like a hundred or so hours of engineering effort, easily more if you want to add performance metrics on top of backtesting results like max drawdown and so on. "
2017-08-30 05:02:17,"You can easily get the candle data. You cannot specify timeline, but the 5 min candle data can give you more than 15 days of data. Perfect for backtesting. I easily coded a data grabber, that saves candle data in csv files. "
2017-08-30 05:01:32,"If you look at the charts, it's quite an obvious ""yes"" -- pretty much all cryptos are trending much of the time, Ethereum included. Maybe you should try using ticks as a measure of time instead of, well, time; those huge up/down crashes will look a lot less crazy when you do that.

Another thing though is that cryptos are often more volatile than trending, so try to mix in some mean-reversion into your momentum strategy, e.g. for optimizing entries and exit; this may improve your edge just enough to turn an ""almost"" algo into something actually profitable.

Also, try to focus on more than just Ethereum. Momentum is to be used on a bunch of things in parallel: winning trades are the minority, and the obvious way to find them often enough is to look for them at a lot of places. Use smaller positions across more instruments, basically."
2017-08-30 04:55:24,"I'm using raw Poloniex trade data, including some of the delisted markets that I scraped back when they were still listed. Actually, the current strategy is just a quick detour from putting together something with machine learning, so I wrote my own little backtester in Lua because I prefer Lua/Torch for that. A fun thing about Torch is that it's very easy to mmap a raw binary file as the storage for a tensor, which makes handling trade data both simple and super fast.

It's a pretty simple and naive little thing, though at least event-driven. I determine the orders I would want on the exchange at the moment right before the incoming trade, then check whether it's triggered by it. I compute the fees based on whether my order was met by a buy or a sell and I also take into account its size because I can't buy or sell more than what was available in that order. When a market order (e.g. a stop) is triggered I make sure that I count subsequent trades with the same or worse rates than the first one, but I don't add additional slippage. I ran the backtester on the data from when I was already live trading out of curiosity, and the results were somewhat worse than the live returns; should I be worried? ..."
2017-08-30 04:26:16,"Very cool. What data are you backtesting on, and are you using a backtesting framework? See my question below. "
2017-08-30 04:24:23,"As a followup question to this question, can everyone describe their backtesting setup? I'd be wary of deploying any strategy without backtesting it through event-driven backtesting that includes order book data. There are a few python backtesting frameworks I'm currently evaluating, and it's unclear whether any of them would be able to handle the gdax exchange data I'm collecting: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/backtesting-systematic-trading-strategies-in-python-considerations-and-open-source-frameworks. "
2017-08-30 02:05:17,"A bit more detail would be useful.

Edit: alternative exchanges that work from the EU would also help :)"
2017-08-30 01:55:20,"Bigger question is - can a momentum strategy work on ethereum? I'm finding that the answer is ""not without other decision data involved"" at least backtesting for the past 10 days. I'm considering what other data to involve to fix the decisions and have a few leads now."
2017-08-29 22:19:44,"Now that I think, Bittrex does give away 1-minute bar data; check the Bittrex guy's Twitter for the link to the zip file. It's not trade-by-trade data like on Poloniex though."
2017-08-29 22:09:44,"I went live with my bot on Poloniex about 12 days ago. It's in node.js and I implemented the APIs from scratch.

I use their unofficial websocket API for realtime data and pooled keep-alive HTTPS connections for the REST APIs. I stay under the request quota by keeping a bucket of maximum 6 tokens for the public and private APIs separately, adding a new one every 1/6th of a second, and scheduling the next request to when the next token is expected to arrive.

I have a ""best next action"" method that I run every time I have a chance to do something, and I keep a list of ""orders I have"" and a list of ""orders I want"", then compare. To be honest, while it was working fine, I cut back on complexity and now I have at most one buy and one sell order for each markets.

I'm only trading markets with BTC as one of the sides. All my non-BTC coins are on order at all times, but I keep a very small fraction of my BTCs free so I can quickly place a new order at any time; I'm not even sure it's truly necessary.

The strategy is ... proprietary ;)  It's been making decent returns but it's early to say anything final. I'm already working on something better though."

Working on getting my fee tier back down with it as well as developed another bot that trades a variant of the classic turtle strategy I devised. It backtest well and has been doing well in the short period it has been running. 

I used NodeJS and polo's API. I used tradingview for some simple backtesting, but ultimately wrote my own backtest engine in NodeJS as tradingview's backtesting was limited for what I was trying to do."

2017-08-28 05:52:03,"An EBS volume is persistent and can easily be mounted to an instance.
You'd want to set up an instance with all your software and setting then create an AMI to allow you to easily boot new instances with the same settings if your spot bid got terminated. However, if you set your maximum bid high enough then it should be extremely rare (if ever) that it is terminated."

2017-08-27 21:29:48,"It's unlikely you won't need to touch it again, but the timeframe for when it will expire is also uncertain.

Trends, for example, are robust in theory, but everybody's chasing them, and then many are chasing the chasers, and so on. It's not enough that the generic idea is great, it should also not be found (or exploited!) by others, and that's why it's improbable: because everybody's working on doing exactly that.

And, of course: machine learning. I've already seen ideas going in the right direction, i.e. similar directions to what I myself am working on ;) Deep reinforcement learning, evolution strategies, and the likes of them, are perfectly capable of finding not just your very good algo, but much better ones, too. As ML is about automating *the process of creating the algos themselves,* it's just a matter of design to build your system to keep coming up with new methods while phasing out outdated ones. And it will do it tirelessly; humans just can't keep up with that.

The main reasons for why we can't see those great results are: 1) most traders are not in ML, so they don't know how to do it, 2) most ML researchers have no idea about trading, so they keep trying things that sound fun but are doomed to fail, 3) the rest, those who make money, are happily sipping their wine on the beach; sure af I'm not gonna share my stuff when it's done either :)"

2022-02-24 19:44:25,Alpaca has a paper trading api that works really well. I'm pretty sure it also simulates slippage and fills so might be worth checking out.
2022-02-24 19:32:59,"Hmm, I see what you mean. Also, if the model performs poorly after the top 10% of trades are removed, is that’s problem? If I remove the top and bottom 10% it’s fine again. Are the negative outliers meant to be less than the positive ones?"
2022-02-24 18:05:38,"I'm in the same boat in that I haven't found a result yet, so take everything I say with a grain of salt, but:

&gt;  What's wrong with predicting x candlesticks forward, though?

If you use a stop loss, or even worse a trailing SL, just predicting close x ticks ahead completely ignores that the SL could be triggered midway thus making the trade unprofitable. I don't think that it's wrong, just less effective


&gt; Or what's wrong with cross validation (as long as you maintain temporal ordering

De Prado recommends Sequential Bootstrap, which to my understanding is temporal CV with significant reduction in similar datapoints (similar feature and label combinations) as well as adding sample weights so that more recent samples are more important. Both of these sound quite logical to me, as they should both reduce noise

2022-02-24 16:54:43,"I love this question!

Close/exit strategy is more important than open/entrance strategy. This is usually expressed as managing 'risk versus reward'.  If your winners are $20 and losers are $200, you won't make it up on volume in the long run. It took me entirely too long to figure this out.

Simple test: pick the dumbest open strategy (like a coin flip or an EMA crossover) and figure out a close strategy that is profitable.  Once you have a good grasp on risk-versus-reward, then you can optimize with a better open strategy.

For me, the close strategy was a weak afterthought, after building a realtime data feed, and tweaking several overly complex open strategies until I built one that seemed profitable. Don't be dumb like me and waste a lot of time optimizing the wrong thing."

The same happens in equity tickers, but I think if you see it in options you'll come to recognize the risk more clearly."
2022-02-24 16:31:37,Well it makes you not exposed to that issue exactly. But if your algo has decision criteria to enter or exit trades based on the incoming quotes it'll be the same kind of risk.
2022-02-24 16:20:36,"Thank you, I will definitely check without outliers, and I’ll check the arithmetic mean too. The algorithm doesn’t use stops or takes, so does that make it less susceptible to the first thing you mentioned?"
2022-02-24 16:17:59,"Don't forget that tick bid-ask spread data doesn't look like time bar data. You can have a lot of crazy moving around, particularly at times when the prices had big moves. That'll matter for things like stops, which you could hit in realtime but not see the risk of in bar data. For high liquidity tickers like AAPL and TSLA that should be a lower (but non-zero) risk, but keep it in mind. 

Personally I would sort your trade returns from high to low, throw away the most profitable 2% of that group, and make sure you still like the results after that. Outlier returns are the ones you don't want to make your decision on. You want your decision based on the bulk of the distribution because in practice you won't see those outliers.

Also look at the arithmetic average of the returns instead of just the cumulative results. Arithmetic returns may be less skewed by the luck of the ordering of historical trades. Probably even better to do a monte carlo shuffling to see the distribution of outcomes across all orderings but barring that, I would eyeball the arithmetic mean."

2022-02-24 13:15:59,"Another option is to divide your data say 50-50 or 80-20 depending on how long a timeframe you have access to. When you're building, training or optimizing the model, use one part of the data and then when you evaluate, use the other. Even this method is susceptible to bias because people may start iterating/optimizing on the evaluation data directly which causes overfitting again. That's why fresh new data coming in is always best for a sanity check."
2022-02-24 13:11:28,"To save time, I guess you may not even need to go over to a new API if you already account for fees/spreads. You could just freeze the current model and run the same back tests but a week or two later after more data is added or just run it on the new data alone.

3.Data then standerdized using an sklearn MinMaxScaler() function
3.I do one hot encoder to shape the y label to [y,y,y] for example if the price goes up the y label will be [0,0,1]
4. The data goes to separate into trainin and testing and I made sure not to shuffle it.

Exit if current bar fails to break high of previous bar and confirms breaking low of previous bar. Fyi this tends to apply better on greater timeframes.

For example, universal suffrage was deemed ridiculous since only the property owners were considered capable of judgement of public affairs. But with more access to education, media, and legal system, universal suffrage becomes reality.

Talking about bots, they are always limited. No algos are profitable all the time.  Edges come and go. Judgement needs to be made when to use which algo. More importantly, diversification should be applied to not just stocks but also algos. On top of that, different strategies need different scales of capital, which is another thing to consider.

Things evolve. To appreciate meaningful changes, look at the big picture."

I would suggest you focus on the data preprocessing before training anything, meaning making sure that you have continuous time-steps, that your data is indeed of the same resolution, that you've normalised and/or standardised it, etc.

You have a 3 layer deep network using ReLU. This is a time series domain. You need to,
1. Split your data in temporal sequences, the split you are using will shuffle data from sequences
2. Need to take into account the nature of data; you need either a RNN-type model (LSTM, GRU) or an Attention-based model to process sequences

2022-02-22 11:46:10,"Yeah, unfortunately my opinion of the quality and reproducibility of most financial literature is extremely poor :/ . I felt quite vindicated about that when I read that de Prado very much agrees.

You mention some standard ML practices that I don't think are worth throwing out. I mean, neural networks of course are way too difficult to train for most financial datasets (plenty of other algorithms that are good with tabular data though, like RandomForest). What's wrong with predicting x candlesticks forward, though? Or what's wrong with cross validation (as long as you maintain temporal ordering)?

Broadly speaking, my recommendations (as someone who has tried very hard for a long time, but has not yet found a profitable ML system) is to:

1. Use **nested** cross validation to get accurate error estimation
2. Read both of de Prado's books (or at least skim the most relevant sections - generally extremely useful stuff. I would recommend reading *Machine Learning for Asset Managers* before the other bigger book.

We must answer these questions before adding money a strategy to scale up.

For the latter question, we may use the Likelihood Ratio `R = L0 / L1` where L0 is the maximum likelihood of the null hypothesis that the returns are drawn from a distribution of returns resulting from random asset selection. L1 is the maximum likelihood that the returns are drawn from our backtest distribution. We may then convert R into a confidence alpha using known theorems.

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that, imo, has no real definition in the industry.  People refer to HFT to mean many things.  To me I reserve the term for market makers using tech that has a very high barrier to entry.  Simply trading frequently and fast (sub minute) doesn't make HFT to me.

  
  
\&gt;Is it a good idea to open another bank account and base all transactions from said algo bots out of that account to isolate inevitable losses? (This seems like a stupid question, but I'd rather ask a stupid question than not ask at all)

&amp;#x200B;

Not a bad idea.

  
  
\&gt;How much data is being used/stored on your setup? I have about 900GB on my PC and some amount of terabytes on my synology personal cloud. (ie how intensive is algo trading on your PC/mac so I can get an idea of how much I'm going to be stressing my hardware; is cooling going to be very important?)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally don't store any data.  I just request what I need from the providers when I need it.  I change strategies often enough and data vendor covers what I need.

  
  
\&gt;Is it possible to have many bots trade and still interact with each other (and how hard is it to avoid feedback loops in this instance) in a sort of bot farm where (assuming a well written and functional bot isolated to certain markets/market sectors) where the risk could theoretically be smaller than one massive bot while having theoretically higher yields?

&amp;#x200B;

Anything is possible.  Feedback loops can be scary.  Realistically you'll get timed out by your broker, so just watch out there.  I'd say though if you set up a system that will cut itself off if too many requests are made within a certain timeframe, you should be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

  
\&gt;How hard would you say it is. How easy would you say it is?

&amp;#x200B;

Not crazy, just lots of dedication and time.

  
  
\&gt;How scalable is this form of investing?

&amp;#x200B;

Enough to keep you happy.  If you want to scale up, you'll know the answer by then ;)

  
  
\&gt;is it a good idea to avoid cryptos? Any other areas of the financial markets I should avoid?

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to retire well off perhaps doing this project can get you comfortable implementing quantitative code, land a great paying job in tech, and investing a large portion of your income into a wide portfolio of value-adding companies with good cash flows.

If you want to have fun I'd set aside a limited amount of money and start learning to back test and deploy algorithmic strategies. But do it with money you can afford to lose and consider the return to be the fun and learning you have along the way.

If you want to get rich quick, then there likely isn't an investment recommendation to give that doesn't involve you taking on considerable risk. 

If you want to be a killer algo developer I'd learn to code, get some experience by making projects like this, grab an education in an applied quantitative field and figure out how to land a job at an algo trading shop. That way you might get to sit at the real table one day.

1) Figure out the goal

2) Figure out what paths to the goal look like.

3) Figure out which path looks best given your personal parameters and preferences.

In short choice dealers purchase/offer offers to support choices they sold they fence the sum per their delta (in principle). As cost begins plunging not many days pre opex delta is extremely delicate and every one of the offers that choice dealers purchased to support the sold calls for instance, get loosened up since delta begins dropping. An ever increasing number of calls go OTM. They loosen up their fences making extra plunging in the cost due their own selling pressure making sort of a compounding phenomenon making them unhedge an ever increasing number of calls go OTM. Central issue is deltas responsiveness just before opex."

2022-05-29 18:58:40,"Here is an example where investing isn't hopeium.

If you start a company and sell products or services to customers, your company is getting money in exchange for value added.

If you own shares in that company you and the other shareholders may (and often will) decide to take some of that profit.

And another one:

Let's say you recognize that there are actors who are forced into positions. For example wheat farmers have no choice but to be long wheat. Now a wheat farmer might not be happy with the volatility in the value of wheat. So the wheat farmer is willing to pay a premium for an instrument that allows them to hedge against fluctuations in the value of wheat. Maybe they won't make as much on average, but they can sleep better at night knowing if the wheat prices crash they won't go down with them. Taking the other side of this trade, you are assuming the risk from volatility in exchange for a premium. Perhaps because you are in a better situation to absorb that risk. If priced right this premium will push you into a positive expected value.

And a third one:

You recognize that there is an amount of people who are willing to take on a negative expected return in exchange for volatility. Maybe it's because they think it's exciting. Maybe it's because they are not wealthy enough that a conservative strategy has any appreciable return in absolute terms. Maybe it's because they've been misled, or maybe they are just prepared to invest based on hopeium alone.

No matter the reason, they are willing to pay you for that exposure by letting you sell them high volatility negative-or-zero expected value instruments. And letting you bag positive expected value at low volatility in exchange. A strategy that requires the actor to have no hopeium. But I guess the downside is that it isn't as exciting. I suppose many people think it's more fun to hit The Strip than sit around in an office inventing and selling financial instruments."
2022-05-29 18:45:03,"5% is just an example. What's more important than the actual percentage is your slippage tolerance. If you're holding for 1 month+ you can tolerate more slippage. if you're holding for less than 10-15 minutes, you probably cant tolerate any and should use a limit order.

In my above comment I did mean to imply the opening minute bar, 9:30 AM. In many cases the opening bar is \~1% of the daily trading volume. So 5% of the opening bar is only 0.05% of the daily volume. My opinion is that this is pretty minuscule for those of us trading on the daily timescale, like OP."

So, let's just assume the expectes value of exposure doesn't stay negative but in fact will be positive eventually. I see DCA as a saving plan kinda thing where you may even have a positive rate of return in the end. Then you decide what to do with that.

What I'm wondering here is, basically, how you could make use of a few additional tools to increase the chance for a higher rate of return in the end. Just as an example, another idea I recently stumbled upon is RWA instead of DCA. Well, it's nothing that's based on a solid scientific foundation.

2022-05-29 17:39:38,I would start working as a junior on a trade desk to learn the basics of trading and capital markets if you're interested in pursuing the trading side of things. Trading firms will hire a lot of different roles not just devs so think about what kind of impact you can make and your personal interests. There is a ton to learn about markets if you want to go this direction (in the industry) and a ton to learn about both disciplines if you want to write algos for a trading firm. If so path is starting out on as a junior on a trade desk and telling them you're interested in coding and have other technical skills. They will definitely be interested and you will find something. That's how I started.

2015-09-21 13:49:09,"Hi,
no didn't get a reply, but I have buggered on and learned a lot in the last months. 
I very much appreciate you quote there. This is the essence of what I learned to appreciate this summer. To look behind fancy indicators and to realize that all the INFORMATION you get is news, price and volume --- everything else (e.g. indicators) is just a derivative trying to help you make sense of it so creating complicated systems of derivatives interacting with each other is in a way absurd and unstable.
I haven't yet found my system or my way of looking at things, but have learned to appreciate the philosophy more. (a trade is an agreement on a price but a disagreement on the value as one thinks it will go up and the other that it will go down) 
The more I learn the more I like the world of trading

2015-09-20 22:51:57,"Did you get an answer to this? 
&gt; Not limiting myself to reddit: I know several people who make 6-7 figures. Most make less, though. It seems there is a big difference between basically two groups of traders: the few who make ridiculous amounts of money and the many who aren't making much or are unprofitable in the long run. The funny thing is that people from the latter group tend to be much more dogmatic and invested in their approach to trading being the only valid one. Highly profitable traders catch a lot of flak for using relatively simple strategies they have optimized over the years. I guess that's because it's not flashy enough. Go figure...
&gt; I know one person on this sub who makes 7 figures. I know at least one more on reddit, though I believe he trades manually.

2015-09-20 21:21:02,"Started coding in 2013, going to go live with real money before 2015 ends. If it works on the real market then i'll keep going, otherwise i'll stop.

There are so many edge cases you will have to address, such as stock splits in the historical data, then making sure there are no future leaks in your back testing, then the errors in the data, aka some data will have $0.00 in places. 

Also if your language has undefined behaviors, those will go silently undetected in your code until by chance you happen to spot them. Things such as equations evaluating to NaN, overflows, the fact that floating point isn't correct.

Then there is the optimization that you will have to do when you find out that certain libraries such as the time libraries aren't thread safe or are super slow, so you will have to write your own.

The last thing is that most of your progress will come from ideas that are unintuitive. When craig_c says indicators are useless or you have to ask if they make sense.... you need to watch the backtesting metrics to have a direction to go in even when things don't make sense.

An example of things not making sense was when I would rank stocks by maximum predicted peak vs minimum risk, only low profit stocks would be suggested. Only later did I read in A Random Walk Down Wallstreet that people have done proofs that say the profit potential is proportional to the risk you take. So you could pick a stock with a high potential upside but that would be coupled with a high potential downside.

I experimented with sorting the stocks in different ways and the ways that were most effective didn't make sense.

2015-09-20 02:59:49,"Regarding discipline, I remember reading a few sites when I started and the basic message was that you could come up with some indicator based system and make it a winner by applying 'discipline'. Knowing nothing at the time I followed this advice, predictably, without much success. To put it another way, discipline won't turn a loser into a winner. Discipline in conjunction with an edge is obviously desirable, but it means nothing in isolation.


Regarding indicators, the thing you have to ask yourself is 'does this make sense'? Does it model something worth knowing. There are shades of grey here, for example you could argue that an ATR is a proxy for volatility. However other indicators, let's say the ever popular RSI, what does it mean? The price has declined or advanced some arbitrary amount, in what context? Relative to what? Generally, arbitrary derivatives of price are of no use because they lack context.

To answer your questions:

- The initial cut probably took a few weeks, but it's been constantly evolving in the years since.

- The hardest part was probably making sure backtesting was a reasonable match for real trading, followed by working through logic and sequence problems which only happen in real-time.

- How to trade basically. When I started writing the software I thought trading was indicators and discipline, knowing that that stuff is all BS would have saved a lot of time.

- There are a few open-source projects (Trade-Link, JBookTrader etc), the coding is generally a bit of a mess but it should give you ideas for basic structures.

Honestly, if you're a half decent coder (and who isn't :)) coding is going to be the least of your problems."
2015-09-19 22:22:59,Absolutely. When I look to fund strategies I'll take 3 months of live results over 5 years of back tested. Strategies change and evolve all the time. Heck if you're doing thirty percent every month unlevered then who cares if you lose 75 percent five years from now.

It's not perfect, but is interesting to investigate in terms of some form of automation.  It allows this type of training to take place on much smaller timeframes if you are happy to take the volatility element into the equation.

More likely you are already using significant leverage in your trading."
2015-09-16 01:27:28,"IMHO, data quality is not that important unless your strategy depends on tick data or is HFT. Back testing and optimization can only show you the outline, you have to forward test on your live account. You can't guarantee your live data has high quality as your back testing data. Algo trading is an art and not science.  
Also, if possible, I suggest you use the data provided by your broker rather than from other source. Unlike Stocks, Forex data can be different between brokers. I used Dukascopy for quite some time but now I stick to Oanda data because I'm using Oanda as my broker, even though I believe (not approved) Oanda data quality is much worse than Dukascopy.

2015-09-14 19:58:23,"The more reliable you want it, the more you will generally have to pay. The best you can do is do your own research on the providers. The next best thing is to get data from multiple sources and compare it to try to understand how ""accurate"" it is.

Unless the data looks really obviously wrong, it's probably fine. You could, for example, download the yahoo finance daily bars for a given currency pair for several years worth of data, then build your OHLC out of the Dukascopy data, and then compare to see how different they are.

Even some of the highest quality data I've found will often be missing a minute bar here and there for example. You should build your system to withstand that kind of failure. Of course, when the data does exist, you want it to be correct.

There are also issues related to keeping data useful for backtesting when you're talking about 10-20 years of data. Stock splits for example, technically change the price, but don't actually change the ""value"". You used to have 1 share of $40 stock, now you have 2 shares of $20 stock. Many providers will account for this in their back data and provided you with adjusted prices. Look for what the provider says they offer and decide if it meets your needs."

2015-09-13 16:34:10,"Yeah with one algorithm, it's unlikely to be a problem with curve-fitting. Unless your algorithm is like ""buy if RSI&lt;35.56"" where you got 35.56 because it performs the best. 

Since it's not possible for you to backtest longer than 6 months, then you should run your algorithm against other commodities. If the algorithm does well with other futures, then that should assure you that you weren't just being lucky with the 30% gain."
2015-09-13 16:23:18,"Yeah programming is a big hurdle for lots of finance folks, but the good news is that programming isn't really that difficult and most folks who are generally technical or good at math or whatever already will probably do fine.

I might also actually suggest considering a slightly more ""programming"" oriented language that's a little ""easier"" to handle like python. At least at first. R is really a statisticians' tool, it is a ""programming language"" second. Python is a ""programming language"" first and happens to have good stats and numerical libraries. This doesn't mean one is really better than the other, but you may find it easier to actually ""write"" an algorithmic trading system using a more ""programming language first"" type of tool.

Python has lots of scientific libraries that come close to what R has, though the R folks still prefer R and feel that Python falls short of what R has to offer.

You might check out numpy or scipy, and there's plenty of stuff already written for brokerages and algo trading in python.

http://gbeced.github.io/pyalgotrade/

https://github.com/benkroop/robinhood

Heck you can probably write a system like this in Ruby as well, just about any language will do, but I'm just saying you may find that things that were developed ""as languages"" first might suit you better and have more and more easily usable tools for the things you want to do like HTTP or Sockets etc..

Interactive Brokers provides sample/example code in C++, Java and C# for example. You could use that, or you could mirror it and write your own in some other language."

2015-09-13 16:05:41,"It uses only one indicator. I'm aware of the problem with curve-fitting with backtesting. But that's not the case here.

We record our own data and have our own backtesting platform, so for now it's not possible to backtest longer."
2015-09-13 15:27:10," &gt; if you're going algo, you really don't need a platform that supports paper trading, because you can just download quotes and pretend to put in orders in to your SQL database and track your performance on your own.


Thanks for the answer. This is just over my level of R capabilities but will look into it for sure. I am not sure if I can connect to my broker and get data from them directly, normally (for traditional investors/traders) a software developed by the brokerage is installed to send orders to the stock exchange. I don't think that software lets me access the data it gets from wherever it gets the live market data. 

I was looking for a ready-to-use approach to live trading in R, as quantstrat made it very easy to backtest and do subsequent tests on a data set. 

&gt;you can still do it pretty easily on your own if you're algo trading.

I wish I studied Comp Sci :). I was able to copy some quantstrat tutorials and modify them later, but this job will not be easy if I cannot find some examples or similar.

Also for algo purposes CMC can quote you a different price than their customers if they see you having an edge as they are the counterparty and when things go crazy, it will likely not be in your favour.

You also only have one price source which is CMC's price vs equity trading where you can specify routing instructions/etc...

We are working on more explicit documentation. We're always trying to improve the transparency of the toolbox, backtesting, and live evaluation. We'll put more resources into this effort in the coming weeks. 

As far as the competition goes, there are details on the competition page -- https://quantiacs.com/q4.  The 'official rules' link has all of the details of the competition. Let me know if you’d like me to clarify any specifics. 

The certificate is for our student users who are trying to break in to quant finance. These students don't already have their foot in the door. Thus, a third party verification of their performance could be useful in their search. We’ve already had several of students successfully use their standing on our platform as bona-fides to get jobs in the industry. 

Charging 20% performance fees is the industry standard.  We split this 50/50 with the developer. There is no downside risk to the user, and we do the work of finding the capital. As far as I know, there’s no other service where you can easily market your systems and profit with no downside risk while pocketing half the performance fees.

You'll probably also find the competition in terms of alpha and latency is much better in these markets, so you'll likely need to improve the strategies and set-up.

I'm pretty sure you need a deposit with FXCM to paper trade as well, but not 100% sure on that.

And a nice bonus with FXCM is they have historical data available back until 2007 through IQFeed (IB does not, only a weeks worth of data for anything sub 1hour bars).  And finally, with IB, you can actually get decipip spreads (my current spreads on EURUSD are 0 to .2 except between 17h00 and 19h00). Commissions are 2 bucks per lot (or anything less).

I'm not sure who your target market is, but I don't think anyone is looking to put a quant certificate on their resume.  There is very little publicly accessible information on your website about the platform, how backtesting or live testing works.

What deal do they usually offer? How big do the numbers need to be for them to have interest? What technology support do they provide?

&gt; Thanks for the advice! I plan on mocking up my strategy in Zorro and trading it on an FXCM demo account.

No problem. I wish you luck in your endeavours. And to end on a quotation ""Success is the ability to move from failure to failure with undiminished enthusiasm"""
2016-01-12 15:47:28,"I hadn't seen Zorro before so I looked it up. I have to say there is a lot of voodoo on that site. And from reading some of the site I sincerely hope your algo is not based on exploiting any market inefficiency. Things are now at the stage where you launch an order *in anticipation* of a matching order appearing. We've transcended analysing the past for inefficiencies, and it's now about predicting the future. It's a farmed-out segment that only the big boys get to play in. 

Having said all that, if you do fancy Zorro I see it can proxy price and orders through MT4 so there isn't any technical reason why you shouldn't use that, particularly if you enjoy it more than the alternatives. Coding stuff should never be a chore. My points on demo account expiry still stand. "
2016-01-12 15:21:57,Oh that's right! Thanks!
2016-01-12 15:18:32,"Thanks for the response! 

I really wanted to stay away from MT4. I am even willing to pay for a superior package that would allow me to easily code and backtest my strategy. 

I've found another platform called ""Zorro"". It seems like what I'm looking for. Do you have any experience with it? "
2016-01-12 15:07:18,"Given it's FX trading then there is always Metatrader 4. It's a horrible programming environment and the debugging sucks and you have to implement your own versions of a lot of things that are built-in to most programming languages, but it's free, works with most brokers and it's widely documented so you could do worse. Also it saves coding up a trading platform on a FIX connection just to test things. 

Code algo. Open demo account. Leave algo running. Use demo account trading history to judge success of algo. When I had more free time I used FXCM demo accounts like tissues. Treat them as single-use disposable test environments.

A word of warning however: the backtester in MT4 is garbage and you shouldn't rely on it at all. And demo accounts assume you always get filled for any volume at the instantaneous price, so knock a few % off your per-trade P&amp;L for slippage.

A second word of warning: be aware (put it in your diary) that demo accounts expire taking their P&amp;L records with them, so be smart and snapshot things just before expiry.

Also you might want to look at Quantopian.com and Quantconnect.com, the latter does have FX but I've not used it enough to form an opinion about it's backtester. Quantopian doesn't have FX but it does have a lot of other good features. "
2016-01-12 14:57:25,"Nope, data was in sample but, I set (not optimized) the parameter to an arbitrary number for one pair and kept it constant for other pairs. I also tested the algo with constant parameter on the SPY and had good results. 

Not sure if that makes sense. "
2016-01-12 14:34:18,"That is what my next step was going to be. 

Is there any platform that you would suggest? I am looking into zorro right now. It seems easy to use and well documented. "
2016-01-12 14:12:31,"&gt; Ok. Let's assume a $2 distance stop loss. Then, if the prices are 67, 69, 71, 72, 69, 73, 74, ...., then it will stop at $69 because the drop from $72 to 69$ is &gt; 2$ ?

I believe he means you'd stop out at $70, because at $72 you'd have set your stop to be $70. When it trades down to $69, you'd have already been hit $1 ago. 

Or by prices are you saying those are discrete transactions? If so then your $69 case would play out because it'd trade right through your stop.

That said, this only happens if $70 is his target exit. If we are still under the target exit and are fast enough between that move from $72 to $69, you'd have updated your stop limit downwards to peg to the market price - $2 and wouldn't have sold. So, on the way to $69, your stop would have been updated to $67."
2016-01-12 13:22:33,"Really basic question, are the results out of sample?"
2016-01-12 12:23:24,Is ratio of winning trades : (num_winining_trades / num_trades)    or   (num_winning_trades / num_losing_trades) ?
2016-01-12 11:42:26,A fixed exit after X bars.  The look at the ratio of winning trades with this method it should be better than 40%.
2016-01-12 09:47:25,"&gt; Yes, but 70 because max was 72.

I don't understand. What 70 ?"
2016-01-12 09:10:43,"Yes, but 70 because max was 72.

I used a rolling stop loss too.  You can use a percentage rather than static dollar value but it's mostly the same difference. "
2016-01-12 09:02:29,"Ok. Let's assume a $2 distance stop loss. Then, if the prices are 67, 69, 71, 72, 69, 73, 74, ....,    then it will stop at $69 because the drop from $72 to 69$ is &gt; 2$ ?  

Maybe it's already a good stop loss strategy (I don't know), but what improvements would have on top of mind?"
2016-01-12 08:49:16,"I think this is what he means:

He purchased at $67, with let's say $65 as his stop loss just in case.  If the stock price moves upwards to $69, his stop loss raises to $67 (always maintaining the $2 distance loss no matter what). "

2016-01-11 20:41:34,"I like setting an initial stop equidistant (in the opposite direction of course) from my target exit.  If the position moves in my favor, I continuously adjust it so that it stays the same distance away (in the opposite direction) as my target exit.  I do this until it reaches my breakeven/entry price.  After that it doesn't move anymore.  If the trade were to move against me, the stop doesn't move."

The biggest advantage of R IMO is the ability to prototype fast, Java is better for infrastructure but it's analytical tools are far lacking relative to R.

This is one of the reasons my infrastructure is in Scala (before java) and trading logic in R.

R has a decent IDE in rstudio (it's not eclipse yet) and relatively little magic (it's entirely FOSS).

2016-01-06 23:09:26,"This is how I have implemented a similar algorithm in the past: say for example you have a trained network, trained with up-to-date data, that accepts inputs from a 24 hour timeseries.  The training takes time, but the mapping is very quick.  Since it's already trained, you can map input-&gt;output in real time as the data stream comes in, always using the most recent 24 hours as a ""sliding window,"" which will allow you to make quick trading decisions.  After some interval of your choosing has passed, you can export the data and retrain the network off-server.  A very natural break to do this in Forex markets would be on the weekend, when all markets are closed and you can spend a lot of time retraining.  If you want to discuss the specifics a little more, check your pms and shoot me message.  Good luck!"

Im kinda in the same boat, would love some opinions on that."
2016-01-06 05:26:14,"Thanks for your reply, but maybe I was a bit vague. I ment that the algo forecasts 22 hours in to the future,. So for example:

* 13:00h day 1: Get new data and start algorithm

* 15:00h day 1: Algo is ready and has predicted prices for 13:00h day 2

* Wait 22 hours

2016-01-06 05:03:26,"Thank You for the comment, it is very helpful - i was also thitnking about stdev today, will go with this approach to pick the first market to send out an order to. The sizes are always 'truncated' to the available qty in the market books. 

Thanks again!"
2016-01-06 04:47:08,[deleted]
2016-01-06 04:42:50,"There are 2 things I can think of for you to try.

1 - Check the running stdev of the bid and ask. Send out the order for side with higher stdev first. In your graph, the spike in the bid would result in a higher stdev than the stdev of the ask. So send out your sell order first, then send out your buy order after. If the sell order doesn't fill, don't send out the buy order. This method can be useful for detecting bad / untradable data, and avoiding the trade completely.

2 - I'm not sure how big your order sizes are, but if they are larger than the available liquidity, you can make your order sizes smaller. For example, if you normally use 1000 dollars on a leg, change it to 500 per leg, on two separate trades. The idea is that you don't fire the 2nd trade if the first one shows a loss. This will also help mitigate problems with untradable data.

You can probably see some obvious pros and cons here. But if the picture you attached weren't data errors, someone's running something faster or lower latency than you, and there may not be much you can do. 


To answer your numbered questions, 

1 - My guess is that someone placed a large buy order that ate through too many layers of asks. Unless you have an existing limit order to provide liquidity, the trade is gone by the time you see it. Perhaps you can make a new algorithm which place buy / sell orders at bollinger band locations to try to profit from these.

2 - Close out the trade at a loss. If this is occurring more often than you'd like, halt the system after a loss and investigate manually whether or not to resume."
2016-01-06 03:50:29,"I am using 3 exchanges at once, the total round time to go through all of them is around 1.2sec - this includes: getting wallets data and orderbook for all 3 exchanges. I can get down to 0.4sec if i stop reading wallets every single time - i could do this only after placing orders. 

The execution time (placing orders BUY/SELL) takes around 0.5sec on each exchange, in total 1second - BUY = 0.5sec, SELL = 0.5sec.

All the BTC Exchanges have this JSON HTTPS API - so not much i can speed up here, you need to HTTPS with a HMAC write to the socket and read from the socket - it's just like you are browsing the pages. "

1.  Free-riding violations happen when you sell a stock that was paid for with unsettled funds.  IE, if you sell SPY on Monday, you can use those funds to buy QQQ on Tuesday(or Monday or Wednesday) so long as you don't sell it before T+3 from Monday.

2.  Is there a reason you don't have a margin account?  I understand your reason for not wanting to use leverage and that may be a sensible idea (or not, I have no evidence to judge either way) but you can apply for a margin account, never take advantage of the leverage but still use the ability to trade unsettled funds to get around the T+3 problems.

Just calculate t-statistics (excess returns / (stdev / sqrt(t))) for say 1 or 2 month intervals using your past returns.

Ever since I started paying $17/mo for SierraChart data fed through IB, I haven't had a single ticker hiccup. SierraChart offers new users a free trial period on its data service, so you can download their program and try it yourself with their instructional guide before you commit to purchase their data after the trial period.

Also, I noticed that the Account and Portfolio etc tabs would start to lose data if I leave it subscribed. For instance, sometimes I'd get random rows deleted from my Accounts tab and certain values would change row numbers. Since my algo only operates on open and close, I have a macro to subscribe my necessary tabs a minute before I extract the data, and then unsubscribe a minute after.

So far those are the two workarounds I've had around IB's Excel DDE and my algo is running reliably now."

A FIX implementation is ideal IMO as it keeps your system fairly broker agnostic.

The annoying thing about the IB API is that there's no delimiters between messages, it's simply a stream of bytes coming in over the wire. This means you have to parse every messages in its entirety to know when the next message starts.

The proxy I've written does the message parsing for you, then broadcasts the received messages over ZeroMQ. This means you can just process the message Ids you're after rather than having to worry about all messages.

Assuming you have all of your vols and greeks already computed, you could simply just iterate through dates and display all valid option chains - then run whatever you need to. Basically do it in an event driven fashion (not R's strongest point though). 

Another way to do it would be to create constant maturity options and just store their vols. Then you can target 30 days constantly and recompute delta on the fly. If you do it this way, you'll get a decent idea of how the strategy would perform fairly quickly since you can vectorize it.

There's a lot of money for algos that outperform VWAP, I mean you could become unbelievably wealthy if you can consistently beat VWAP, of course it's an unbelievably hard metric to beat and very few firms are able to do so.

As for proprietary trading strategies, well no one is going to buy that in any traditional sense of the word.  A fund or prop group might hire you to develop a algo for them, or acquire one of your algos for their exclusive and proprietary use, but it's not going to be like some general offering."

2014-02-12 18:00:38,"Amateur, you need to install your trading software on their systems."
2014-02-12 17:28:39,"Yes. In fact scaling out is the reason why I went with Node.js. You could create a tracker that tracks 100 symbols at a time. So in your case launch 10 instances of Node + 10 redundant Node instances for tracking 1000 symbols. It could be useful to have two IB accounts so that you can use one for the redundant Node instances, because you cannot subscribe to same symbol twice.

Ideally you want to have price information from the tracker modules reporting to some analysis engine, which then sends buy/sell decisions to execution module. Or in your case, you are archiving the data to the light-weight DB. In your analysis engine, you will have to write a hook to your DB to call the data on-demand.

You can then have the execution engine operating in tandem with its redundant instance (one that just checks for live connection in the normal operation and keeps track of its execution stack) and when the main Node execution instance goes down the redundant Node execution acts on its behalf to either close positions or continue executing."
2014-02-12 17:16:16,"Thanks for the reply, and those are good points. 

My system works on the market close and apart from managing various profit taking/stop loss thresholds for intraday positions everything operates on daily data, so around a minute of latency for a market snapshot is perfectly fine. I actually manage separate queues for the connection multiplexing as some securities are not so interesting to the model and some trade less frequently than minutely on average.

I believe IB lets you increase the connection limit to up to 1000 at a cost, so even though we'll probably end up doing that still need to ensure we have a more robust connection pooling/multiplexing system in place. Will potentially have more than 1000 symbols of interest that need to be more sparsely sampled, and IB's connections can sometimes be unreliable so need to be able to reconnect/kill 'stuck' connections (this is particularly a problem with less liquid securities).

Do you believe your Node.js based solution would be ideal for implementing this? Any pointers on how I should go about it? (I've only really used R/Python and have a stats/finance background).
"
2014-02-12 16:02:27,"Awesome. That's exactly why I made it for Node.js. However, as to creating a pseudo-subscription for 800 symbols, I think IB does prevent multiplexing of that sort, and the messaging limit is 50 messages per second (roughly 20 ms per requests). Also, as you are aware, the subscription limit for the symbols is 100 (options inclusive). 

I think if you were not interested in timely data, and you were only interested in archiving, what you suggest would probably work out.

This is precisely the reason why many people use IB for execution and external data source for tick-by-tick data.

Sorry about the late reply. Let me know whenever you have questions about the addon as well."

2014-02-10 01:42:50,Good advice here.
2014-02-09 07:26:07,"Hi, thanks for working on this. I've been through R's IB api package, and currently using IB-ruby as it was easy to work with for someone that cringes at java and just wants data. Would this node.js based api be ideal for implementing the following:

I need a pool of workers/connections that loop through a list of securities (about 800 on average), where each worker will open a realtime stream for a unique symbol, wait until it gets a last_price tick, append all data to a csv file (or redis database), place the symbol at the back of the queue and open the next symbol. 

IB has been quite finicky from my experience, so connections need to time-out and sometimes forcibly closed. The use case is essentially to be able to watch more symbols than I can open connections to IB, and so that when my trading system needs to get the latest market snapshot it just takes the snapshot from the csv files or database."

What is the frequency you're trading on?

How long are you holding for?

Sharpe?

MaxDD?

Average Return?

2014-02-05 21:50:35,"Good questions and advice here.

If I were you, I would get a live data feed for $20 or $30 per month and forward test your trading strategy for the next few weeks or months (depending on your trade frequency) using NinjaTrader. From there it's easy to apply your strategy to some real money by leasing NinjaTrader for another $50 to $60 per month and you don't need to learn a new trading platform. If your strategy still holds out, these costs will be irrelevant, but you can outright buy NinjaTrader for $1000 and many brokers will waive data costs when you spend enough on commissions."

Have you forward tested it yet?  Paper/sim trade it using an out-of-sample live feed to confirm its still *potentially* profitable.  I would suggest forward testing it using the same platform that you intend to live/real money test it with.

After forward testing then I would suggest testing it out on a ""low risk"" instrument (an instrument with a low tick value).  For example, if it can be used on multiple instruments, a micro-lot EURUSD Forex account with MB Trading or another broker that will allow a small deposit.

The bottom line is a backtest is not confirmation of a profitable strategy.  You need to forward test it.  I would suggest thoroughly testing it (including with ""low risk"" real money) before making any announcement or writing any papers otherwise you could lose face and embarrass yourself.

While you're doing all the above, if you have time, you could try to come up with other strategies and/or port your strategy to other platforms (such as NinjaTrader, MetaTrader, AlgoTrader, or TradeLink) to confirm your results further.

Once you can confirm its profit factor and equity curve is worthy of further investment then you can spend more time trying to convince someone else to establish a partnership with you."

Revere data sells the data for a fair bit (I can't disclose the amount but it's more than 3 bloombergs a year).

2014-05-16 11:17:53,"I thought that the re-balancing you describe is exactly what you want.  Basically, one set of instruments made money so you take those profits and use it to buy up potentially oversold instruments from elsewhere in the portfolio.  Of course you can hand pick examples where you're constantly rebalancing into loss but I think the goal of a rebalancing portfolio is to pick a set of instruments that should, in aggregate, trend upwards."
2014-05-16 09:35:58,"What do you mean by that? Can you spell it out a bit mathematically?
"
2014-05-15 23:19:38,"This strategy definitely has the idea of portfolio balance down.  Now, what I think is that you absolutely need to keep in mind how ETFs work and how you would use the algorithm.

In portfolio theory, returns are based on a benchmark (typically an index representing the market as a whole) and an alpha (""skill"" or noise depending on who you ask).  As you're using entirely ETFs split equally across the market (assuming you're long - or buying them), you will follow the market as a whole entirely.  Chances are that you'll be minimizing any noise with that many stocks (since ETFs are comprised of stocks in the end).  This can be a good thing as markets have been shown to increase over time in the long run.  Note that I said long run.  Markets in the short run can become very volatile.  When you say Quantopian and IB, I have a feeling you're looking to do short-term trades.  Two issues now:

1. You're trading with the market alone.  ETFs provide much less risk than stocks alone (correlated though since you're looking by sector), but the market travels in cycles in the short term.  If you actively trade (look in point 2 especially), you're at a large risk of now taking advantage of the market's natural tendencies of improving.  As for my opinion of the current situation: now that DJI/INX's been at record highs, you're likely not going to gain all too much more in the short run.  There's been a lot of talk about a potential bubble.  Whether or not this is true, there's some volume of fear behind it.  This alone could potentially cause a good short-term drop in the market sooner or later.

2.  This is the BIG problem I see in your algorithm and recommend you definitely analyze it thoroughly before using.  You stated you're re-balancing equal capital for each of your specified ETFs.  The issue is that stocks (in this case stock sectors) may possess some form of momentum.  That is, in the short term, stocks that go up, tend to go up, and stocks that go down, tend to go down for a short amount of time.  If you intend to rebalance often (look carefully now), you are selling out higher performers in **favor** of worse performers for the time period.  Look for example:

ABC - $5x10 sh. (33.3%)  
DEF - $5x10 sh. (33.3%)  
XYZ - $5x10sh. (33.3%)  
Total Portfolio: $150  

Great, you have a balanced portfolio here.  Now let's see after two days:

ABC - ($1) = $4x10 sh. (25%)  
DEF - $4 = $9x10 sh. (56.3%)  
XYZ - ($2) = $3x10 sh. (18.7%)  
Total Portfolio: $160  

Re-balancing with your idea would give you (roughly - rounded down for demonstration):

ABC - $4x13 sh.  
DEF - $9x2 sh.  
XYZ - $3x17 sh.  

See what happened there?  You just sold out 80% of your shares of DEF because it **performed** better.  Now I see DEF could potentially be overbought and in time for a reversal.  I'm also not stating the momentum theory to be true, but when working with sectors, this is a huge area.  Look at XLK (Tech) and XLF (Finance) for example.  Tech's been on the rise while finance have been iffy (especially after 2008).  Due to events and other circumstances, sectors will tend to follow trends.  Imagine if the FCC changes their net neutrality positions - XLK I can bet will be following one trend or another REAL quick.  If you rebalance towards the movement of loss and against movement of gains, you're limiting yourself to losses on the XLK.

Hope this helps!"

2014-05-15 21:14:47,"Sound advice. Have been backtesting and paper-trading for a while. Reading E. Chan's book, so I'm familiar with some of the metrics. This particular algorithm is pretty easy to understand: pick N sector ETFs (XLU, XLF, XLE, etc.), and at some interval (every M days, say), buy/sell so that each one accounts for 1/N of portfolio value.

Now as for short holding periods, I can't really think of any strategies where it makes sense to hold a position for a couple of seconds.  I mean it doesn't really make sense to me how a strategy would ever have as part of its formalization ""Hold this stock for 1 second or 2 seconds and then sell it.""

When it comes to arbitrage strategies or pairs or stat trading, typically you either attempt to instantly capitalize off of the arb, which requires racing as quickly as possible and therefore you will need to close off the position on the order of milliseconds at most, or you keep the position until it either produces a profit for you, or it exceeds some predefined loss at which point you close it out.  But that could be seconds, it could be milliseconds, it could be minutes.

But you would never take a position and then explicitly hold onto it for seconds and then close it out.  Such a strategy is almost guaranteed to have major conceptual flaws with it."

They've all been mined out. You have to keep in mind that short-term trading generates a lot of fees, so you have to have relatively larger informational advantages in each trade to overcome those fees. The reason people move to lower latency is to dig a little bit deeper in the mine, but those areas are also getting mined out.

If you look at the lifecycle of trading anomalies, they tend to last no more than 5 or 10 years before the alpha is all gone, and people have been working on high-frequency but low-latency trading for a long time now."

That is, after you produce an alpha/risk model, NN/back propagation works reasonably well to help in outputting the weights.  I would run through this site for some more ideas on your interests: http://www.ssrn.com/en/

If you would like to stick with technical analysis, I would recommend you back it up with SOME fundamentals (E/P or earnings yield being one useful one).  As for your normalization question, I think your holding period/indicator used may be relevant.  Did you plan on holding on average daily to a maximum of one week?

The best way I've found to avoid against over fitting is to be strict on the differences between an in-sample test and out-of-sample test.  That is, once you have tailored the algorithm for the in-same test and applied it to the out-of-sample test, the algorithm results must be analyzed as-is (without further tailoring).

How long do you plan to hold for? As a % inc/decrease could be any local minima or maxima that has peak-trough &gt; 2%.

Can you also precisely define the target variable? 2% over what time horizon?

What frequency of data are you using to generate your signals?

Neural networks require stability in the relationships and from my experience stability is not present across time so you will require a lot of retraining.


maxDD is maximum drawdown.


"
2014-05-04 21:44:23,"Thanks for the awesome feedback!  Tell me if this makes sense because I was thinking I wouldn't have to constantly retrain.  I'm not planning on moving my window along for each position in the day.  I'm planning on just training for a position that has an event or one that doesn't.  But when I'm done training and start testing, I will do so for each position of the day until I find an event.  As far as the inputs are concerned, I'm just thinking of them as t0, t-5, t-10 and so on so they won't have a notion of time except the single node that says the window position (which I could just bucketize to be morning, midday, and afternoon).  Does that make sense or am I missing something?  


My strategy for holding is a little tricky but can be simplified to until the stock reaches 2% or end of day or price falls more than x% after time y


I am scanning for a greater than 2% jump but I can modify to just search for greater than 1% jump.  I'll have to see how much test data I can pull together for each scenario.


What does maxDD mean?


That statement made sense - when E(vol) &gt; 2%, you know to trade, E(direction) will tell you what direction.  Thanks.


Also, I'm thinking it would probably also make sense to add benchmark values for some index as well."
2014-05-04 20:15:42,"You're going to have to *constantly* train and retrain due to the lack of stationarity of your fit.

I think your target variable may be unsuitable can you elaborate on your holding period?

E.g. you're scanning intraday to predict a |2%| future jump? which is quite difficult in itself. Your target variable also does not account for expected drawdowns over the future period.

e.g. buy during lehman moment, way a few years to close?

As opposed to targeting absolute outcomes I would focus on targeting return over the holding period subject to some maxDD constraint.

Personally, the textbook approach (you're trying to forecast an increase in vol + direction) would be to model volatility (e.g. garch) and then use a classifier or neural network to train for direction.

So when E(vol) &gt; 2%, you know to trade, E(direction) will tell you what direction.

This will separate the magnitude &amp; direction problems.

The only way I get the same results with my backtester are if I filled at the same day.  

So I tried in R and I noticed that I get the same results as the Quantopian implementations but the SIT package is also looks to me like it is filling at the same day not next day.


I even used R.NET which allows R to C# interoperability. I computed the portfolio weights purely in R code though my backtester (the same functions I've posted below). I also did vice versa an exported the portfolio weights from my backtester to R and ran it through SIT.  


Here is the R code. http://pastebin.com/Qfmip2jZ   
It initializes the SIT toolkit (it's not a package on the R sources) and gets historical data. There are a bunch of functions related to the RMR algorithm. At the bottom I run the algorithm over the data. I use the portfolio weights and plug that into the SIT functions. The histDat variable is the input data in to the SIT functions and it returns results which I store in the models variable

So when I fill at the same day the the cumulative performance is around 5.0. When I fill at the next day it is around 2.0. If you'll notice the results on the Quantopian backtests are closer to when the former.

edit: Here is the summary https://i.imgur.com/GCaXE5y.png. The equally weighted portfolio is just a comparison in holding the same weights in all stocks throughout."

Although, not all of those fields are going to be populated.  I think that depends on whether or not a company reported it/had extraordinary items/diluted/etc. in a given reporting period.

If you're looking for something more, let me know.  I may know where to get it without having to scrape stuff (or irregular stuff).  (Btw, I just had to scrape the Department of Labor's site for some data yesterday—information from press releases not in tabular form.  It's a pain, and yes, it just breaks far too often.)       "
2014-05-02 22:56:55,"I haven't install SIT (so, fair warning), but it looks like you're filling an order EOD on 2008-01-03 and then getting out of the position on 2008-01-04.  The price change on 2008-01-04 explains the change in your total equity value.  (And we'll call it equity, even though you're completely back in cash.) 

I'm happy to install SIT and give this a look.  But easier:  maybe post your code?  (Or PM me if you're more comfortable with that.) "
2014-04-30 10:53:47,Brilliant.
2014-04-27 21:22:32,"Well, very few is relative. All it takes is one bid/offer at a massive offset and a rather shallow inside of the market. If, even for one millisecond, the +/-$20 quote is the BBO the market is required to present it as such.

A full order book feed, while more resource intensive to process, would show when these offset orders were placed. It should provide indication whether this is a single order that keeps popping up when the inside of the market is wiped out, or if someone is actively quoting at a severe offset from the inside."
2014-04-27 20:53:39,"Thanks, that certainly makes sense.

I am a bit unsure about my data--namely, it is from TAQ, but for this particular security/date, the binary 'NBBO' indicator was not available (NA for all quotes). So I suspect I will have to check this out. 

I was under the impression that this was the BBO data, though, although that doesn't seem to make sense. I.e. I was confused largely because was under the impression that the venues would have to have very few quotes for the best bid and offer for that venue was, say, $20 away.  "
2014-04-26 17:30:36,In my experience you can manage multiple acounts as a friends/family advisor.
2014-04-25 23:17:03,"If I had to venture a guess it would seem to me that there is a participant on BY/Z and EDGA/E that is trying to maintain two sided quotes, perhaps due to some market making incentive program (not registered market making). Alternatively, it could be a retail or buy side order with stupid instructions (don't work the order, just park it at this price) that is only popping up in your data when the normal price levels get wiped out.

Do you know where your data originates? If it is the SIP (or some other BBO feed), and for some reason the inside price levels were to disappear, the next order which would set the bbo may be this order that was parked early in the trading session. You would really need a market-by-order data feed to see when the orders were submitted.

I know that citizen pressure can effect change in the government. I know that the SEC has a way for folks to request changes. 

But before we do that, we should probably put together an industry consortium that agrees on a common markup language: maybe ""FRML"", (Financial Reporting Markup Language?) Then, once we've agreed that, we could submit the request to the SEC on behalf of all interested parties.

I have no doubt that there are many parties that have a vested interest in keeping the data difficult to parse, so there will be political as well as technical potholes to negotiate."
2014-04-21 11:40:24,"Gosh, wouldn't it be great if the SEC was a government (i.e., tax-funded) operation and We the People could REQUIRE that SEC data be published in an easily parse-able format? "
2014-04-20 22:57:34,"The SEC uses XBRL which from what I've read is still a pain to parse.

If I do it your way I could just store the responses from the exchange in a flat file and then build wrappers on top of it. That sounds good since that would reduce the data and on the server side but then the client is responsible for the interpretation.

2017-12-17 15:58:06,You’re really ballooning the data up by repeating entries with full snapshots for every minor update. Just diff the books and write a minimal change to the book into your storage for every tick
2017-12-17 15:49:34,No
2017-12-17 15:27:05,Yeah that are the right questions. My idea was to reconstruct the whole orderbook after each update and then write it to a flat file. I want to save how the orderbook behaves over time. So I would like to store every tick. Buy again not sure if that’s the best approach. Maybe a database would be better but then again it’s more overhead since the most part is just write down the information and from time to time downloading it.

Nanoseconds matter for HFT with co-located servers. That's why C++ is basically the only language in HFT. Since, as far as I know, none of the crypto exchanges are co-locating customers, we're a ways from needing that kind of speed."

Well written C++ (or C) is unmatched in performance.
However, most of Python libraries are written in C++. You won't lose much performance compared to pure C++.

As people said before me, Go can be easily multithreaded. We multithread programs to get the higher efficiency of them. Notice how even with this easy multithreading Go programs are not even close to C++. Furthermore, Go doesn't have the library disposal as big as Python's. I wouldn't recommend using it.

In general though, I'd say it's one thing to ""know"" a concept from a book, but it's another to ""know"" it from actual observation/experience.

Understanding finance can give you some insights, but I don't think it's necessary for a successful algorithm. There are lots of other market phenomena to discover and exploit that have nothing to do with fundamentals. Understanding statistics is equally as important, if not more.

I do think Quantopian is a good place to dive in. A lot of it is geared towards how to create risk factor-neutral hedge fund-level algorithms, which is much more difficult than creating a profitable retail-level algorithm, but it's still good to know. All the stuff about biases is super important -- hindsight/look-ahead, overfit, etc. I'm sure you've heard that ""correlation doesn't imply causation,"" but the stock market will give you an entirely new appreciation for that."

  - Document it well even if it's only for your personal use.

You will thank yourself later for having done it."
2018-01-25 06:37:27,"As also stated by others I would recommend to leverage existing platforms.

It may be that you really want to create your own, with specific features and implementing ideas not seen anywhere else. Be it  so, give it a go.

You need:

  - Data feeds.

    - For backtesting you can do with files, pulling data from databases and if you wish you can fetch from HTTP resources. 
    - For actual trading you have to take into account that the streaming data will have to be handled in background threads and passed over to other components in a system standard form. Don't forget backfilling if you need to warm up data calculations.
    - In both cases and planning ahead for connecting to several systems, you need your own internal representation and convert from the external sources to your own, to make sure that the internals are not source dependent.

  - Broker: you will need a broker that simulates matching orders (and the types you want to support)

    - For actual trading you need threads again as explained above
    - And as with data feeds, you need your own internal data decoupled from the actual API of any broker, to be able to support more than one (and switch amongst them)

  - A block managing your strategy. I.e: passing the data and notifications from the broker to your logic, so that the logic can actually act and do things (buy, sell, reverse ...)

You may also consider things like:

  - Adding Indicators / Analyzers (you may not need them if you for example work on pure bid/ask prices)
  - Charting (wether real-time or only for the backtesting results)
  - Collection of real-time data (although it's a lot better to rely on a reliable data source)

Start slow by being able to backtest something:

  - 1. Read a csv file
  - 2. Loop over the data
  - 3. Pass each bar to a Simple Moving Average that calculates the last value
  - 4. Pass each bar to the trading logic (which will rely on a Simple Moving Average to make decisions)
  - 5. Issue an order if needed be (start with a `Market` order)
     - 5.1 Work first with a wrong approach: use the current close for the matching

You can then:

  - 2.1 Add a broker which sees if any order is pending and try to match it
  - 5.1 Instead of matching the order, pass it with a call (queue, socket or what you want) to the broker, for the next iteration

2018-01-25 06:30:29,"Well, you need to figure out how *much* differently you want to treat different percentage movement at different dollar levels, then build out a ""scaling"" or ""correction"" factor from the resulting point data (which may or may not be a linear slope). In the end, this is going to have to come down to how you feel about different percentage moves at different price points and how you value them relative to one another. We can't answer that for you with the data provided, this is something you need to figure out for yourself. There isn't a right or wrong answer here, the answer is just whatever you feel like it should be.

As a tangent, a complication with bucketing is: is a 10.1% move at $10k really 50% more important to you than a 10.0% move at $10k? Thanks to [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=slope+of+line+between+\(0.2,4\)+and+\(-0.2,-4\)) (because I'm bad at math), we can see that using the values above, you have a linear slope of nearly 20 in the partitioning values you chose for your bucketing, so you could move away from buckets and use a calculated score instead, using the classic **y = mx + b** formula. Suppose x = 0.1; y = 20 \* 0.1 + 0 = 2. But suppose x = 0.11; y = 20 \* 0.11 + 0 = 2.2. I'm not saying you have to use full precision, but you *could*. Even if you didn't take advantage of full precision, this enables you to define your classification buckets in one line of code (**y = mx + b**, then truncate the fractional value of **y**) instead of the long if/else statement you currently have."

2018-01-25 05:44:04,"Unfortunately I would have to say yes, it's really difficult finding a strategy that consistently returns a reasonable profit. Trading is a lot harder than buy and hold due to the effects of negative compounding as well as transaction costs. In all honesty it took me about 5 years of tinkering with tons of algorithms before I found the right combination of strategy, trading instrument and parameters. Most of the algorithms in books and online don't work in practice, or sometimes only work for a few trades a year. Ernie Chans are the best I've seen, but still required a lot of tuning before they were usable in the markets I trade."

2018-01-24 22:16:52,"I am one for hearing all sorts of people's opinions, so I do hope it is okay to pose this question to you: Do you know of any books or resources that one might turn to to learn about finance and trading? From your assertion, I seem to have half the battle won, in that I am solid on programming. I am just seriously lacking in financial and trading background, which I am more than willing to improve upon by any means necessary. Unfortunately, my school does not offer any classes pertaining to finance or trading at an introductory level, and classes that are oriented around such topics are meant for actuarial majors, accounting majors, and the like, rather than a ""general education"" level of a class, if that makes sense. 

In regards to proper asset selection: You mention that if learning is the primary goal, stocks would be my best bet. In what other situations would other assets be more suitable? Is there a medium of sorts, perhaps one in which has large amounts of data easily accessible (excluding crypto), while also having the capability to generate a profit if a strategy is properly implemented? I know that can be done for any asset, but I would assume (and please correct me if I am wrong) that some assets have a steeper learning curve than others.

Would it be at all possible to expound upon your mention of time scales? Do you mean that if my dataset is measured in hours, my strategy should trade each hour, as it will be trading in line with the dataset I've backtested it on? (I hope that is the correct usage of backtesting)

Also, as a separate question/topic entirely: What are your thoughts on statistical arbitrage? The topic came up in a conversation with another user, but I would be very happy to hear your thoughts on the matter, and if you think it is possible to begin with from my position."
2018-01-24 22:10:45,"In your experience, how hard is it to find a strategy that works at all? Is it years and years of development before you can deploy a strategy that at least turns a profit, regardless of whether or not it's a high yield? "
2018-01-24 22:09:31,"If it is alright to get your thoughts a little further, do you believe that putting something like a moving average cross program of sorts on a resume would hinder my resume, rather than help it? Again, I am more so interested in the learning experience, but also the resume component as well, as opposed to just generating a profit. I realize that chances are slim that I could develop a winning strategy, and I am okay with that.

In regards to your second paragraph, regarding the steps once I have the execution side down: What do you mean by visualizing the work flow for implementing strategies? Do you mean that once I have completed a moving average cross over strategy, I could move onto things like mea-reversion and understand how to implement that as well? 

With regards to the research component of market inefficiencies and such, is that possible for someone who is essentially just starting out, to recognize inefficiencies and pain points? Are there platforms that are oft recommended if one is to start studying the market?"
2018-01-24 22:05:02,"I am curious, in your experience thus far, do you think it's a quality platform that beginners ought to use in lieu of books and whatnot?

2018-01-24 18:14:36,"Just to give some examples on the variety of requirements:

* Very basic stuff (moving average crossovers, MACD, breakouts from oscillator ranges, etc. - basically anything from MT4/5's example EAs) runs once per tick or only once per start of a new candlestick. Requires fairly simple maths to calculate indicator values and a few branches to make decisions about opening/closing/modifying orders. This stuff easily runs on 10yr old computers and without colocated servers it's safe to say your network connection will be the bottleneck as a retail trader.

* Machine learning for chart / indicator patterns - Computationally more complex but still manageable with just about any recent off the shelf hardware as long as you keep the observed parameters within a reasonable range. Part of it can be massively parallelized using as many CPU/GPU cores as you have. Your bottleneck will most likely be memory and/or disk access to load/store patterns in databases. With huge datasets you might reach the point where your algo takes longer to decide whether it wants to do any trading than actually communicating with your brokerage / exchange. Having fast storage (SSDs, As much RAM as you can get) is the key here.

* HFT / Order flow trading - Computational expensiveness depends on actual strategy as above but your primary concern is latency and ideally hard realtime processing (i.e. no operating system or other applications potentially stealing precious resources from your code). Ideally implemented on bare metal or even in hardware like FPGA-based accelerator boards and connected using the shortest possible fibre path. This is most likely out of reach for the majority of market participants and you tend to keep fighting for every microsecond of round trip time from receiving new market data to pushing out any potential orders resulting from that."
2018-01-24 17:49:43,Yes but it's easier than you think. Your code might not be all that efficient and a little messy when you're learning but unless you are coding a hft it's not a big deal. Python is as easy as they come 
2018-01-24 17:45:14,"Short answer yes you should learn to code, but you don’t have to be fluent. I just started programming last year for work, and I just started learning VBS in the last few months. I have built a few things in that time that are fully autonomous. Google, YouTube, and stackoverflow are a huge help. "
2018-01-24 17:41:50,I have a small team of data scientists working on self learning trading systems.
2018-01-24 15:32:51,"If you make the assumption that the price will stay somewhat stable you can buy slightly above bid and sell slightly below ask price. I think that's called market making in real world.

Just keep in mind that I'm very much inexperienced in ago trading (just did some research) and the strategy that I described comes from runescape game, which has somewhat stable market with wide price gaps. That startegy is called flipping and it's fairly consistent, although not risk free in that environment."
2018-01-24 12:59:59,"It’s highly variable. 

This is a bit like asking, “how much processing power does it take to run the average software application?” 

If your algo consists of, “send one buy order and then terminate”, that algo could be executed by the processing power of a rock dropped from above my keyboard.

Generally speaking, the processing power required will scale with the number of inputs used, the types of models and algorithms you’ve implemented, the relative efficiency of your implementation, the frequency at which inputs or the model itself will be updated, and the time-sensitivity of the results.

Really, any algo could be executed by any non-zero amount of processing power given sufficient time. When deciding how much processing power is ideal, you‘ll want to consider the value of faster execution versus the cost of increasing computing power or the efficiency of the algo.  

More often than not, it’s better to sort out the concepts and logic of your algo first, and then worry about about it’s computational performance. Premature optimization of an algo that’s still under development is often wasted effort. 

Focus, if you can, on making sure the general logic and concepts make sense. 

If you can simplify the logic of your algo, it will be easier to maintain, abstract, extend, and share. It will often be much more efficient and require less processing power. You may often achieve efficiency improvements of several orders of magnitude through improving the logic or implementation of your algo. In contrast, a top of the line processor is only going to give you a small factor speed improvement in clock speed over an average one, and even massive parallelization of your code over GPUs etc will only tend to give you a few orders of magnitude in speed of execution. The biggest potential improvements, at least at first, are usually in your code, and those improvements will often carry over if you later decide to use more powerful hardware."

Its possible to pare down the complexity, like if you only send market orders, you don't have to track open orders. But still, no walk in the park. "

2018-01-23 21:13:22,Shhh! You're already said too much.
2018-01-23 21:11:19,"My impression is that there are two scenarios. Depending on your algorithm/strategy...

1. when you are creating liquidity (buying or selling against the direction of the market) you profit from the spread (but lose from going against momentum, so it's not like it's free money)
2. when you need to cross the spread in order for the trade to go through, that's going to eat into your return. So you need to determine what the spread is going to cost you, whether the trade is still worth it, and probably filter out trades with spreads that are too wide."
2018-01-23 21:01:28,"Yes, trades at crypto-exchanges are off-chain so not bound to block times."
2018-01-23 20:54:59,"Interesting article.

I agree with the problems facing Quantopian, Quantiacs, et al. They don't offer much incentive to lure in smart coders -- what you stand to gain pales in comparison to a salary at a real hedge fund. Also, at least from my experience with Quantopian is that the platform is quite limiting. Really puts you in a box and forces one way of thinking about the problem. You can't bring in external data. No intraday updates on any data other than OHLC bars. AI/Machine learning capabilities are quite limited. They've pre-decided how a successful algorithm is designed and performs (statistical arbitrage maintaining constant neutral exposure to an endless series of risk factors and which leverages a commercially available ""alternative data"" dataset), but unfortunately that hasn't panned out to be true for them.

However, I wouldn't outright dismiss the prospect of crowdsourced algo-trading. Top hedge funds (e.g. Renaissance, Two Sigma) do use AI/ML/advanced predictive models to great success.

In addition, though there are limited data points (technical, fundamental, sentiment), skilled human traders are able to use these to place winning trades. If we can do it, why can't AI?"
2018-01-23 20:24:05,"You should be evaluating the performance of any live strategies every 3 or 4 weeks. But shouldn't you also refresh any models say every 3 or 6 months to adapt to current (and possibly different) market conditions? To clarify, this is not online learning."
2018-01-23 19:59:04,"You might try the Quantopian forum too.

For a bit there ""alternative data"" was a big buzzword in quant circles. Maybe that buzz is dying down?

I have seen some interesting stuff done with the PsychSignal data set, which is free. Other than that, I haven't seen anything interesting or terribly successful with the datasets. Would love to be proven wrong.

Quantopian typically offers up until the last 2 years for free on the premium sets, so you can test them all out for yourself."

Also, can I ask what type of algos you were backtesting in multicharts? I'm hoping to apply grammatical evolution to some very large datasets, and I'm wondering if pairing Tradestation's data feed and execution with Multicharts' backtesting capabilities might be the most feasible approach. "

I'm planning to use some specific ML algorithms and have heard that Tradestation isn't very good with backtesting those. "
2018-01-23 13:56:44,"The network almost certainly has high performance because it memorized an approximation of the data set, not because it actually learned anything with predictive validity. Even though people use them for many different things, I see deep neural networks at their core as [hierarchical lossy compression algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05148). Moreover, they [happily learn random noise as easily as signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) and [derive most of their performance from surface-level statistical attributes of the data set](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11561).

2013-08-03 21:26:55," Funds typically organize as a [limited partnership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_partnership). The LLC that owns the trading algorithm would be the limited partnership's general partner. The person who wishes to buy into the fund would be a limited partner. The limited partners are entitled to the returns on their investments minus fees. 2% of funds invested + 20% of returns is standard in the hedge fund and private equity fund market. 

Under this structure, the investors do not own your algorithms (the LLC owns them). There is no need to value the algorithms. The partner may be entitled to payment of his or her capital account if he/she dies if such a right is created under a partnership agreement. You'll want to consult with a lawyer on how such an agreement could be made enforceable in your jurisdiction. Limited partnerships typically require a filing--this is a routine matter for a lawyer. 

You should also seek the advice of a lawyer to make sure that you are in compliance with federal securities laws--the investment advisor act and the investment company act are implicated at least. "

I don't know if it is just the nature with futures data with the expirations every 3 months or what, I have a friend that knows the guy that founded TradeStation, so I will try that next.  I'm not even sure how consistent the data is from year to year, I'd put a greater weight on the past year's data than data from 2 or 3 years ago.

We're 3 for 3 this week on filled trades, what I mean by that is we hit 3 of our price targets for 3 trades that filled, we placed another 4 trades and cancelled them out prior to fill.  Of the three filled trades, 1 broke even, 1 went for a gain of 8 ticks (x11 contracts), and the most recent from this morning went for a gain of 6 ticks (x9 contracts).  The two profitable trades got closed out due to a new trade forming in the opposite direction.  

So far we're up +7.38% through 3.5 trading days this week - no glitches or surprises with trade sizing, order entry, order management, or order exit - we have a few theories to test out in the SIM this week but a pretty fantastic week so far!

We've been alternating 8 hour shifts between my partner and I, we need to come up with a plan for slightly less on hands monitoring next week, I may add a few more fail safes with the code over the weekend, but I'm hesitant to make any code changes so fast without testing it on our dev environment first."

This will affect your returns.  In addition, you may get partial fills, which you need to account for in your code, ie. you will have both buy and sell orders hanging out there.  It might cause a lot of confusion in your program so make sure you account for that.

We're not tracking volume yet, but should be in our next major revision at which point we should have a better handle on how we will manage slippage issues.

It's a good problem to have since we won't need to have a solution for it until we're scaling up to that contract size."
2013-07-22 08:46:15,"Just so we don't sound too good to be true, can you explain more about the downside risk of your model?  But congrats on a major accomplishment, I hope to be there soon too."
2013-07-22 01:07:01,"This is something we would need to discuss further with our financier (potential 3rd business partner).  If we were concerned about drawdowns we could obviously lower our risk to 2% per trade and have our tightened SL's reduce the risk even further.

In the few conversations I have had with him however he was more interested in the higher risk options, he actually said he may have clients interested in a ""max risk"" model which I think would be foolish due to the ridiculously high drawdown it carries with it.  He essentially just wanted us to take our AUM (shorter than your quote, I realize it is a misnomer) and divide it by the margin requirement of our broker which in my chart linked above is the equivalent of the 18% model.  (FWIW, over the past 56 weeks at max risk the algo does not reach ruin)

**tl;dr;** risk of ruin is not of huge concern, the amount we started in the fund is a small fraction of our ""nut"" and if our financier wants to ratchet the risk to absurd levels for certain funds we'll be sure to explain the risks involved."
2013-07-21 23:58:51,"AUM is the wrong term to use, ""trading allowance/tactical asset allocation allowance"" is probably better for avoiding confusion. What happens if you ruin by tueday or wednesday morning a few weeks in a row? Do you have a contingency plan? Do you just sit out for the rest of each week?"
2013-07-21 22:46:10,"&gt; Over the course of about a year after tightening the SL our risk average **shrinks from the max of 10% to just under 5% per trade.** Sharpe ratio = 4.08; trade win = 47%; day win = 48%

Also you need to understand the purpose of a weekly AUM reset to reduce the impact of a string of losers after a big winning trade.

Also keep in mind, yes with higher risk you get larger drawdowns, but depending on your risk parameters, the drawdown low points can and will be higher than your peaks at lower risk parameters.

[Compare 10% risk here](http://i.imgur.com/n7U46Jn.png) with 5% risk, the low point of the 10% risk drawdown is approximately 2x the value of the **peak** of the 5% risk model.

ETA: trade win % is not the end-all-be-all for predicting risk of ruin.  Avg losing trade = -11 ticks, Avg winning trade = +22 ticks"
2013-07-21 22:33:02,"Can I just confirm what you said..

&gt;Each trade is sized to 10% of our AUM 

&gt;trade win = 47%

I am taking that to mean that you are risking 10% of your total funds on each trade, and that historically you win 47% of your trades?

I hope you like drawdown."
2013-07-21 21:36:29,"Everyone wants the secret sauce! Ha, technical analysis.  

I'll share some basic money management guidelines we use which may help other traders without giving away any big secrets.  Might also spark a conversation on the topic if anyone has any questions or critiques. 

Our AUM is reset weekly, 100% of the starting balance which we start the week at.

If our balance during the week dips below this AUM figure, for the next trade AUM is set to the lower balance.  If the balance during the week goes up above the AUM, the next trade is reset to the weekly AUM start figure.

Each trade is sized to 10% of our AUM by using our initial stop-loss (SL) figure. If we have an initial SL of say 16 pips then we take our starting balance x Risk% and divide by (16 x (12.5 + 2 x 2.91)), so...

    AUM = $20,000
    10% risk = $2,000
    initSL = 16
    ~maxLoss = $293.12
    contracts = 2000 / 293.12 = 6 contracts
    Margin check = 6 x 1237.5 (requirement from our broker) = $7425 (check passes since &lt; AUM)
    Margin to Equity ratio = 37%

Once a trade fills, we typically tighten the stops based on a volatility formula we have developed.

Over the course of about a year after tightening the SL our risk average shrinks from the max of 10% to just under 5% per trade.  Sharpe ratio = 4.08; trade win = 47%; day win = 48%

Steps:

1. Have trade time periods defined, start and end.

2. Find the min of the price series during that time (or max if short)

3. MAE = min/Entry -1 


This can be useful for calibrating stops and the inverse of this can be used for take profits.

Turns out the data I imported from Kinetick's EOD service showed the closing price of an instrument as being the same for weeks on end. It would flat-line for a while, then change and flat-line. And there is no way this could happen.

So maybe I screwed up - but I don't really see how I could have. It was just their data. When I clear the database, restarted the app, tand then force a reload of data, the new data was fine. But that doesn't give me any confidence. Ran into some other issues too... but this one kind of freaks me out.

2013-10-02 12:20:52,"I never had problems with the data being corrupted..which is weird.

MC does a signal based entry. and if the price changes by a tick that cancels the signal, MC cancels the order. So as the price fluctuates between the bid/ask, you send and cancel orders repeatedly, causing you to lose your queue position."

the goal is to code up an example that will be evaluated for a job position. The strategy does not have to be very complicated, it's not what they are after, but I would like to be able to code up something that is not too basic. 

I already have the book by barry johnson, but it'll take me a while before I can translate what I learn into code.

So the idea is not to perform really well, more like to show a good grasp of coding abilities (that I have covered) which I would like to strengthen with a nice trading strategy."

2013-10-01 13:17:29,"In NT, if you do not have enough data to calculate any quantity, it will throw an error message. For example, if you need at least the past 30 minutes of data on instrument 1, and past 60 minutes of data on instrument 2, you will need to code to ensure that it is fulfilled.

    if(BarsInProgress==1&amp;&amp;CurrentBars[1]&gt;60)

    else if(BarsInProgress==0&amp;&amp;CurrentBars[0]&gt;30)

If it's off-synch, you can just take a note of the time one signal occurred and store the candle bar number, etc, and just reference it later when the other instrument is ready for your final calculation.

Most trading systems are event driven (no matter how lagged or far in the past it happened). I'm not sure how it can be not event driven."
2013-10-01 13:11:43,"Oh, I have an example working, but I was not clear. If you do as you say, you run into synchronization issues especially in live trading. If you are calculating A/B, the prices for A and B are event driven and come seperately so you have to have extra logic to ensure you have enough data to calculate A/B at the same point in time. TOS on the other hand is time based - so coding this is trivial. 

I was just wondering if MC was event driven like NT. It probably is - it makes sense for trading on ticks.

I'm quite surprised NT has not made this simpler - but then when I read the forums - there seem to be very very few people asking to pull in multiple symbols into a single strategy or indicator (which is surprising to me as well).

Thanks"
2013-10-01 13:11:23,"I don't know, I'd have to implement it. I'll let you know.

Seriously though, would you have a recommendation on what to read so that I can get a grasp on a couple of days? "
2013-10-01 12:18:00,"In NT, you add another chart series. 

     Add(string instrumentName, PeriodType periodType, int period)

and refer to the various time series using Open**s**[1][0],Close**s**[1][0], etc. The help file does provide enough info to get you started.

In Multicharts, you will have to manually add the other instrument to your chart and use code (Powerlanguage/Easylanguage) like 

    close of data2    
I haven't used Multicharts.NET, so I'm not sure of the syntax."
2013-10-01 11:54:38,"Since you have experience with both MC and NT, can you let me know something? I've been testing NT for a day or so. Because its event-driven it is more complicated to have multiple symbols in a strategy/indicator (say you want the ratio between AAPL and GOOG). It looks like NT does not support this cleanly, but there is a synchronization code that should help.

You only need to pay for Ninjatrader if you want to place live trades or even simulated trades. For Multicharts.NET you don't have to pay if your strategy runs on less than 2 instruments.

2013-09-26 22:00:09,"yeah - I've been playing around with an agent type of model that would view a portion of a marketplace (in my case I'm downloading tons of nasdaq data and feeding it into a db) and let the agent bound around.

As backtesting goes, basically I'm polling data - about every 3 seconds for each ticker (there are roughly 1800 reasonably active stocks), and mostly I've been finding my rules for picking around the data are pretty straightforward - just a rough time-series average , and trading on trend curves. Nothing particularly fancy.

But there are so many different factors - even in a simplified model such as length of time to consider for an agent to react upon, or how long it should look at a stock before deciding it's worth trading into. 

options ""hedging"" is not something I think I have a good feeling for, so at the moment, an agent can take some heavy hits on a bad trade/price-swing.

2013-09-25 22:19:56,"I may have mis-understood your question.  :-)

I'm testing based on number of candles, so C^t = Training Candles, C^l = Live Candles.  In general C^l = 3C^t .  Total training time can vary, but since I'm often trading the 30M or 1H charts, the roughly 3 minutes it takes to evolve a solution is fine for me as I'll have SL and TP triggers to cover me.

I've found that this approach lets me spot trends and even if I over-fit those trends I still find that the overall direction is sound.  I also have a few indicators that need to support any action as well as some other rules to ensure I avoid fakeouts.  I do cover a bunch of these strategies in more detail in my book.

I took a closer look at the link you posted earlier, and it's a nice introduction to GAs.  My own approach is similar to a point, but I think the example on the site is a bit light and naive simply due to the limited number of indicators and the fixed period sizes for those indicators.  That and you need some non-GA rules in place to ensure that you avoid over-fitting and trading on false signals."

I should have clarified in that I'm not using a 1:1 ratio for training:live data.  I found using a smaller training set that I can find a trend and then ride that trend for 2-3x the size of the training data set.  Using a 1:1 ratio of training to live data makes for a nightmare of overfitting for sure. "
2013-09-25 12:00:27,"I've found the opposite in my research, optimize / searching for ""max return"" or best ""equity growth"" seems to overfit the models. While they are still profitable, personally, i've found maximizing the expected profile of the betting stream to yield superior results.

2013-09-24 22:03:22,"MT4 uses expert advisors, and it's possible that some of those are GA-based, but I can't comment either way as I use my own app to do my GA calculations for me.

I've tried a few different approaches for optimizing my GAs, but I find that optimizing for profit is the most productive.  I've tried percentage of maximum profit in the past (say 30% of the maximum) to avoid overfitting, but that has produced mixed results.

There is no straight answer for how much backtesting is required for each time period.  First, each currency pair (I'm assuming Forex here) has it's own pattern and characteristics, even at the same time period.  For the same pairs using different time periods also causes this variance in results.  I found a sweet spot with a population of 512 chromosomes evolving over 2048 generations to be sufficient for me.  YMMV of course, so don't take this as the final word.

It sounds like you are curve fitting if you're getting good results in back-testing but poor results when going live.  A few ideas:

* Use a larger time period
* Use fewer evolutions/use a smaller population
* Try using a percentage of maximum profit.
    * You would need to find the maximum theoretical profit for the test set and then set the fitness function to match a portion of that maximum.

Those are just some ideas you can explore.  The wonderful thing about GAs is that everyone has a slightly different approach.  Mine tend to be a little intense on the calculation front, so I like to keep the rest of my strategy as simple as possible.  HTH."
2013-09-24 15:48:24,"Hi:
Can you comment on optimizing with MT4? I believe by default it uses a Genetic Algorithm. Also should we be optimizing for Balance, Profit factor, Maximum drawdown, drawdown percent? Finally how much backtesting is necessary for various time frames? So many times I optimize and get great results, only to see next week's forward test fail. I believe I am most likely curve fitting and am not sure how to avoid that. "

For FX it's a different story and for commodities you'll have to do your own homework but again I think IB supports it pretty well.

As for scaling up you can get a FIX connection from IB if you like and colo in their data center as well. If you need to go beyond that then you'll need to colo in CHI with CME for the real thing.

2013-10-28 11:16:29,"What effort did you make to research the issue?

The issue was studied quite extensively in the 90s, particularly after Canadian markets switched to decimalization in 1996, 5 years prior to the U.S. adoption.  Since many Canadian securities trade on both U.S. and Canadian markets much research into the matter was done to compare the two.

The issue isn't so much small spread vs. big spread, but rather studying the relationship between the size of a tick and market depth, liquidity, market maker participation, volume, and other market microstructure metrics.

The conclusions are fairly consistent, the smaller the size of the tick, the less willing market markets are to place passive orders adding liquidity to the market and hence a reduction in price discovery and an increase in volatility.  The larger the size of the tick, and the less the volume that is traded but less fluctuations in price.

You should be able to Google this subject very easily, as like I said a ton of research was done on this subject as it was a fairly big issue back in the 80s and 90s but nonetheless here is a starting point:

2013-10-28 09:00:15,"Thanks. 

I was once given the explanation that when I place market orders, the exchanges ""earned"" the money I spent on spreads as part of their business profits. However, it would correctly seem to me that the money paid to cover the spread is not paid to the exchange, but is actually transferred to the (anonymous) traders taking the opposing trade. For example if bid/ask is $100/$101 and I buy at $101 and sell at $100 I have just paid $101 for something and then sold it for $100. The dollar I lost was transferred to the other traders and not to the exchange. Is this correct?"

There's your problem. Your perceived risk is so much lower than your realized risk. What does that say about your perception of risk?

For example, long at 1700.25 with 3 tick target. The 1min OHLC was 1700.5,1701.25,1700.0,1700.5. If the trade is completed in that 1 minute bar, this might be a flag for error, since you have no idea the progression of the bar's formation. It could have made the low first (letting you get filled), and then going to the high for you to exit for 3 ticks before going back down, or it could have gone for 1700.5-&gt;1701.25-&gt;1700-&gt;1700.5, for which you would have gotten filled, but near the end of the bar, and would be still holding a position."

2013-10-21 19:25:31,"It's relatively small depending on what you're doing to get that 90%.

OP is scalping, and that 90% he theoretically has, by my ballpark would probably degrade to about 50-60 in practice due to execution issues.

I could go double ES and get around 50% with a similar maxDD with less leverage.


"
2013-10-21 19:19:10,"I think 12.5% max DD (probably lower) on 90% CAGR is pretty small, no?"
2013-10-21 19:00:28,"I'm not calculating it... I'm letting MC do it the calcs. The perceived risk to me is based on the margin, but MC does not factor that in."
2013-10-21 18:58:49,"Generally, for backtests,

I think more or less in terms of parameters.

Modelling:

1) How many parameters do you need to choose?
How did you fit those? (With future knowledge/without)
Why did you use the analytical framework (e.g. indicator choice?), how are so sure a year ago you would have used them? (i.e. did your model pick the optimal indicators walking foreward and fit parameters accordingly?)


Analytics:


2) The Sharpe is ok, however a MaxDD of 12.5K is large on a 100K account. How many trades have you made?
Whats the average win per trade?
Average win per winning trade?
Average loss per losing trade?

If you were to shave a tick ($12.5) off all your average wins for bad execution are you still profitable?

Backtester:

3) Check your fills on how you are backtesting, ES is a tricky one as it trades on ticks and not points. Remember the other side needs to cross!

e.g. ask at 1500.00 bid at 1475.75 even though a trade occurs at 1500.00 it was somebody buying from an MM.

Your limit sell at 1500 would not execute.

P.S. 10 ES contracts has an exposure of $500 per ES point.

With even 50 bps of volatility (0.005) and 1700 price level. 
That gives you a dollar-vol of $4250. Which is 4.25% which would imply leverage of 8.5.

SPY leveraged 8.5:1 has performed much more than 100%.

2013-10-21 18:44:29,Because you are calculating your risk incorrectly. It's not stop times contracts times futures multiplier.
2013-10-21 18:23:02,"It works, but in real life, due to the huge liquidity of ES, there is no guarantee of filling even if the price prints your target. So to know for sure, you want the backtest to account for this, hence the crossing of your limit. Also if your typical scalps are 3 ticks, the order of the how the bars form will matter. This is avoided by using tick accuracy which MC provides."
2013-10-21 18:09:57,"The Sortino and Calmar are not calculated for some reason. That's what I thought for Sharpe too... 
I'm used to writing these tools from scratch - still learning my way around MC... so I'm sure its user error or algo error."
2013-10-21 18:06:08,"Thats good to know as I am scalping...

So you are saying the out of the box limit orders don't work, but for backtesting I could write some conditional logic to ensure it crosses and that should work right? (I have to do that in TOS)"
2013-10-21 18:00:50,"Since you are doing ES, if you are doing limit orders, you pretty much want to ensure that the price bar crosses your limit orders to ensure a fill. This can't be done in Multicharts, as they use a point system (not tick). So you might have hit your target, but would have no chance of exiting in real life, but MC considers if as a fill, this is extremely important if your strategy is mainly scalping a few ticks."
2013-10-21 17:34:15,"Make sure you perform proper out-of-sample testing.

Also, look at your Sortino ratio and your Calmar ratio.  If those are both also low, then your strategy isn't really ideal.

In out-of-sample testing you'll want a Sharpe Ratio of at least 2.  In-sample will usually be higher."
2013-10-21 17:28:52,"I know right. I think the maxDD is giving me a false sense of safety. I'm trying to understand why the sharpe (as calculated by MC) is so low, while the account grew 90+% while only risking 15% of the account size per trade."
2013-10-21 17:18:57,"&gt; But the sharpe (0.86) is what I would consider low.

2013-10-13 15:31:04,Check Lime if you want equities but it should certainly not be request/response - most likely you'll want the FIX feed. If you REALLY need tick by tick accuracy (I suspect few really do but we all like to claim we have it) then Lime is your best bet for the price. But if you can make due with 250ms (I think this is correct - not sure though) slotted feed (where ticks are aggregated 250ms before being sent out) then check out Interactive Brokers as well. If you need the opposite end of the spectrum (pure performance) then you'll need to colo a machine. Hope that helps. Good luck. 
2013-10-12 22:56:35,"Where did you get your data?

IQFeed.  I download data from a bunch of futures symbols and some options contracts every day.  My database is about 300 GB so far.

Which broker did you use?

I used both Interactive Brokers, and another futures brokerage that had Zenfire in the backend.  IB has access to a lot more markets, but they were really really slow compared to Zenfire.  When using IB I had to switch my strategy from market orders to stop limit orders because I kept getting 1-2 ticks of slippage each way.

What did the setup side look like for both the back-testing and live trading systems?

I used Ninjatrader and wrote my strategies using that.  However, I realized that NT was not that great for backtesting and super slow.  So I wrote my own backtester, which took several months, but I can go through about 5 years of tick data in 10-15 seconds.  My backtester isn't very generic and flexible so if I ever get back into algo trading I will spend some time rewriting it.

What kinds of models did you use and why?

I was doing algo trading, but not quant stuff, which is about 10 orders of magnitude above what I was doing in terms of complexity.  My daytrading buddy would give me so algos to test, and I would code them up and see how they worked, and if they looked like they had an edge, I would trade them.  I would also tweak them a bit to see if I could get better results, but I was also conscious of curve-fitting.

What do you think caused your algorithm to fail?

I mainly traded 2 types of algos.  1 was what I called ""micro-breakouts"" where I would look for opportunities to buy or sell breakouts over short periods of time.  This worked great in 2008-2009, when volatility was through the roof.  When trading 1 contract of the TF, it would have made I believe over $10,000 in a year for both years.  So I started in 2010, but by then volatility had plummeted, so these micro-breakouts were failing a lot more.  So then I started getting worried, and I would stop trades in the middle of execution, and then they would win, etc.  Then some days I would play 3-5 contracts and those would lose, etc.  It was a disaster.  But at the end of the year, if I stuck with the algo, it would have made $4000 per contract.  So in 2011 I started again, and by this time, the algo was completely broken because volatility kept dropping even lower.  In the middle of 2011 I gave up, after suffering huge losses.

I also traded fib retracement algos, usually on Corn and Soy.  These worked decently, but when ags when 24x7, the nature of the markets changed and the algo no longer worked.  So I had to give up on those.

For the first algo, I'm pretty sure I didn't suffer from curve-fitting or over-optimization, because the algos I used had similar rates of success across various unrelated futures contracts.  But I do believe they had a dependence on volatility, which is why they failed.  The second algo I'm pretty sure that the change in the trading hours affected the way the contract was traded.

I could have spent some time going through and readjusting, but at that point, I basically gave up.  I'm still interested in algo trading, but I don't have the energy to take it up again, at least to the level which I did, which was pretty deccent for an amateur."
2013-10-11 22:42:48,"You're only likely to hear from people who are profitable, having said that my algos have made well into the 7 digit territory in profit since 2008 when I started.

Nowadays they make roughly 3-4k a day on average but that's not pure profit.  Expenses to keep my platform up and running such as market data costs, co-location, bandwidth, maintenance is roughly 40-50k a month.

I do automated trading but I wouldn't call it HFT.  I trade roughly 6 million shares a day across roughly 7000 trades which is not peanuts but it's not close to what HFT firms trade."

* Which broker did you use?
* What did the setup side look like for both the back-testing and live trading systems?  
* What kinds of models did you use and why?  
* What do you think caused your algorithm to fail?

This is the major hurdle. I don't even know what suitable brokerages there are! Is Interactive Brokers what you suggest?"
2013-10-11 16:31:47,"The major brokerages will offer API solutions that communicate with their order placement system and your account. You can get daily historical data from yahoo or google, or you can get more detailed data from brokerages and data services. For step 3, if you have an Excel macro where when you run it (performs step 2 above), it outputs BUY(cell A1) #shares#(cell A2) *ticker symbol*(cell A3), you can do this:


1. Create margin account with Interactive Brokers.
2. Subscribe to real-time data on whatever you want to trade.
3. Download their Trader Workstation software on your computer.
4. Download their Excel API software which will install into the same directory. There is a nice noob-friendly pdf instruction book on how to enter trades, get current data, get historical data, etc.
5. Open the included IB Excel file and link it to your account#. 
6. Put the symbols you want to track into the ""tickers"" sheet.
7. When you want to place a trade (up to you to determine timing), have a macro copy the current ticker values (or whatever input data your black box uses) into your algorithm sheet. Your macro (black box) runs and copies copies its output data (such as cells A1:A3 above) into the corresponding cells of the ""basic orders"" sheet of IB's Excel file. Have IB's ""place order"" macro run right afterward.
8. Do the same thing with a different logic to close that position at some other determined time, or attach sell limit orders or stop orders etc to that first order.

You can also do this stuff with C++, Python, etc instead of VBA, and the concept is the same."

""Can't predict"" in the same sense that you can't predict what cards your opponent is playing in poker.  But that doesn't mean that there aren't strategies that can produce positive results.

Your use of the word ""gambling"" is apt; gambling implies uncertainty, but not necessarily long-term -EV.

Unfortunately, much like poker, the ability to discover and utilize those trading strategies is rare and difficult, and the market is quick to adjust.  So the vast majority of people end up losers."

For example, if there was a 2 for 1 split, on that day the price is then divided by 2. If there's a stock dividend for $.05 then the price is divided by 1.05. 

Thanks for the tip about the Ad() function. Didn't know that existed. "
2013-01-15 20:00:19,"Truthfully I'm not too sure on the difference either, just know that the adjusted somehow adjusts for stock splits and dividends. If you have quantmod installed it's relatively easy to switch between close and adjusted price.

It would track the prices, and show expected outputs, but the expected outputs were pretty vastly varied, as would be expected from a ""random walk"".  So I personally wasn't able to get anything viable from it, but like I said, I only spent a couple of days looking at it.

It could be the case that if you have better data, use less coarse data, and ran through more analysis, you might find a better signal."

What happened with your implementation? Were you just not able to find similar data consistently? Or was the price prediction just not accurate?"

Also of interest may be Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay 'Stock Market Prices Do Not Follow Random Walks: Evidence from a simple Specification Test', Review of Financial Studies 1 (1988).

Even with other trading platforms there are already communities where people have been posting and sharing various pieces of code. It would take heck of a lot of people to go full retard and live trade at the same time whatever holy grail system that might get published publicly on Quantopian. I mean enough so that it wreak havoc on the markets. It seems more likely that people will realize they cannot just clone the top ranked algorithm then set it and forget it.  People will come, lose money, then leave. The cycle will continue as long as Quantopian will keep it up but I doubt it will reach the point of critical mass where the markets go haywire."
2013-04-08 11:24:39,"To raise the fears I have:

1) Product Suitability, does joe retail who clones algorithm and implements knows what he is getting into?

3) Homogenous Noise Traders:
 Run all your backtests in parrallel or aggregate the order submittal times and you can see if quantopian is net long/short at any given point in time e.g. the more one sided the order flow the worse the market implications

4) Feedback loop is more or less, joe retail running a strategy, getting frontrun by professionals, hits his stop loss getting frontrun again by professionals.
"
2013-04-08 08:00:53,"Thanks for raising this issue. I think it is important to think through these risks, and I appreciate the criticism. I work at Quantopian, so I wanted to offer a few clarifications and questions:

1. Users own their algos and the code is private - the sharing you see in the forums is on public papers or other non-proprietary info. I mention this because I don't see the forums leading to mass replication. 

2. We aren't doing high frequency. The market data is in minute or day bars, and we're looking to build a platform that is good for analyzing non-market data (fundamental, economic, social, etc). Lower frequency has a much lower concentration of algorithmic investors, and I see us pushing 

3. Do you think looking at correlations between algorithms' backtest returns in aggregate could defend against the feedback loop? Maybe parallel simulation? Or is there a way we could run a simulation that approximates the feedback loop? 

4. I'm assuming the effect you're calling feedback loop is the akin to the summer '07 quant crash, where one fund unwinding positions triggered a cascade of liquidations among similar funds. Is that what you mean?

thanks again,

2013-04-07 21:41:56,"Looking at the sort of algorithms the Quantopians are coming up with presently, I'm not that too worried.

Figuring out a market beating strategy isn't easy. There are known sources of alpha, but generating new ones is incredibly hard. Without institutional support and/or brilliant insight, I highly doubt many can come up with a truly good strategy that can affect the market's mechanics.

If it ever becomes public and highly profitable, institutions will front run these algorithms or even just make the strategy inefficient (market efficiency). Retails never had a chance to begin with following public strategies."

2) Loss of confidence from those that get frontran/retail investors opening a can of worms.

2013-04-07 20:41:17,"I may have editorialized the headline with destroy markets, but if you read the original post, it's more about the retail joe's who throw their money behind algo's only to be frontrun, outgunned and lose their money, and the increase in volatility that may happen due to noise traders all doing the same thing.

"
2013-04-07 20:36:12,"I think you are drastically overestimating the impact and survivability of quantopian as a concept, or that of any of its competitors for that matter. I might even go so far as to say that the entire idea is absurd and doomed to fail, if its goal is even to succeed in the first place... of which I have my doubts.

Where to begin?! Cloud based algorithm backtesting? Fucking ridiculous. I would not trust the cloud with anything of value and anyone with skin in the game knows that all the value is in IP. Trust is of the utmost importance and having someone else be privy to your backtests undermines its privacy (hence its value) and makes it vulnerable to poaching or security breaches. The fact that quantopians website says ""we will keep your algorithm private"" doesnt count for  shit, there have been numerous cases of companies violating their EULA and those are just the instances that reach the media, I would bet that the occurance of this are for more widespread than reported. 

Assuming that your algorithm is safe and sound. Then there comes the next problem: Why even use Quantopian in the first place? Any halfway successful algorithm writer doesnt actually need to use their python backtester. Hell many write their own backtesters from scratch. These are the individuals Quantopian hopes to make money off of one day through brokerage fees, but brokerages out there already offer access to backtesters and if Quantopians response to that is ""Well we scrub the data for you"" then I would respond with ""Well if I cant scrub it myself then I wont go far in this industry anyway"". The only thing Quantopian has going for itself is the fact that it is trying to build a python library. 

There is so much more that is wrong with this idea but I dont have all night so lastly I will just touch one one thing: credibility. A quick glance at Quantopians *about* page reveals some of their backers:                          
Getco, a HFT market maker. Gee I wonder what interest they could have in a company that provides services like Quantopian currently does and hopes to in the future. Their website states: *""GETCO is one of the top-performing DMMs on the floor of the NYSE""* which is funny since a quick google search links to news articles of Getco profits dropping 80% last year.                         
B.D: Co-Founder and former CEO at ______ investing aka _____ which ""offers innovative value investing strategies based on the fundamental value discipline developed by _______________"". More room for conflict of interest IMO.

M.G, former cohead of research at B.A, where his job was to: ""created new systems for generating alpha, produced daily trading signals"" (from his linkedin page).....really???                                   
So as you can see, there is lots of room for fuckery to take place, I am not saying it will, just that I would not be the least bit surprised if it turns out to be that quantopian or topsteptrader or any other similar idea just serves to farm ideas or find victims to frontrun.                                                     
So yea I dont think quantopian is anything to worry about, there needs to be a loser or group of losers in every zero sum game and the collective momentum of multiple implementations of the same strategy wont be able to adversely affect the market.                                                     
Its not that I think your idea of the feedback loop is wrong, its just misdirected. Market participants need to be aware of the risk posed by the feedback loop from large groups of hedge funds unwinding similar positions as we saw not too long or ago, or of HFT algorithms stampeding like when united airline stock crashed 80% in 15 minutes a few years back, or liquidity evaporation, or toxic flow or etc etc etc... thats the kind of feedback investors need to be aware of. Market efficiency might lead to the corrections, but that only after the damage has been done. "

It's not that quantopian will cause a microstructure issue, its the fact that its going to increase homogenous expectations. I was using the microstructure example to illustrate the problem on a small level.

I've done a lot of work on market clearing under various types of agent expectations and the more homogenous expectations are without some form of informational edge (homogenous noise traders), volatility increases and liquidity decreases as the book keeps on getting walked in spikes.

I'm not saying its going to cause catastrophic damage, what I am saying is that this project has no positive outcome for markets and it allows people to trade using models they do not comprehend.

2013-04-07 00:49:05,"The argument for it is more from an order flow/expectations stand point, if we start to introduce a flood of identical trades each generated at the same point in time it's going to run the book.

I will probably one of the first in line to identify which ones of these are implemented by large groups.

I've done microstructure simulations under homogenous price expectations and to put it simply markets don't clear, if you add a bit of noise at the time in which their trades are entered we end up with see saw like effects in terms of price.

Heterogenous expectations allow markets to clear in a stable manner, homogeneity in order flow/expectations without some informational edge add nothing to the efficiency of markets.

The difference between this and turtle is in terms of everyone running the same algos, hosted on the same servers, implemented through the same API submitted orders at the same time. At least for turtle you can screw up implementation a lot easier.

2013-03-29 10:00:31,"You should always compare your method to a benchmark.  For instance you could use the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones.

If you are not trading equity securities or your pool of equities does not compare well to S&amp;P then you will have to construct a different benchmark.

For instance you could make a benchmark by looking at the performance of a ""buy and hold"" strategy within your pool of securities.  The simplest would be to buy all of them and track the percentage returns.   More complicated would be a Monte Carlo analysis of buying and selling once a year.  In which case you will have a benchmark that is a *distribution* of return percentages.

Can your method beat the simple buy and hold benchmark?  Can it beat the mean (average) Monte Carlo benchmark?  If so, does it beat 1 standard deviation above the mean?

Be sure to add commission fees and slippage to your backtest.  It's also wise to limit your buying capacity to 1/4 of the available volume for the particular security that day.  If you are buying on margin or short selling then you need to understand the fees associated with that as well.  And remember to use *adjusted daily prices* that properly adjust for dividends and splits (this will affect volume as well).  With these constraints you may find that your method performs better with larger or smaller starting capital.

For-Ex would need a similar benchmark.  Perhaps a Monte Carlo analysis with daily buy/sell choices.

In all cases, regardless of the type of benchmark, you must compare your method and benchmark over the same time period.  It is also helpful to run multiple time periods and build a distribution of percentage returns for your method and benchmark.  How do they compare?  Which is wider (standard deviation) and which is higher (mean)? 

There are other ways to evaluate your method.  What is the maximum drawdown?  How risky or volatile is your method?  In other words how much capital do you need to survive a rough start?  Some methods are more or less risky than others (independent of mean percentage returns).

Does your method have money management (aka position sizing) built in?  Or is it only providing buy/sell signals?  This can drastically affect your overall return.

2013-03-27 16:52:29,"Just to expand on your first point slightly. Optimization whether exhaustive or otherwise isn't the *cause* of curve-fitting, but a curve fit system is far more likely to result from optimization. If you can get your hands on it, look at the chapter on Optimization and whether it's a good idea in Way of the Turtle - it explains that although optimization causes issues (such as curve-fitting), it's still absolutely essential and far more valuable than the alternative (trading an un-optimized system).

Remember, it's completely possible to create a curve-fit system on the first try, prior to optimizing. Optimization doesn't cause curve-fitting, but it is very good at identifying code or parameters that are curve-fit. This is why you need to research ways by which you can identify curve-fit systems and validate your backtest/optimization results properly. "
2013-03-27 16:33:42,"I find looking at the distribution of returns incredibly helpful when assessing performance - that and equity curve. You might need to create a framework in excel if your software package doesn't provide it. What software are you using?

IS and OOS are in-sample and out-of-sample periods. Strictly speaking, you should optimize over the in-sample period (any period you like as long as it predates the out-of-sample period). The results of the optimization are then used to test over the OOS period - the results of this test provide information as to the likely performance of the system. The IS results provide (arguably) very little information as to the performance. Essentially it's a technique to avoid curve-fitting your code. Walk-forward testing is the use of cycling IS and OOS periods. You should look into it as it relates fairly well to your initial question. Howard Bandy writes very good stuff on quantitative systems, IS and OOS and ensuring your system is statistically valid. 

My other point - time shouldn't matter because unless you're optimizing tens of thousands of permutations your software should be able to do it in a reasonable timeframe (certainly not unfeasible). And if you are optimizing over that many permutations, you should be aware that an awful lot of the results will be made meaningless by the lack of resulting frequency (sample size).

What software are you using, and how many permutations are you optimizing for? "
2013-03-27 15:31:44,"I don't know how to answer that, but it's a good point and it does emphasize the importance of performing re-evaluations and re-optimizations at regular intervals."
2013-03-27 14:45:50,[deleted]
2013-03-27 13:46:26,"Interesting, I hadn't really thought of setting up the results in a probability distribution. Also, could you elaborate on your fifth point? What are IS and OOS periods?

I'm optimizing an existing system, a trading strategy, but why shouldn't time matter? Shouldn't you ideally optimize and test your model on a regular basis before using it on live data?"
2013-03-27 13:41:42,"Yes, but shouldn't you ideally train your model on a very large sample compared to your out of sample range?"
2013-03-27 13:40:10,"Yes it seems you are right. It doesn't look like the problem of over-fitting comes from exhaustively scanning every possibility. Instead it's mainly caused by:
a) Allowing the model to have too many parameters as you have said, therefore allowing noisy events to influence more easily your fitness criteria.
b) Not performing an optimization on a large enough sample range, in which case there is the possibility of a large shock having a misleading influence on your fitness criteria. 

However, I don't think I agree with the idea that processing time doesn't matter. There's probably some trade-off between an exhaustive search and other heuristic methods for time and thoroughness. In this case that would seem to be the only disadvantage to using an exhaustive search over other optimization approaches (although one could bring up it's simplicity)."
2013-03-27 13:23:52,"Maybe I've misunderstood. The ""exhaustive approach to optimization"" to me implied a technique that I use and not simple optimization of variables. Anyway, we'll see. "
2013-03-27 13:18:18,[deleted]
2013-03-27 13:16:13,"It's hard to say without knowing what you're doing. Optimization is certainly the easiest way to arrive at a curve fit piece of code, so you need to take steps to ensure (as much as you can) that what it's tuned to is information and not noise.

Some of the things you need to consider:

1) frequency (or # of optimization results)

2) distribution of returns (long tails, skew etc)

3) simplicity of code / number of separate parameters

4) equity curve consistency

5) use of IS and OOS periods

6) existence of outliers in the results 

Why are you optimizing? Do you have an existing system which you're optimizing (in which case processing time shouldn't really matter), or are you analyzing price behavior in general to see what's interesting?"
2013-03-27 12:53:06,"I agree completely, but that's not what OP's asking. 

Exhaustive optimization is often used to identify areas for research, not as the basis for finalized systems. I assume OP isn't creating a system with so many parameters that he can't optimize it, but is using it as a tool to identify areas to study.

2013-03-27 12:24:04,"&gt;I doubt it is unfeasible. Processing power is cheap. I can't imagine it taking more than a day or two to test even an extremely exhaustive set with terabytes of data.

This isn't really true. Because of the compounding effect of adding each new parameter it's incredibly easy to create runs which require weeks, months or years (and upwards) of processing time. Like cracking hashes, large increases in processing power (using the cloud for example), have a relatively small effect. If processing time follows an exponential curve as you add parameters, you reach a point fairly quickly where any realistic increase in technology or processing speed becomes moot.

2017-07-08 23:52:25,"Well, it's interesting in so far as the statistical underpinnings are concerned.

So when we try to assign how likely a probability of an event is to occur, we are left with statistics that have underpinnings dating back almost 200 years. 

So the notion of a Z , the standard deviation, is predicated on the notion that a given data sets will behave along the lines of a bell curve or some particular shape. The ""midpoint"" being items more common , the outer fringes being less common.

This research suggests this is not true, and so you basically could have substantial amounts of this community as well as large portions of the statistical / quantitative trading body of word - being effectively worthless.

This of course this not the first time some massively cherished notion has proven to be flawed - if not in total, in a serious way.

In formal options trading (IIRC) the [Black–Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) (an early algorithm developed in the 1970's to price options) has a serious couple of flaws - along these same lines , where by a ""fat tail"" - or a higher than expected occurrence of events which should be ""rare"" by virtue of the way the pure statistical math suggests it should be. A really interesting couple of books on this subject are ""My Life as a Quant"" and ""Models Behaving Badly"" both by Emanuel Derman.

So lets say the odds of a price of X for some stock , hovers around 20$ per share. The 99% percentile suggests the price doesn't deviate from this by more than 30% so lets say the price with a 99% confidence is 20$ +/- 7$ so you do not expect a price below 13 dollars or above 27 dollars expect perhaps rarely.

Rarely is the key word. It depends entirely how you measure things. So it's massively important to understand that 99% of the time, that model should stay in that box. The problem occurs when ""reality"" shows that the model doesn't do that. So if you peak out at 30$ or dip below 5$, this should be an exceedingly rare event, but if it happens 2 or 3 times a day - rare is a relative term. 

Rare - in this context is a tricky term for another reason, since it implies you have some regular ""X"" measurement across time, which stocks may not have. So unlike some academic or some other real world examples the stock-market suffers from a [Fat Tail.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution)

In formal [Statistical Process Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control), such things are VERY thoroughly considered, and statistical control processes are usually very, very good at predicting exceptions to a model. 

Bottom line, in stocks, (according to this research) there is greater risk than we currently assign, as pretty much anyone who's watched the market professionally or even as an amateur might intuit a similar result. "

2017-07-06 14:59:11,"This is the same answer as in quant.stackexchange

&gt; 1. What has changed

The API is gone. The new downloads need 1st to parse the Yahoo Finance page to find a hidden *crumb* and use it as the key for data retrieval over a 2nd URL.

The adjusted close is sometimes the adjusted, sometimes is the non-adjusted and sometimes is a different value

Lines with literally *""null""* as the value for the prices have been inserted. Apparently this sometimes only affects the *volume*

Sometimes changes will appear across a single download of data.

Splits and dividends are for example apparently no longer applied to some of the values

&gt; 2. What exactly about the quality of the data has changed (or that changes appear sporadically without explanation, which would be bad)
What about the data described has changed (is it adjusted as it was before, or are dividends no longer adjusted for, putting Yahoo! Finance on part with Google Finance)

Having a lot of *""sometimes""* as seen above is for sure no synonym of quality

&gt; 3. What about the data described has changed (is it adjusted as it was before, or are dividends no longer adjusted for, putting Yahoo! Finance on part with Google Finance)

See above again

&gt; 4. Whether Yahoo! Finance should be the go-to source for free equities data now, or whether Google Finance/Quandl are now superior

It is obviously no longer usable without a prior analysis from your side. Anything else seems to be a better choice now.

For reference see for example:

  - https://community.backtrader.com/topic/432/yahoofinance-data-feeds/
  - https://community.backtrader.com/topic/516/yahoofinancedata-gets-displayed-invalid-due-to-changed-adjusted-close/
  - https://community.backtrader.com/topic/411/attributeerror-nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-close/

**Note**: Understanding that Yahoo may have not been happy about people downloading (and possibly redistributing) data for (a) f(r)ee, how Yahoo did it shows what Yahoo is up for: a web page that said that engineers were working on the problem. There was obviously no problem and a page indicating that the service was no longer available would have been the right way to go.

**Update**: And some tickers like YHOO (surprise, surprise) seem to no longer be available (try for example YHOO.MX for something that works)

2017-07-06 12:20:06,By definition you need a lookback period of some sort since its related to how the price changes which requires current price + previous price(s).  It would be like asking how to get an average without a lookback period.

  - Decouple platform and language. Choose a language first and then look for the platform that suits you
  - Assume that you do it with Excel, because you feel that your programming skills are not enough (at least not yet)

There is not **best** language, but if you have to polish your programming skills I would them opt for

  - Python
  - Or else R (but I would first go for Python)

Those would be the most ""efficient"" for your case. You may still opt for C#, C++.

Platforms. First the different setups:

  - Hosted and managed by a 3rd party
  - Own setup

The difference being, that in the 1st case and being the hosted setup managed by a company, you will be expecting some level of support, whereas with your *own setup* you may expect best effort support from the communities associated to the package of your choosing (things will still work or else, there wouldn't be a community)

**Hosted**

  - If we look at Python, there is a clear winner: `Quantopian`. It's the networking effect.
  - You may also try `Quantiacs` for Python
  - Or also `cloudquant` which is getting into this market lately
  - For C# you can go to `QuantConnect`

**Own Setup**

  - R has the Quantstrat package
  - For Python there are many. Quick listing of 3 which have been discussed together in some threads here
    - `backtrader` (**Disclaimer**: my own)
    - `pyalgotrade`
    - `zipline` (the python package used by Quantopian)

Imho: python may not be the fastest (it isn't) but will allow you to be *efficient* and *effective*

Decide what you want the annual volatilty of your portfolio to be- a comfortable max is 25%, which is pretty damn scary cause you'll have the occasional 8% drop in a day. If your capital is 100k, that's 25k.

Divide that by sqrt(252), where 252 is the number of business days in the year.

That'll give you your daily volatilty target.

Calculate the daily volatilty of your strategy with fixed capital, and divide that into the daily volatilty target. Basically use that multiple to scale your strategy to fit inside the daily volatilty target. 

The expected annual return is then the sharpe ratio * annual volatilty target."

If a firm's strategies are very time sensitive you do not have time to ship trading instructions to the facility where you want to perform the trade. In most of those cases the entire decision making apparatus is colocated with the market it is trading on. In many cases you are in your own cage so IP risk (in terms of accessing the strategy itself by physically accessing servers) is extremely limited.

For research and other non-time critical functions things will either be hosted in-house or more likely at a facility closer to your main base of operations (mainly to facilitate ease of access). Usually there isn't a tremendous amount of gain in running your own datacenter for these sorts of things.

I guess the TL;DR is - for time sensitive trading, colocation; anything else can be done anywhere else, subject to the whims of the firm"

2017-08-15 17:46:03,"Most prop colocate or near-locate at offsite data centers.

It's not only a matter of speed. Couple other reasons, I am sure there are more:

* hardware management and maintenance costs (e.g. use a third party vendor and lease hardware, usually colocated)
* risk management (reduce/eliminate network hops, avoid trading across the internet)"

Ignoring even colocation, the only thing a datacenter over home would provide is remote hands, security, power redundancy, HVAC redundancy, and almost certainly better telco drop offs (including telco resiliency).

Most of these are DR/resiliency type things, but ultimately the decision is going to be based on the strategy need, and how much you *need* your profits. If you can deal with servers or systems or network connections being down, and not making money or being stuck in positions you can't move because you have no mechanism of submitting the orders than more power to you."

2017-08-15 14:26:30,"Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving problems with at least one of two problems: partial feedback information and ambiguous temporal credit assignment.  

Partial feedback is an issue of when an algorithm makes a choice, it only gets a measurement of how good the outcome is.  There is no information on how well other possible choices would have turned out.  In ML theory, these situations are called bandit problems. 

Temporal credit assignment is figuring out which choices you made along the way ultimately affected the long term outcome. For instance, a novice chess player may not know which move during a chess match was the fatal mistake.  

So in principle RL should be useful for trading over simpler frameworks by the extent these two problems are at play.  For liquid assets, we don't have a partial feedback problem.  We know pretty well what the P or L of any portfolio would be on any day by marking to market.  This also gives us immediate feedback.  Your trading strategy made the biggest mistakes on the days that it could have most greatly improved it's market valued portfolio by making a different choice.

Things get more interested in higher frequency because assets are less liquid at shorter time frames, and counterparties can react to your trading activity to give you slightly worse fill prices. These details matter much more when the expected return on a transaction is small."

I'm building a website so people can subscribe to follow the buy/sell signals on a given strategy. Understanding the idea behind the model is paramount, since not all models will outperform all the time. But it's more likely for one to stick to it and endure down moments if one understand the rationale for the model. 

Just some ideas on what I have developed.  The goal is to have a trading portfolio made of models that are driven by different factors, with low correlation between them. I got models for both US and Canada exchanges. Model live performance and simulation includes costs for commissions (1 cent per share, which is what Interactive Brokers charges me) and variable slippage according to the stock liquidity, which is what affect real life performance. A backtest done with these conditions are more realistic to what we might encounter in out-of-sample.

For example, one model is focused in income, by seeking quality companies with low volatility.  This research paper has the details behind to why it works: https://www.researchaffiliates.com/documents/True%20Grit_The%20Durable%20Low%20Volatility%20Effect%20pdf.pdf

This model makes use of market timing based on economic factors, to switch to other asset classes during times that equities underperform, such as in recessions. 

Another model is based on growth, exploring inefficiencies from Nasdaq companies, which are the great for growth as they drive innovation and are strategic for mature companies to continue to be competitive. This model relies on both fundamentals and technical analysis, to take advantage of price momentum (and therefore, overvaluation), which wouldn't be possible to capture with a value approach focused on fundamentals only.  The technical analysis uses the principal of this book: https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Money-Stocks-Winning/dp/0071373616

Given the technical analysis in place, this model also makes use of market timing based on economic factors to switch to other asset types during recessions or crisis.  

Another model is focused on momentum of fundamentals, basically exploring the inefficiencies of small cap companies with decent fundamentals but with price disconnected from that quality, which are also increasing the rate of which fundamentals keep getting better (while stock price doesn't keep up with the same pace).  This is based on this research paper:   https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538867

This paper also explains the benefits when combining value, size and momentum, as per this paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1720139

The model also makes use of these criteria regarding quality: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2287202 


This model does not make any use of market timing - it either buys if there's momentum or sell and keep in cash if the criteria are not met. 

I've also implemented a model trading inverse volatility, as per descritpion and formulas of this paper: http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=19158

The model looks good thanks for the leverage on inverse volaility when in contango model, and it makes use of other leveraged ETFs when not in XIV. The strategy is a variation of #3 described here: http://www.naaim.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00R_Easy-Volatility-Investing-+-Abstract-Tony-Cooper.pdf

So far, using the approach of tagging along well researched papers or books and putting the automation in place to do the hard work for us has been fruitful to complement a portfolio meant for short term gains (these ones, amongst others) and long term gains (investing portfolio made of companies with history of increasing dividends, so I can live off their dividends perpetually and remain invested at all times). 

Trading is much harder than investing because it requires 2 luxuries not needed when investing: locking profits in the short term and reducing drawdown. For this reason, develop a model based on a sound idea, not just performance from a backtest. 

The hardest skill is temperament. It's hard to stick to an idea when a bunch of trades keeping closing at a loss. It's hard to not question the model and to stay away from modifying it on the fly. That's where algo thrives; If you come up with a good model and decide to use real money, stick to it for at least 1 year. Algo trading is mechanical, so there will be losses. Maybe a bunch in a row. It doesn't mean it's broken and no longer works. If one can remember this everytime a trade is closed for a loss, algo trading can be very profitable even with a simple model. "

2017-08-14 17:56:00,"It does, but only kinda. Sometimes I get the feeling people grossly overestimate the capabilities of AI on the market today. Most quant strategies are based around statistical arbitrage or some neural net that's just a glorified probability distribution with weighted modules. It's sad to think that the average joe is so woefully uninformed on this topic that they think that these robots will be able to function indefinitely without modulation or human guidance. Even once AI gets implemented in a widespread scale, there's still a limited amount of resources to be used for automation-style tasks and a runtime for how long these machines will work with service. Much like a car, even the black boxes have a limited life cycle and paying that premium for server real estate by the stock market is going to be a substantial revenue for nearby server farms. Most of the black boxes (public ones anyways) don't give exceptional returns. The only one that I can think of that does is the medallion fund, and even then I'm sure the employees at renaissance do supplement automated decisions with rational thought.      
      
This is still an emerging field and not all of the kinks are worked out. Managers without the ability to code will get weeded out, but what else is new- that's classic structural unemployment. You also have doomsaying attention whores like Muskyboi claiming an AI takeover is a reasonable threat! Joe Public doesn't know, he's just worried because everyone's telling him he's about to lose his job. Worry and panic spread faster than comforting news. Personally, I'm glad to have robots looking for good deals so that I have time to run my own analysis rather than watching candlesticks for a good opportunity. "

You can take all the school you want, advanced mathmatics, statistics, PhD level stuff, Computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, macro and micro economics, ect and you still can never have a working algo. In fact I think it might make some people less successful because the education only trains them to think inside a box.  
  
The research papers you need to find a market edge are already out there, and usually the people who wrote them aren't the ones making money. So if you want to make money and not write research papers then you need to just get hands on experience writing algorithms for profit. Some of the most advanced algorithms I've seen are also some of the least profitable. 90% of the success comes from execution and risk management, only 10% comes from all the fancy stuff people learn in school.   
  
K.I.S.S. principles apply here. Just go on quantopian and find an algorithm that you think is profitable, live trade it. Realize it's not profitable at all. Learn why and try and make it better. After a year of that you will be writing good stuff, then you can try and get fancy."

The divergence began at 14:10 and ended at 14:40.  The IWM low for the day was at 14:30:52.  During that same period, the SPY and MDY, no major divergences.

Was actually looking to draw two different VWAPs based on trade size.  Smart and dumb money? Figured daytraders would trade up to $100K.  I did a COUNTIF for each size trade in 100 share increments, up to 2000 shares. Charted that with linear regression.  With IWM, the drop offs were after 500 shares and 1000 shares.  The 1000 shares were worth about $115K.  It would have only taken another step or two to calculate the number of shares traded above and below 1000, and calculate percentage.  All this is based on trades those below 1000 shares are daytraders.  (Just an idea I came up last week)  

Actually, probably nobody daytrades IWM.  They are more likely to daytrade TNA and TZA. "

I'm not sure how a gradient would be defined in this case as the variables are not continuous nor have any inherent order. I did a test using brute force and as long as I don't have billions of combinations that will work. After that I think I would go with a GA.  "

2014-11-17 10:52:14,"That's correct, you would get N weights. But you would divide the lots proportionally to weights and that would make you ignore small insignificant weights, thus picking less than N stocks.

Here's an example: N=3, k=3 and the optimal weights are 0.5, 0.2 and 0.013. Your allocations will be 2, 1 and 0 accordingly.

The formula for allocation is (what I referred to as ""discretization"" in above post):
allocation to i = rounded(k * coefficient of i / sum of all coefficients)

(then distribute remainder to the allocations with highest coefficients)

Yes, you are right about the solution being for continuous values and your problem is discrete. But the optima in both cases are very close to each other. If you really want to push it further, then you could take this solution and do a search in its neighborhood, just in case the solution is a couple of bits away from the optima, due to inaccurate discretization process)."

2014-11-16 19:39:15,"75 million combinations is small potatoes these days. It can be done in a few seconds with any typical computer at home.

But I think this is a typical portfolio optimization task and there might be analytical (i.e. solving a bunch of equations) solution to this. Basically, you would have N randomly distributed variables and a covariance matrix (NxN) telling you how they are correlated with each other.

Then you need a goal for optimization. If your goal is simply to get the highest mean return then you would take the stock with the highest expected return and allocate all k lots to it. But this is not the case and you would probably want to minimize risk instead.

One popular measure of risk is Sharpe ratio, which is basically expected return divided by standard deviation of that return (the bigger Sharpe ratio - the better). Since standard deviation is square root of variance, the the formula can be rewritten as expected return divided by the square root of its variance.

Once you have expected returns and their variances of each individual N stocks and their covariance matrix (NxN), you can use the following formula to calculate portfolio variance (for multiple variables) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Weighted_sum_of_variables and use another simple formula to calculate portfolio expected return. (here's some related tutorial if you're interested http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWTGzBjjpZA )

Once you've got the complete formula (portfolio expected return divided by square root of portfolio variance), you can derive partial derivatives with respect to each of the coefficients (that would be N partial derivatives). To find the optima you can either solve a system of N equations (each partial derivative equated to zero) or use gradient descent (no guarantee to find global optima if the system is non-convex - not sure about this here).

When you get a set of optimal weights (coefficients), you can then discretize them into integers that sum to k. E.g.
you got weights 2, 1 and 0.33 and k=10, then you would discretize them into allocations of 6, 3 and 1. (of course, in reality it will not be so clean).

Or you could disregard all of the above and do a heuristic search with simulated annealing. There is no guarantee that you will find the global optima, but it's likely to be close to it (especially if you run it many times with different random initializations). The vast majority of the allocation combinations are definitely far from optimal and you could cut your search time with this procedure (no need to check every possible combination)."

2014-11-15 16:49:39,"Depends on what kind of patterns you're looking for and what kind of data. Does the data have seasonalites/cycles/trends? One way would be to apply the empirical mode decomposition technique to your data. Easiest way would be to use the R package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EMD/index.html.

A better way would be to do a frequency domain analysis of your data, and then construct real-time pass-band filters that that extract the patterns of interest in your data. You can do this via the direct filter approach (see Wildi's blog for more info and R code/examples http://blog.zhaw.ch/sef/). 

Do yourself a favor though and forget any time-domain approaches to learning patterns in intraday financial data (via machine-learning, neural networks, etc.) They might sound sexy and sophisticated, but they're an overfitting nightmare and they don't work (for intraday financial data that is).  "

"
2014-11-11 01:06:38,"That's an inefficient way of doing it for hundreds of backtests. If I want to go back to a test I did with certain parameters, I could easily go to the folder and see a complete log of the results. You can't do that if you override the files every time. 

There have also been times where I think certain parameters work better than others, but then figure out a week later that it wasn't true. For example, let's say I did a test where it had an 83% prediction accuracy for 352 trades in the span of 5 years from a list of 200 stocks with an average annual return of 32%. Let's say I run the same test again using different parameters, and I get 92% prediction accuracy for 210 trades in a span of 5 years from a list of 200 stocks with an average annual return of 15%. I might look at it at first and say that these parameters are better because of the increase in accuracy. However, I may look back on it later and realize that it was worse because of the decrease in annual return. 

Now if you didn't keep the results of the first test, you may try to remember it incorrectly. You may have gone with the second test's parameters because you can't say that the first one worked better if you can't even remember it clearly. 

This was just a hypothetical example, but I'd still keep track of all results in separate folders. Even if it hasn't happened to you yet, it could still happen later when you're dealing with a cluster of data, parameters, and multiple versions of different scripts that you have to manage. "
2014-11-11 00:49:28,"The very interesting part in your comment is the words such as ARMA, GARCH, which sounds quite high class than a simple moving average crossing or RSI over buy/sell. Could you give some basic points on what are the fantastic technical to use to predict Forex? But I guess they require too much mathematical background which can't be handled by average Joe?
"
2014-11-11 00:39:26,"Why do you need a folder for each backtest? My system overrides the old result files with the new one. I don't think we need to keep the old ones. If I need to test new parameters, I just change the parameters in config file (not the code), run the backtest, and if I regret and think the old parameters are better, I just change them back and run the backtest again.  
Of course this depends on the performance of backtest. My system can backtest 28 major Forex pairs, which since 2010, H1 data, in several seconds.  
The optimization is a little slow so I store the optimization result and walk forward result on SVN. I don't keep backtest result on SVN. I just do backtest whenever I need the result.  
  
I hate throwing away code too. So when I need to delete any code files, I just move them to a folder named ""museum"".
"
2014-11-10 20:57:31,"I would argue against your second criterion there. There are many processes which can be used for forecasting that have a rough lyapunov time, and thus can't be scaled up. ARMA and GARCH processes for example, which divulge from being chaotic to being random quite quickly, would not be usable if you scaled up a daily trader to look at monthly bars."
2014-11-10 10:45:49,"I'm in the same situation. I have many strategies that I have to keep track of. I'm at the point where I do document every backtest I run, like typing up the test parameters in text files. I also have the script create a new folder, output the backtest results to a csv (all transactions, account balance history, etc.), and copy the code files just incase I want to look at it later. I don't want there to be a situation where I didn't write down a parameter because I didn't think I would ever change it. The script will do this after every backtest. So there's probably about 100 of these folders for every strategy I have. And for any strategy that shows it has potential, there's several hundred of these folders. 

But it's getting to the point where I have a ton of text files that I've written strategy results and parameters to that I can't easily keep track of. I also have about 40 gigs in backtesting results that I've accumulated over the past year.

I also don't abandon any strategies for the exact same reason as you. There have been times where I have gone back to strategies that didn't work at all because I've had new ideas for it. Plus, I hate throwing away code. My mind is more at ease if I just copy it to a folder of old code.

I guess my point is, have your program keep track for you. "

2014-11-09 22:57:49,"In my experience in building automated trading strategies, one aspect that stands out much more that others is how robust it is against three main things: 1) How sensitive it the strategy to spreads and commissions? 2) Is the strategy translation and scale invariant? and 3) How many parameters are you using to ""optimize"" your strategy? 

I can tell you from many years experience that these three tests are the only things that matter. One note on point 2), a solid and robust strategy should definitely be scale and translation invariant. Namely, you should be able to shrink or expand the bars you're working on (from say 1 hour to 4 hours, or 1 hours to 15 min) and get the same results, modulus some constant dependent number of trades during period. You should also be able to slide the strategy x amount of minutes/hours and get nearly the same results (translation invariant).  

For point 3), this is the common pitfall for optimistic (yet naive) automated trading debutantes . If you're looking at historical data at all, and optimizing some constraint/parameter, you're curve-fitting, and this will (obviously) introduce a bias. I don't know what your strategy does, or what you're using it on, but take a hard look at these three points, and you'll save a lot of time (and heartache) in the future. Let me know if you have any questions, happy coding    "
2014-11-09 10:01:08,"/#3...yes, drop those ones that don't work. They are done. To be successful you probably only need one or two that work, not 70 that  don't. I can come up with a million strategies that don't work, what's the point though. Having only a couple strategies solves your overall issue as well. Reading the code isn't a bad solution then as it forces you to review that things work the way you think they do."
2014-11-08 18:24:58,"Isn't it just a question of using enough data from enough of a variety of sources?  Cross-validation leaving out various sources and time periods should give a fairly reliable indication of over-fitting, no?"
2014-11-08 18:03:11,"You would need to cross validate across time, as the data is not stationary with respect to time.

What the authors are essentially saying is fitting rules then applying them to the same data set is not a smart idea. Even if you were to do the same fit creating folds from the sample, from my experience you would still end up with poor OOS performance as the relationships found in the IS data may not be present in the OOS data."

&gt;__Walk forward optimization__ is a method used in [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance) for determining the best parameters to use in a [trading strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_strategy). The trading strategy is optimized with in sample data for a time window in a data series. The remainder of the data are reserved for [out of sample testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_sample_testing). A small portion of the reserved data following the in sample data is tested with the results recorded. The in sample time window is shifted forward by the period covered by the out of sample test, and the process repeated. At the end, all of the recorded results are used to assess the trading strategy.

Got bored and had the opportunity to do this.  but I've still had to learn python, pandas, stats and all the machine learning stuff I can find. as well as R, matlab and research literally hundreds of other things. This is where the 2 years has come from. I saw the rat thing a while back. The results are hardly encouraging.. I thought..  barely above 50% and no confidence in those figures.

I'm not sure what you've done but I'd be very surprised if a single strategy can make money across a diverse range of stocks. Thats why I've gone down the ML route. I figured it was the only way to get something that adapts to the characteristics of each stock. I hand coded strategies that made money, just none that worked without human tuning to each stock. And that's all a bit hand-wavey for real life stuff.. Plus we have subconscious biasses that ruin the results. (we pick good stocks) 

I want to spread my risk across 50-100 stocks to reduce the danger from overnight gaps. (Such is the risk with taking this longer term approach.) Having human tuning for 100 stocks is out of the question. Plus it is impossible to backtest. I never considered intraday to be profitable when you include all the sideways days. I barely put any effort into minute level strategies for this reason. This is why I asked about scanning for 'hot stocks' - either in a sort of finviz.com approach or by monitoring twitter or stocktwits to find what is most likely to move.. 

In terms of modelling slippage. I found that the actual trade prices I achieved live trading were often significantly worse than I had expected. Although I was more interested in less liquid stocks. I did have some nasty suprises with some big name stocks as well. You should throw some money into getting some real figures if you're focussed on intraday trading. These things aren't so important on the hourly timeframe.

2015-01-13 19:15:28,"You have to add commissions to be sure. As for slippage, why not test the worst case scenario (buy at the ask sell at the bid) to see if it still holds up? Even this is not worst case of you are sucking all the bids at that price. 

I like to do sensitivity analysis on all parameters/assumptions in my model. My goal is to make sure that a parameter does not just cause profits out of luck, and to really hone in on the ones that matter. "
2015-01-13 19:11:08,"To a certain extent, but this can be mostly mitigated by making sure your strategy doesn't ever look at anything past the current point.  A proper backtester can easily fulfill this by sending out event messages on each prior bar interval (or tick if you're using high frequency data) rather than providing all the data at once.  This prevents any possibility in looking ahead.

The other potential bias to look out for is survivorship bias.  That one comes extremely often to people that purchase cheap/free data.  You need to make sure you have all names that existed at each period of time (and not just the ones that have ""survived"").  If this isn't possible, stay away from any strategies that may be susceptible to the bias (including index arbitrage strategies).

One other concern is if you're making large volume trades (especially in small caps), you need to remember that most non-commercial backtesters will not adjust for the market's spread/liquidity change on your trades.  On some illiquid assets, you can actually see prices fly just from a $1000 in purchases.  Of course, you're only working with 10k now, but it's definitely something to keep in mind when scaling up.  If you can't get/write your own backtester in this case, the best thing to do is to make sure you fully understand your strategy, and make sure that the trades aren't a significant amount of any volumes (if you can get a hold of L2/depth data from your broker, the L2/order book volumes can really give you a good indication if you're at risk)."

2015-01-13 18:00:32,I think the way to test for this bias is to paper trade the strategy. Is there another way?
2015-01-13 17:58:48,"I have tested this with a bunch of stocks, but it works best with high dollar, very liquid stocks like GOOG, AAPL, PFE. I don't trade dividend and earnings days. I think commissions and slippage should not hurt much with this profile of stocks.

How are you supposed to model slippage? Because it is strict intraday (no holding overnight) on minutes to hours, I modeled slippage using 0.5 * bid/ask spread at the time of execution according to this: https://www.quantopian.com/posts/custom-slippage-modeling-transaction-costs-for-algorithmic-strategies

I use minute instead of hour/daily data to create a greater number of occurrences and avoid the volatility of overnight holding. Sure there are greater transaction costs, but the strategy still holds up in backtesting.

To answer your questions: Sideways days hurt, but it seems to catch enough intraday trends a majority of weeks to end in profit. This is something I'll need to carefully monitor during paper trading. Accounting and look forward bias should also be taken care of with paper trading.

I haven't tried a screener approach or machine learning approach as my linear algebra abilities are probably not sophisticated enough. I come more from a poker, blackjack, and programming background so my edge is not from a superior understanding of machine learning or advanced statistics. My trading approach is definitely unconventional, but that's what you probably would expect from someone who finds edge in casino games that should be unbeatable.

2015-01-13 16:32:50,"commissions and slippage spring to mind, also overnight gaps, or do you never hold overnight? I'd want to run it on as many stocks as possible and I'd want to get some japanese or similarly bearish data to test it on.

Other than that I've got to say I'm very curious what your approach has been. I've read a ton of books and I've self taught a load of stats and machine learning and I still feel nowhere near finding something usable. Despite spending about 12 hours a day on average on trying different approaches. Thats 12 hours a day for coming up for 2 years just on the machine learning approach.

Although my current approach is based on hourly bars instead of what I would guess would be your minute data or tick data.

But I avoided minute or tick data because I believed that at that level you would be all noise and no signal. Just a chop fest on most days.

In fact I'd say that an awful lot of days (even for an index like the sp500) would not justify 10 trades. Back when I looked at the index in close detail I recall the majority of days being so devoid of activity that there wouldnt be 10 profitable trades available. 

Are you targetting different stocks on different days via some kind of screener approach? To pick the 'hot stock' of the day?

The other thing I'd recommend is to make absolutely certain that your accounting is correct. A small mistake with the trade balances can cause chaos with the bottom line.

Assuming you day trade $10k with a $10 stock (1000 shares), you lose $5/trade in commission, and if the spread is something like 10.01/9.99 you lose another ~10$ (market vs. midpoint), so about -$15 every single trade.  If you trade four times an hour, 26 trades/day, that's -$390/day or -3.9% of your entire portfolio every day that you would have to make up.  It seems absurd.

2015-01-11 18:26:46,"Tkinter is a GUI framework, not really for charting. 

pyqtgraph is light years better than matplotlib. 

For starters, it's based atop of PyQt / Qt, so you can just install pyqtgraph and build out Qt based GUI apps... but the key thing is that matplotlib was never designed to do realtime charting. People have made it update on live data through looping, but each update takes a lot of system resources (it's actually rendering then exporting to an image format each frame) and when you integrate the chart into a GUI app it's really a struggle to get the event handler for the GUI interface and the chart update loop to play nice together.

pyqtgraph on the other hand was written for real-time signal processing from the start, has hardware accelerated rendering for 2D AND 3D plots.

Install pyqtgraph, import pyqtgraph.examples, pyqtgraph.examples.run()
(This will do a much better job explaining how awesome it is than my words alone.)

Here's the kicker, watch your system resources (CPU mostly) while running through examples... compare this to doing the same work with matplotlib.

2015-01-11 18:02:57,"I agree, one of the best selling points of python is the incredible amount of library coverage. Anything at all remotely complex likely has an available library to simplify anything you need to write. 

In regards to real-time charting, I was actually looking for something as an alternative to matplotlib which would allow a degree of interaction to the charts I was making. I tried out Tkinter for a bit but it just seems so overly complex for the tasks I'm looking to do. 

I hadn't come across pyqtgraph when I looked around; how is that compared to programming with Tkinter or matplotlib? Obviously more extensible than the latter, but is it on par with the ease of use?"
2015-01-11 17:53:21,"Unfortunately the applications I'm using the matrices for are already a translation from a higher mathematical function, so there isn't really any simplification I can make (that I'm able to do at my level of mathematics, at any rate). 

The method you're suggesting does look like it would be helpful in some situations, though I'm curious: why use that rather than default dicts? Unless I'm misunderstanding, it would do the same thing with the proper construction function e.g.

    from collections import defaultdict as dd
    
    def recursiveDict():
      return dd(lambda: recursiveDict())
    
    foo = recursiveDict()
    
    foo['abc']['def'] == {} # True

2015-01-11 14:52:11,"&gt; Python is fast 'enough' for me if I'm not endlessly piling matrix on matrix, but when I am I've had to wait days for the program to fully execute, even when running in parallel.

When faced with such problems (lists of lists of lists within lists with a list wrapped around it all for good measure,) even though it's common to hear people suggest using numpy arrays or the like to speed this kinda thing up, I've had a lot of success just redesigning how I store and recall the data contained within said matrices and convert the whole thing into a hash table of hash tables.

I'd have jobs that would take hours become jobs that run in a minute or two by doing this. 

Of course, there's some applications where this doesn't make sense, like when you need to run calcs on a 2d or 3d set of numbers, but in a lot of other instances it can help speed things up quite a bit. 

One tool I use a lot now is a pythonic way to mimic pearl's autovivification:

            try:

                value = self[item] = type(self)()

"
2015-01-11 14:43:07,"Seriously.. every time I think I need a feature that Python probably won't do well, there's a well documented and supported library just waiting to be used. 

When I hit the limit of Tkinter, PyQt not only did what I wanted but was easier to use. 

When matplotlib proved to be horrible for real-time charting (which everyone and their dog uses in online tutorials for graphing finanical data).. pyqtgraph not only handled real-time data, but looked better, and didn't bog down the CPU like matplotlib.

Need to obtain specific info from a public site on a regular basis in two projects (example, one that would pull up contextual info about a stock that hits a watchlist, since I'd need to quickly know if the stock is in play and what industry it's in before just jumping in on a volume and volatility filter,)... beautifulsoup was there for me.

I needed to queue up requests sent through my trading platform at work so running multiple algos didn't create communication conflicts, while at the same time decentralize order processing from trade signals and price analysis on my network, and ZeroMQ came in and simplified socket/network programming and let me focus on the task at hand instead of messing with sockets. (I had previously written a few socket level networking apps in Python and even though I got it working, it was a huge pain in the ass just to do something that should have been simple.)

A bonus of the ZeroMQ mention above, even if you're just using ZMQ for IPC on the same host, by using ZMQ you can break the limitations of the GIL and get true multi-prcessing. Sure this is sill possible with the built-in library, but using ZMQ forces you to think about resource and data payload between threads from the start. No worries about pickling objects, etc...

When I was merging and matching off millions of rows of data (18+million) and writing for loops over iterations til my eyes bled was a bit too much, Pandas stepped in and did the heavy lifting for me.

When said 18+ million rows of data needed a home, outputting to MySQL was a snap-in, both within Pandas and directly thorough Oracle's mysql.connector engine.

So many more examples... I've written multiple trading algos.. a reddit bot... an IRC bot... all in python.. 

Here's the best part: I've never gone to school for programming, computer science, engineering, etc... no formal education in any of this. I have a bit of an IT background, but my everything python wise was self learned. That's the best feature of all; well documented libraries with a huge user base, I learned Python through online resources, examples, and time... 

-----------------------

People say Python is too slow, but I only have two things to say about it: 

1) I'm not working on the nano-second level here.. I'm not an HFT firm. I'm very happy working in the millisecond space.

2) Any operation that's too slow just needs to be approached differently. The worst case is you're binding it to a function written in C to do that specific step faster, but I consider this an extreme. I'd happily deal with such things for the other 99% of the time I'm saving time by using Python over fighting with C..."

This is so true! I've spent countless of hours developing (I'm a software engineer) trading algorithms and proprietary indicators, but if you _really_ want to understand the market (and not are looking for arbitrage or other kind of HFT activity), I believe there is nothing like putting on a trade (using your own real money), feeling the emotions and then learn to observe the feelings but not be swayed by them - now you what everyone else feels like and why they take the wrong side of the bet at the exhaustion points. I might add to this that I've also found switching trading between fx 5 minute trading and stock market indices on daily charts (not intraday), most educational.

On that note, I remember this professional poker player saying that the most important thing is to play against people that are worse player then you are. Some instruments that I've traded are prone to whipsawing, but they all have kind of their own ""fingerprint"". I trade the easiest ones I can find. I've also created some computer programs for back testing and implemented my own genetic algorithm. I've never been satisfied with the results, maybe because genetic algos lends themselves to curve-fitting? Anyway, my manual trading is better so I do that. 

In my own trading I do use a semi-automated trading tool that I've developed, to size my positions (basically calc risk to my account) and then I use my own eyes and brain to do a multi-time-frame analysis, where I filter out high probability trades. My trading tool also dynamically adjusts entry/exit levels, order management. Nothing I couldn't do myself, but it saves me time having the program do it.

2015-01-09 11:21:45,"excel is multithreaded;  vba is not.  if your market changes, order fills, etc. are fed into excel cells via dde or rtd, then they're handled just as efficiently as if you'd threaded your own (minus excel or windows overhead).  your trading logic won't be threaded.

2015-01-09 11:09:53,"I really couldn't understand a system that doesn't use multiple threads as you need to listen for confirmations, market data while concurrently calculating indicators/trading logic and real time risk / reporting.

I'ts not all about ""speed"" but more about scalability as the number of instruments increases the number of items to be calculated goes up and the more asynchronous events (more data/confirmations/trades etc). 

"
2015-01-09 11:02:09,i understand what multi-threading is.  i don't believe most diy trading solutions need it.  people spend way too much time thinking about speed when the difference you're realizing isn't competitive anyway.
2015-01-09 10:56:17,"The multithreading is what allows your program to do multiple tasks and not ""linear execution"" (here is my idiot's example of it, hopefully a better programmer can correct me).


**Linear System**

* Data is received
* Data is logged
* Indicators/Signals/rules are calculated
* Orders are placed
* Confirmations received
* Evaluate next point of data

**Non Linear System**

* Data is received
* Data is logged and  Indicators/Signals/rules are calculated
* Orders are placed and new ticks are being receive and Confirmations received

2015-01-09 05:42:19,"Native C++.

To expose C++ to C#, you have two options:

1. Use Managed C++. I don't recommend this. Managed C++ is kind of quirky, not many people use it (so less articles, questions on StackExchange, etc), and most importantly it's not portable to other platforms.
2. Write a wrapper class in C# that uses PInvoke to call C functions. This method is portable to other platforms. The biggest downside to this method is that it only works with plain old C. So, if you want to wrap a C++ class you need to also create C wrapper functions for the class to glue the two together.

I've used both methods in the past. Once you get the quirks down, it's fairly straight-forward. But either method is quite tedious if you have a lot of code and do it manually.

These days, perhaps the best option is to use a code-generation utility to automate wrapping the C/C++ stuff. The most popular one I'm aware of is SWIG:

[http://www.swig.org/](http://www.swig.org/)

I recently worked on a project where we used this, and it seemed to work well. Another guy handled that stuff though, so I don't have any personal experience with it. But it seemed to take him a lot less time than it would've to wrap the code manually."

I use mostly the numpy and pandas libraries, with the occasional python extension or numba gpu routine where necessary, and it is very, very close to C speed. In fact, if you're having these problems with python, then there's a good chance that these tools will produce C code that is faster than what you would have written.

If at 9:25am this morning I had sent a MOO order for 100sh of FB, at 09:30 when the stock was opened by NASDAQ I would have received the opening price of 82.71. 

Remember, in that scenario, mine and all of the other MOO orders are being used to determine the price. This isn't an arbitrary price - it's being set by the auction."

From the NYSE link:

&gt;  At 9:30 a.m. ET, the Market Order Auction will execute at a single price and all unexecuted orders will be released into the Core Trading Session

So basically the open given is that price, and then all MOO orders are subsequently executed in the core trading? Or are the MOO orders executed in the price discovery auction phase?

I'm trying to get an understanding of what price I should expect an MOO order to be executed at, in relation to the open price I have for historical data. I obviously can't know, but I want get some kind of slippage estimate."

I should note that there isn't really an ""opening bid/ask"", just an opening price. The price is determined through the auction process detailed in those links. Time doesn't matter - as long as you make it in before 9:28am EST.

This is all for standard MOO orders, on which you do not specify a price - you are willing to take whatever price is decided."
2015-03-26 10:43:18,"With automated trading systems we always place dynamic stops as soon as a position is entered. Reasons for this:
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
* In case of hardware failure, technical failure - we know our position is protected and risk is quantified.  
* For the average retail investor you do not have to worry about brokers sniping your stops. However, there are algo's which actively hunt out predictable stop levels and use these levels to exploit liquidity.

Moreover, the best thing to do if your are algorithmic trading is to have stops which adjust to market price. Personally i have never found any real advantage to static stops unless the strategy was extremely short term i.e. less than 1 minute holding time.

There's literally only one off the top of my head that truly treats developers as top priority, and that's Two Sigma.  It's also probably one of the most competitive companies to work for in the world though.  They even require their quants to take programming assessments (from what I've heard) prior to joining.

Prop shops that are working with HFT can very often put developers high on the list as well though since they need the developer's expertise in the micro-structure to actually be successful.  But this might not be what you're looking for since the developers can be the ""quants"" themselves.

If you're just a programmer, you are a cost center, not a profit center. Don't ever go work where you work in a cost center division: you automatically become a second-class citizen, and it tends to be almost impossible to move up. Aside from the stigma inside the company, definite promotions tend to be far rarer and harder to get in cost centers.

It could be that hedge funds like Jane Street (who seems to have a real clue, because OCaml) handle this better than large banks, but I doubt it. If you're interested in software, go work for a software company. It'll take some effort to find one where you do work more interesting than just building endless CRUD web and mobile applications, but it is possible.

2015-03-24 03:05:13,"Many of the big names actually choose to hire pure techies when it comes to development.  Prop shops and hedge funds like Jane Street and Two Sigma hire many CS guys from Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  They can absolutely be paid high sums.  $400k+ is a bit tougher for pure, non-quant developers though.  $150-300k isn't too hard if you're hard working and in the field for a couple years.  If you're looking pure development, it's not unusual for prop shops to pay $130kish base with equal or more bonus equaling out to around the $200-300k range after bonus with just two year's experience.

Generally, the closer you work to the money, the more you get.  If you're really looking for the money, some pure HFT prop shops can definitely bring developers into the $400k range.  I'm going to have to say though, that HFT has become insanely competitive, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to make serious money without being extra creative and expanding though.  To make it even more difficult, these same shops generally look for ""hybrids"" that know development down the the bare core (kernel tuning, zero-copy networking, market micro-structure/regulations, basic math/data manipulation, expert-level C/C++/Java).  Getting by without advanced knowledge of that stuff can still probably net you a good 150-200k though.  It's the market micro-structure expertise with a math background combined with expert-level programming skills that will make you stand out into the 300k+ range.

All-in-all, you're honestly better off doing what you like with people you like - if you're saying you're not interested in the math/algo development, you're probably better off taking the $200kish over trying to amass money doing something you don't like (especially when $200k is enough to survive even in NYC).

In theory, the book is correct. (Which book is this from?) However the theory is based on coin flips. In real life maybe there is a bias towards longer runs, when dealing with currency prices (which are not coin flips). Then again, maybe not. You might consider the different candlestick patterns that describe the price movement. Counting a gap up might be considered different than a non-gapping candle, for example. You can also look at different timeframes. For ticks you should be able to get more than 1849 data points."

&gt; 
&gt; System Overview
&gt; 
&gt; Lean outsourced key infrastructure management to plugins. The most important plugins are:
&gt; 
&gt; Result Processing
&gt; 
&gt; Handle all messages from the algorithmic trading engine. Decide what should be sent, and where the messages should go. The result processing system can send messages to a local GUI, or the web interface.
&gt; Datafeed Sourcing
&gt; 
&gt; Connect and download data required for the algorithmic trading engine. For backtesting this sources files from the disk, for live trading it connects to a stream and generates the data objects.
&gt; Transaction Processing
&gt; 
&gt; Process new order requests; either using the fill models provided by the algorithm, or with an actual brokerage. Send the processed orders back to the algorithm's portfolio to be filled.
&gt; Realtime Event Management
&gt; 
&gt; Generate real time events - such as end of day events. Trigger callbacks to real time event handlers. For backtesting this is mocked-up an works on simulated time.
&gt; Algorithm State Setup
&gt; 
&gt; Configure the algorithm cash, portfolio and data requested. Initialize all state parameters required.

2015-03-18 02:32:54,"I don't understand much of what you're saying. I think we may be assigning different meanings to some terms.

For simplicity, let's assume transaction costs are zero for the moment: If the expected payout = 0 right now that implies that we are unable to predict whether it (the expected payout of this trade) will be biased towards + or - in future. If we were able to predict future expected expected payout, then the expected payout right now would not be = 0.

Under these ideal frictionless conditions, the rational thing to do would be to maintain a position size (positive/negative) w.r.t. a given trade that remains proportional to the expected payout (positive/negative) w.r.t. that given trade.

The effect of introducing transaction costs is that we don't connect position directly to ideal expected payout, but rather we connect them with a string, whose length is proportional to the transaction costs. So the expected payout has some ""play"" with respect to the position we've taken. But it might still drag the position to zero without taking it into negative territory.

EDIT: In other words, there is an ""ideal position"" determined by expected payout under zero transaction fees. This ideal position is surrounded by a ""not worth changing"" region whose radius is proportional to the transaction fees. It is then only rational to change the position if it is currently outside the ""couldn't be bothered"" region, and only minimally such that it is once again inside this region. Of course, in reality the discrete steps we take are just an approximation of this theoretically rational approach. The point is that the transaction costs change the target point to a target ""lazy window"". And the greater the costs, the bigger the window."
2015-03-18 02:12:27,"Having the option to quit early with a masters is comforting when making the decision, but it would frustrate your adviser.  Practically, it probably wouldn't make sense to go into a PhD planning on getting a masters for two reasons.  First, you will have to do some research while taking classes, which is a little like a part time job and which might hurt your grades a little.  Second, you can probably get into a better school for a masters than a PhD.  I mean, top schools are nearly impossible to get into for a PhD, but they happily take large numbers of masters students who pay tuition.  I'd personally rather get a top masters than a free masters from a 2nd-tier school.  It might leave you with student loans, but it would help you get a top job.  And later, it would also help if you decided to continue on and try for a PhD from a top school.

Anyway, my advice to the OP is to go for the PhD.  It will open doors and give you confidence and skill.  When you get old and retire, I suspect you would look back more fondly on your PhD years than you would on any extra money you may or may not have made by not doing the PhD.

I think you're talking about trading fundamentals instead of technical analysis. You can definitely create an algorithm to trade fundamentals or rumors, but that's nearly impossible to backtest. I trade with technical analysis, so it's really easily to calculate an indicator and test it on the past 10 years of history for 400 stocks.

But how can you know that those will hold? Like, it's easy to know when Apple is about to hold a press conference, you buy right before and sell right after and you can easily make a quick buck. But, things like that are irregular. Patterns such as long term increase take time. You can pretty assuredly say that over the next 10 years, Google will increase in value. But, by how much is kind of irrelevant because it's almost always determined by their profits (since they have a stock buy-back program). You cant really assume that their profits will have some massive increase any one year unless you have inside knowledge. The only thing that I can think of that is useful to look at is crude oil and the time of year but even that takes a long time and doesnt allow for a regular monthly profit. "

Otherwise I will need have two parallel systems where I perform all the experimentation on Python then migrate the strategy to the system for actual execution purposes."

1. Don't use any variable you don't know about. Somebody may add randomly choosed technical indicators and expect good performance but unrelated variables would provide noises and cause overfitting

2. Filter out noises before apply any time series. Check wavelet analysis and short time fourier.

3. transform data before you apply it into model. dimension reduction helps you extract underlying informations.
 
4. Use Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm rather than backwardprop. backwardprop is extremely uneffective.

2015-06-12 04:51:17,"Thanks for the feedback. The number of inputs to the NN can be variable, as an example, if I would look for sensitivities in the market involving price, volume, RSI, and MACD, this would equate to the following inputs:

open
high
low
close
volume
RSI value
MACD
MACD Signal

which would equate to 8 inputs.  The number of networks generated from this would be permutations of those combinations, which is where the large amount of networks, rather than thousands of inputs.  "

2015-06-06 12:26:48,"Hey, that's great if Qt works well for you! And it may for many in this sub. I know much of the quant crowd loves Python. But, I don't.

&gt; The Javscript UI you are taking about is QML (which is not Javascript, but can have embedded javascript).

Yes, if you want logic with your controls that's ""basically done in Javascript"". I may be biased, but I don't consider that language suitable for large-scale apps.

&gt; The core QWidgets part of Qt is still alive and kicking.

It's available. In fact, I think I read this past week that the last release of Qt 4.x was released. But alive and kicking? I dunno. When I last looked at it, QWidgets weren't completely integrated to Qt 5.x. I assume they are now. But it also sounded like nobody was actively working on them any more, in terms of further development. Has that changed?

I mean, don't get me wrong. If I had a large project using QWidgets I wouldn't run for the hills and rewrite it unless I had to. But for a new project? Its value seems dubious.

&gt; I am in charge of a scientific simulation and visualization GUI at my job, and it uses PyQt4. We routinely put millions of data points into tables and plots with no speed problems at all.

Again, that's great! But it didn't fit my needs.

My primary line of work is graphics tools and game dev. Qt 4.x had a few major drawbacks for me. Namely, its control painting library didn't properly support scaling transforms. I believe it was also tied to its scrolling window mechanism, which was limited (to shorts or ints...I forget). I suppose you could completely ignore it's drawing framework and use OpenGL or DirectX instead. But there lies another problem. It had its own custom OpenGL integration which, again IIRC, was tied to an older version of GL.

Qt 5 seemed more modern in its architecture. But, it was based on Javascript, and had an awkward mechanism for integrating with a C++ back-end. Further, it was clearly geared towards ""modern"" or ""mobile"" apps. It lacked the docking framework of Qt 4 and many common desktop standard controls. Perhaps some of those issues are addressed, but I doubt it's much more C++/C# friendly than when I looked at it.

So, I maintain, if you're a C++/C# guy I don't think there's a really solid winner in the UI category. Sure, you can make an app with any of them, and deal with that API's quirks. But they're all pretty quirky.

Whats your aversion to working for a company?"
2015-06-04 17:24:07,"i was looking to do it with one other guy and we jsut didnt have the time to build hte infrastructure.  with the longer term holds, you can leverage something like zipline (python) to backtest and implement pretty quickly, and at my hold time, quick execution, from say the moment you get a signal to executing in the market, wasnt that big of an issue. As long as its under a minute or so theres no real difference in performance of the overall strategy.  for that, theres a bunch of open source fix frameworks which plug into every broker on the street.  with HFT, speed to execution is everything, and even slightly sluggish, the trade evaporates infront of you.  just a personal preference, still fascinated from an engineering standpoint HFT, but in terms of actual trading, i prefer to try and stake out winners and losers, versus just momentarily market narrowing."

What made you decide against HFT? Why do you like longer holding periods better?"
2015-06-04 15:47:18,"nothing specific, but theyre the most well funded, so the chances of landing a post-grad gig there are probably a lot higher then going to small smaller tech firm that specializes in it.  But really like i said youre looking for anything thats using solid state machines to make real time decisions based on rapid inputs.  to some extent doing work on parallel system, like the Globus toolkit would also be relevant.  but again, all this at the end of the day youll just be a programmer on an HFT team, the real rewards are in designing the HFT strategies themselves.

2015-06-04 11:04:59,"In statistics jargon, test your time series for autocorrelation. Significant, constant, periodic spikes in volume can show up easily in such analysis.

The goal of a good algorithm (for trade execution anyway) is to make the activity look like white noise. If successful, statistical tests would not provide useful results. Looking at larger time periods though, like a day or a week, you'll see a spike in volume. However, this is often no longer useful and the execution has probably long finished."

&gt; Algorithms are used to fill large orders. Let's say you need to buy 1 million shares of stock. You'll move the market if you attempt to execute all at once, so let's say you send a market order for 1000 shares every 5 minutes. And let's say you turn that into code.

Yes, I know, this is what is called a **trade execution** algorithm (explained in the same page in the link).

&gt; Someone else may **notice** that there are 1000 shares being executed every 5 minutes, on the dot.

So to detect others' algorithms I have to ""notice"" a pattern? How exactly do I do that? Even this simple trade execution algo that buys in regular intervals would be nearly impossible to detect with other players buying and selling simultaneously. And also, it is completely impossible to detect more complicated algos with this method."

This is a very poorly written and predictable algorithm. Someone else may notice that there are 1000 shares being executed every 5 minutes, on the dot. To game such an algorithm, just buy some shares right before that algorithm sends their order. If the stock is thin enough, you'll drive up the price for him and you can sell the shares you just got at higher."

You can have the same price in the spread for different prices in the buxl. And having the buxl lower is obv better for the spread. I just dont know how to think about this quantitatively.

that's exactly what i call gobbledigook. we're talking about something that is useful and measured in the real world not in some kind of hypothetical scenario in 2030 in which network response times are in the microsecond domain.

just to clarify: a lot of bitcoin trading bots and implementations floating around are still using rest interfaces to connect to the bitcoin exchanges. websockets is the defacto low latency solution in the consumer domain. if we're talking about corporate trading bots that have some kind of crazy direct access to the stock exchange network we're talking about a completely different environment that has no comparative interest.

an implementation in c or node.js does not make any practical latency difference for this kind of use case unless you're doing some heavy realtime machine learning or technical analysis"

2015-07-24 08:05:36,I guess it's sensible to compare latency in this case to theoretically possible performance over websockets.

2015-07-23 05:12:28,"Both SIPs are, at the moment (UTP is going through an upgrade; CTA is probably not too far behind), incredibly old pieces of technology (by US equity standards). There is no absolute latency, but where markets can typically ack an order in &lt;100usec through a direct market data feed (and get a BBO update to the SIP in the same time) the SIP may take 500+usec to actually push the BBO update to the street. Then your receipt time is a function of which data enter you reside in relative to that SIP (Mahwah for Tape A/B; Carteret for C)

As for how it works, in the most simple terms if any exchange receives a displayed resting limit order that alters the BBO (or if an aggressive order comes in that executes and causes an update to quantity at the BBO, or wipes the price level out entirely) the exchange sends an ""updated two-sided quote"" to the relevant SIP. The SIP, in turn, does some minor calculations (changes to Limit-Up/Limit-down bands for example), and sends the quote out UQDF (talking purely tape C here, but this is applicable for CTA as well; just a different ""feed"" name). Trades are much more simple. The exchange (and any TRFs on behalf of B2B trades, internalization, or ATSs/Dark Pools) simply push trade information to the SIP, which basically creates a single, contiguous, serialized ""ticker"" tape in the UTDF feed.

The only two books I really recommend to new guys coming into the industry are ""Trading and Exchanges"" and ""After the Trade is Made"". Both cover market infrastructure in a very broad way (though both are, as books tend to be, about 10 years out of date in terms of modern technology). I haven't found a book yet that explains modern infrastructure. In all of the the training/education/mentoring I've done in my shop it's just been ""on the job"" mixed with a very large number of white boarding sessions.

Edit: Limit-Up/Limit-Down example above only applies on trade updates, but the ""general idea"" stands. The SIP provides some level of additional services beyond just publishing the quote updates."
2015-07-23 04:44:12,"Would you have any latency estimates on SIP?

2015-07-22 22:03:05,"Nasdaq is ultimately price, display, time. Non displayed orders will generally rest on the book and will execute after all other liquidity has been exhausted at a price level. This can lead to there being more shares available at a level than an algo would typically predict. So, you need to take into account the probability that there is size, either within the spread, or at price levels you are attempting to execute against.

ITCH is merely going to provide full depth of book for Nasdaq. You can approximate at least available shares at the aggregate BBO by looking at UQ, but you won't get full depth (so if you're going to blow through a price level you don't know what is there at any of the other markets.

UT, as /u/lrm242 mentioned, is going to give you all trades on Tape C, but it has little value in terms of possibility of executing at a venue, because you have that system's latency + latency to get the message *to* the SIP + processing time at the SIP + time to deliver the message to you + your processing time prior to uniquely time stamping the message."

2015-07-22 20:21:29,"Ah, thats a great answer. Thank you.

Is my understanding correct that dark executions shouldn't influence order matching (like quotes from other exchanges might do -&gt; NBBO).

*edit: that was probably a stupid question
"
2015-07-22 20:01:57,"TotalView will give you the full view of the Nasdaq book. Every order, execution, etc. All hidden orders and midpoint executions will also be shown. Hidden executions in TotalView do not show you which side was the aggressor anymore, but other than that you see everything that happens on the Nasdaq book.

UQDF are top of book quotes for all market participants. Since we're talking executions, it doesn't come into play.

UTDF show all trades that happen at all exchanges, ATSs, etc. So, TotalView is showing you a complete view of the Nasdaq book including the trade aggressor for matches that happen against displayed liquidity, whereas UTDF is simply showing you time and sales. UTDF basically tells you time, price, size, and venue for executions market wide. Note, even if you take book feeds from all venues UTDF is still required to see dark executions.

The only way to reliably merge these three feeds is if you have a synchronizing timestamp. The timestamps in the feeds themselves are worthless in terms of knowing which event happened first. So, you need to collect the data yourself and timestamp or merge in real-time or get the data from a vendor that has done something similar."

* We also have a an [active Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zipline)

* Since Quantopian runs on Zipline a lot of the code you write in the Quantopian IDE is directly portable to a Zipline environment. Check out the [Quantopian Docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help). There are some Quantopian specific things like ""set_universe"" but for the most part it translates pretty well.

* As u/EntropicThunder mentioned, we have some tutorials that will likely help. [Actually someone on our forums recently asked for tutorials.](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/simple-tutorial-for-quantopian)

Finally I think the best way to get introduced to Zipline is through [Quantopian Research.](https://www.quantopian.com/research/survey) You get all of the functionalities of Zipline in a curated environment, which is nice because we provide all the pricing and volume data, plus fundamentals. There are definitely more ""Quantopian"" tutorials, but a lot of that knowledge can be transferred over to your own Zipline environment if you wish to go that route."

in these scenarios your network connection's latency far outweighs the few microseconds you save on cpu speed.

The issue/tradeoff is that the more degrees of freedom you allow in the model, the better the fit will be regardless of whether it holds true in the future.

2015-07-21 10:26:10,"Ahh, okie dokie. "
2015-07-21 10:24:29,"No, you're reading the chart wrong. The chart implies the edge is from the announcement date to effective date. As I said, the SP inclusion criteria isn't cut and dry and is extremely subjective. So theres no way to accurately gauge what will be changed without carrying a basket of 5 or so names and now you're subject to market risk.

Anyway, I just checked. All Sp500 names are ETB. Yes, in smaller indexes of more obscure names there is a larger edge in htb names. 

"
2015-07-21 09:19:29,"Well, that chart someone posted seems to imply that there's quite a bit of edge before inclusion, with people taking off their positions after the announcement: http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i9A1RS7RGBe0/v1/-1x-1.png . Do you read it this way as well? 

I don't have a hard-to-borrow list handy, but I wouldn't be surprised if the ones far down on the list with market caps in the single $B required locates. That being said, it's surely the case in other less liquid indices, where, again, there will be more edge. "
2015-07-21 09:01:30,"Meeeeeh, i don't agree with this. We are talking about the SP 500 after all. almost all the companies listed on it are extremely liquid and easy to borrow. Since SP doesn't publish a clear methodology on inclusion criteria and the fact that changes are triggered based on corporate events, I doubt there is much edge to creating a portfolio around it."
2015-07-20 23:51:50,"Loooool. Runs on nodejs. For it to be 'fast' you have to compare it to something, not pull an arbitrary threshold out of a hat and say you beat it. Try reimplementing in C for a start."
2015-07-20 23:25:22,"Why would you suggest CUDA for 'performance'? There are certainly problems which it excels at (e.g. pricing), specifically in regard to research. However, I have yet to hear of a use case for real-time trading. The memory bandwidth issues simply create way too much latency to overcome. 

OP - my answer for you is it depends on your what you're trying to accomplish and also the requirements of your strategy. For example if you're trying to deploy a strategy where microseconds matter, then clearly python nor R would be valid candidate. On the other hand, both could be reasonable for research purposes. "
2015-07-20 23:13:26,"I don't trade equities but I was going to come into post this. The data file only has dates, but no time. Just glancing at the equity curve, my first impression would be that there's lookahead bias in the backtest. "
2015-07-20 12:36:11,"That's just incorrect. See reg t margin regulations for equities. 

I said outside of fx as that's largely unregulated. If you can find a broker who offers 10 to 1 margin on us equities for accounts of 3k I'll be very surprised. Post a link to these magical brokers please.

2015-07-19 22:01:29,"I was wondering if anyone else thought this. The design of the IB Java API seems either very outdated or highly constrained by the functionality of their internal systems. I remember trying to use it and it was very awkward when trying to call it from a more modern language on the JVM.

It was probably written 10+ years ago and they have no reason to overhaul it so I can't blame the devs. Sounds a lot like how we develop software at my current employer.

2015-07-19 14:19:19,"Try opening an account with 3k outside of fx and asking for leverage. I was referring to 30-50k levered 10-20x to actually make serious returns.

Platform, hosting costs and transaction costs will eat away from your equity. If you only have 3k, you have bigger problems  than building an algorithmic trading model.

2015-07-19 13:34:45,"First, a lot of the edge is in figuring out which stocks will be included/dropped before it's announced officially. You'll want to be overall delta neutral as well to protect against general market moves during the period you have the position on by shorting the stocks being dropped (among other things). A lot of those stocks being dropped are going to be smaller, less-liquid stocks (they're being dropped from the index, after all), because of this it can be costly to locate a borrow so that you can short them.

Their business model is bring on as many traders as you can, get them to trade as much as they can till they lose their initial deposit. Firm makes a crap ton of money on the comissions they churn.

quant prop shops: the ones you mentioned JS, SIG, Optiver, DRW etc. These aren't discretionary shops, they only hire quants developers and focus on automated trading for the most part. Lots of market making strategies in a wide variety of markets. salary &amp; bonus generally.

Reputable prop firms: They will back you and absorb your downside for a larger cut of profits (think 50/50 split). Lots of leverage available, firms incentive is to help you make money because their income is from trading profits not commissions. I know that some firms also give you the opportunity to put down capital for a larger split but that is generally for experienced traders who are willing to risk their personal capital to get a higher cut.

2015-07-18 08:09:26,"Our country is the same way. Adding liquidity on most exchanges gives you a rebate. Off the top of my head you'll get around $2 per 1k shares to add liquidity and $3 per 1k to remove.

Docker has it rough parts but the community help and the potential benefits are amazing - this is clearly where the future is, so even if I spend more time it won't be wasted. I like to think of OS as technical details below your own layer of abstraction and like the vision of Docker dealing with it.

There is still IG with its simple and clean API and others like Olanda, I've also seen some 3rd party wrappers around IB like https://github.com/castedo/brokertron-public, using Docker unsurprisingly :)

For now, my main objective is to develop and thoroughly test my trading strategies, which can be done in the code of my preference (PHP as of now but I'm not married to it). Then I will test how much my winning strategies are indeed affected by speed, slippage and spread, and only if the IB will have a measurable edge against IG, there will be compelled business case to invest in their bloated API.

The book specifically spends a lot of time discussing how not to over-fit the curve, and to be sceptical. He shows a few techniques to show how to avoid doing that yourself in your own strategies, and does it on that specific strategy.

He also suggests that you need to constantly review what is going on because suddenly the market can change. All common sense.

Sounds to me like the market adjusted for lots of people running the strategy once he'd published it."

Algo trading does not need to be HFT, and for most people it shouldn't be. 

For one individual or for a smaller team it probably makes more sense to say ""don't go to HFT - make your money elsewhere and build a team with the money you make if you want to get there eventually""."

Did you really have MM experience on the CME and NSE? Because your writing suggests you just know a few analytics tools and haven't actually done MMing.. 

For instance, a MM capturing the spread won't pay the spread on another instrument to hedge out.. and even if they were, your example of EURUSD to EURAUD just creates synthetic AUDUSD exposure.

Atop of that, no exchange compensates MM'ers for their losses just because they provide liquidity. You're bullshitting people on that point. "
2014-09-03 11:04:50,"1) I am not usually a fan of randomly sampling the data to build the training/test/val sets. I am more concerned with how my model is going to perform over the most recent data and less with how it did a random sampling. While this runs the risk of having my data sets reflect only certain market conditions, I believe it is worth the trade off to get an idea of how well the model would have performed recently. This also creates a reproducible process if you were to use it real life. In this post, I use the first 60% as the training set, the next 20% as the test, and the most recent 20% as the validation set.

2) In this case, we just built a static model. Using a sliding window technique, where the data sets are shifted to incorporate the most recent instances, would most likely improve the performance and give you added insight into your model but is beyond the scope of what we did here. Maybe I'll explore that in a later post....

A lot of people think they are going to build a ""SUPER DUPER 1337 HFT HEDGE FUND!!!!1"", when in reality HFT is a technological arms race that requires infrastructure investment in the millions and a lot of expertise.

Getting compensated for taking on time units of market risk is how everyone here is going to make money (taking positions and profiting off market moves in their directions). I would personally say depending on what you're running, the amount of things you need to calculate and the performance requirements of the system will drive language choice/infrastructure choices.

2014-08-29 19:10:42,"I agree with you; except I'm a bit more empathetic to the peeps here as I was once a bright-eyed young person hoping to become rich. Ironically, it was when I worked as a programmer for a high-frequency broker/dealer that I realized how unattainable it was unless you have a team of experts, capital and access to the exchanges. 

At the place I used to work for, for every bullet point you posted, there were about a team of 3-5 people working on that one specific problem. There was a FT programmer just working to patch the smart router with all the new order types introduced and fee structures from all of the exchanges. Another guy whose job it is to fly out to the different data centers in Chicago and Jersey City to deal with installing racks and mapping out what network connection and redundant connection are most optimal. Core trading server guys whose job is to optimize and reduce latency to the N-th level; and that's not to mention the actual traders who are cooking up the strategies, and the developers who are running backtests and forward tests. 

You can even delegate these problems out now by going with sponsored access or HFT brokers like Lightspeed or Lime who will rent out their co-location space in the exchanges and their trading API, so all you have to focus on the strategy. But even then, you still at least a million to start out to churn out enough volume and make it worth your time. 

Rehashing my orig. point, it's like I'm a 5'10'' guy trying to play basketball with Lebron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; instead of that, I need to look for my own niche."

* expert in cpu architecture 
* expert in low level programming languages and parallel programming 
* expert in networking, market microstructure, fix protocol etc

To get to true HFT (essentially scalping and arbitraging), I believe you need two things, 1) co-location to the exchange data centers (BATS, DirectEdge, Nasdaq, NYSE, etc.) and preferably to dark pools (Sigma-X, CrossFinder) and if arbitraging between options/futures, access to fiber networks between CBOE, CME data centers in Chicago to Jersey Center equity exchange data centers, 2) become a broker/dealer entity, a member of the exchanges which entitle you to the liquidity rebate/takermodel (e.g., low commission, trade for a quarter of a penny or less and entitled to $0.20/100 shares for liquidity providing) and a lot of capital to generate the kind of volume where trading for profits and scalping making a quarter of penny per share and do it a couple of million shares per day. 

Most people on this forum, I'd wager do either, 1) momentum trading or mean reversion strategy based on some kind of technical analysis indicators, 2) option spreads, delta-neutral or directional and hedging or scalping with the underlying, 3) forex trading based on some kind of pair trading or basket trading or technical indicators; your typical holding period is not going to be in the order of micro-seconds or milliseconds and probably in the minutes at the minimum waiting for the breakout/breakdown/correlation convergence. Most people are probably going through retail brokers such as IB, Oanda, TDAmeritrade (who doesn't route orders direct to markets sells orders flows for payments). 

Which there is nothing wrong with that, but at least for myself, I concede speed to the players; building my C trading algorithm isn't going to cut it against guys who have co-location, ultra-low fee structure/rebate/margin and capital than I can ever hope to compete with. So I decided to focus on my space, trading where holding periods are longer. Anyways, I want to voice my opinion against the grain and would love to hear others' take on this. "

2014-08-29 03:47:37,"I doubt such a book exists. There's not a lot of one-size-fits-all in the field, some aspects of the design/infrastructure of existing systems are likely considered trade secrets, and I don't think the market for a book like this would be large.

Most importantly, this is just a matter of applied computer science and SW engineering. Forget about the trading angle for now and just read up on algorithms/data structures and (distributed?) system design. Once you've got both the CS and trading/statistics knowledge covered, pick a class of strategies you have the resources to execute and find/design a system tailored for the task.

There's a fair bit of open source out there you should look at, e.g. fix libraries, LMAX' disruptor pattern[[1](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX)][[2](http://yow.eventer.com/yow-2013-1080/disruptor-3-0-details-and-advanced-patterns-by-michael-barker-1381)] and even some complete trading/analytics platforms.

2014-08-23 01:47:03,"I would suggest NinjaTrader over TradeStation or the others, as you can SIM trade for free (with real data), plus it's .NET (C#) based, which is super robust.  The current version is NT7, but they are just about to release NinjaTrader 8, which is a HUGE upgrade over NT7.  

It's a steep curve, man--and long.  Don't expect this to take a year and be profitable.

Also, you MUST understand Risk of Ruin and Risk Management before you start trading.  Please don't just focus on methodology, entries and exits, which are worthless if you are risking too much capital per trade.  

I would recommend Brent Penfold's ""Universal Principles of Successful Trading"" and then Pardo's book on the scientific method as it relates to backtesting.   Kevin Davey just came out with an algo trading book, too--although I haven't read it, but I have read a ton of his stuff on the interwidewebs (i.e., forums).

If you are going to trade futures, I would also suggest that you consider Big Mike's Trading, which I have found to be one of the most solid group of traders out there.

If you don't know what to tell your algorithms to actually do, then the fact that you know how to code will only allow you to wipe out your bank account faster than if you did it manually.

So, yes, if you don't know how to trade, I'd definitely start from there, and automate what you've learned later.

2014-08-22 00:28:24,"Honestly, no.  I did see a speed decrease initially, but the code was less ""hacky"" and easier to follow, so I discounted the speed decrease.  However, once I put Akka in place for my original implementation I saw it jump back to nearly the same levels.

My approach uses genetic algorithms (GA) to come up with solutions, so that's where the majority of my time is spent; during the training and evaluation loop cycles.  I used Guava to create a temporary in-memory cache to avoid re-evaluating the same calculations and then I saw better performance.

Another added bonus was reclaiming my CPU cycles.  The original Java version used a thread pool, but it ate up my CPU like crazy by pegging each core at 100%.  Akka left everything at around 60%.  Overall I'm much more satisfied with Scala than I am with Java.  I trade the M30 or H1 charts, so a slight delay in evaluating (currently sitting at 6 mins without Akka - with Akka I should be able to get it to ~2 mins per pair) is something I can life with."

2014-10-07 12:19:39,"slippage is more the bid/ask spread though.  even in CL, with one contract paying the spread both ways = (10*2) + 5*2  and youre at 30.  if you factor in slippage from desired entry point, to actual execution, you need to be buying at the exact moment your system tells you to (bid/ask is 10/contract in CL)  so if you are even 1 cent off from your entry signal price, your slippage will be higher then 35/round turn.  The point of a backtest is to be overly conservative to mitigate poor actual trading assumptions.  35 is not unreasonable at all, and it gives you the benefit of knowing even with generous slippage assumptions you will still make money.  35 is a CTA industry standard "

2014-10-06 16:29:21,"35 USD/round trip, is that per contract? If so, seems like overkill to me. Although everything depends on the futures contract you're working with (and your broker), in my automated trading system using Interactive Brokers, I buy the bid/ask spread, which costs around around 5-10 USD per contract roundtrip (on NG and CL), and the commission is 5 USD, leading to a max trading cost per rountrip, per contract at 15 USD. There is of course positive slippage which improves this cost around 50% of the time, but 15 USD per contract is very conservative in my system. "

If you can come up with some unique selling point that isn't already being done you might be able to compete with deltix (probably the leader in the space). However support is also key and finding a respected launching client is going to be another challenge.

2014-10-06 00:54:59,"Well I've simplified things quite a bit here, we don't know yet, maybe we can make it free like for a certain dataset and period and other things that are already out there for free, but with paid features like for things that need to use a lot of computing power.

Can't go into detail but it is more complex than just presenting a chart with indicators. I understand there is free stuff out there and that is exactly why some things will probably end up being free, if it doesn't work we will probably license under GPL and be done with it. Maybe we will get better jobs if we do that? :)

We use R but only for research, e.g. when we need to quickly chart something. Wouldn't it be too slow to actually backtest a lot of data with R? 

We are using C++ and Java. I would imagine our clients would be interested in precision, flexibility, ease of use and speed. But I see your point on there being a lot of things already out. So we don't know if it will work.

Any advice would be welcomed.

Basically what we want to do is sell the simulation of the strategy as a web service. Do you know if there is a permit that we as a company need to get to do this legally? We will double check this with a lawyer before committing to it.

2014-09-28 03:15:20,"As most have said here, Java, C++, and C are all very heavily used.  Each have their own applications.  As biased as I am with C/C++ (since I work primarily with extremely low-latency settings where microseconds will affect PnL), Java absolutely has its uses.  In fact, a lot of companies prefer Java over C++.  The performance between the two languages are practically identical (with Java occasionally even faster with some stack operations).  However, there's a few main things that keep people from using Java: C++'s RAII and deterministic memory behavior.  While you can adjust Java's garbage collector/tune it, there's no way to entirely remove it.  This can cause a number of issues with extremely time-sensitive code.

This also becomes an advantage though.  In the case where performance is important, but not absolutely critical, Java maintains the advantage of creating clearer code faster.  While I'm biased towards C++, and I dislike writing Java, there's no arguing that the fact that automating memory management is a life saver when you're short on time and need something out reliably without memory leaks.  Even the best developers in the world will occasionally accidentally leave a few memory leaks (sometimes RAII isn't a viable option).  This in itself can be an issue when tons of data flow through.

Additionally, Java is focused on simplicity.  If you're working with C++11 and all of the new lambda/move semantics/TMP, you're spending time on the small components of an algorithm.  You're using up time on picking up details over thinking through the algorithms holistically.

Because of this, you'll notice that, in fact, most jobs that are not extremely low-latency to be in Java/C#(C# being a mix of Java and C++ but limited to Windows/Mono).  With your background, I would even encourage you to learn Java.  Again, while I do enjoy C++ more, I think it's essential to know programming algorithms/utilizing libraries at the Java level before you start working with compile-time and byte-level optimization.  It's very easy to get caught up with it.

As for Python/R/Matlab - they're not really comparable to C++/Java.  Those are mainly used where performance is less of a necessity.  It can also be used in prototyping and testing code.  It's extremely handy to have a Quant write up some Python/R/Matlab code before the C++ developer writes the rest up (Quants, from experience, tend to write the most sloppy/scary code).

Edit:  Also, if you don't know how cache and memory work, just stick with Java until you do.  There's actually a good chance that you will not only write non-optimal code, but you will also write more confusing code than Java.  Even though it's important in Java, it's not nearly as big of a deal in not knowing about memory in C++ as Java."

None of my automated trading strategies come close to using anything beyond basic high school math.  Most of my strategies are based on market micro structure, that is taking advantage of very specific functions provided by the markets, such as order types, fee structure, special auctions, so on so forth.  The remainder of my strategies involve arbitrage based on market events such as economic indicators, Fed announcements, market imbalances, so on so forth.  But once again they're all very simple.

We do create formal models, but the models are event driven with some probabilities involved, rather than being predominantly driven by sophisticated mathematics.  So our formal models will consist of state machines and we'll evaluate the paths that our state machine can transition to/from as well as what the risk/reward is.

But nothing we do attempts to really predict the price of a stock, at best what we try to do is average out positions over a period of time not exceeding 3-4 hours so that we can make money off of liquidity rebates."
2014-09-26 11:15:11,"If thats the case then there are platforms already built (see: Tradestation for basic strategies) if you want to build your own models, there are frameworks well discussed in this subreddit that tie into interactive brokers (a low cost electronic brokerage) quite nicely.  you'd be responsible for coding and maintaining your signal generation platform in that case, but the hard part of access to data and trade execution would be done for you."
2014-09-26 09:37:11,"I think you are confusing the two aspects of the system.  there is the infrastructure aspect to support research &amp; trading, ie the software to get the data feeds, do the model analysis, output signals, do the trading, book the positions, etc.  This part can either be build yourself (read: long, time consuming) or there are plenty of third party vendors (read: expensive, lack of control).  The entire other aspect is the models themselves which control the signals.  What you're seeing more on Quantopian are the models themselves.  Models can be and are built to trade everything.  The infrastructure aspect facilitates the execution of research, but the hardest part is understanding and building the models themselves.  When discussing out-performance, you really have to think about your models specific family versus benchmarks.  Algo trading is so broad it could be anything from hft market making strategies in currencies or equities, to options price modeling, to trend following long term trading, etc.  so really you have to be more specific as to what kind of algo trading you want to develop.  an infrastructure for example for high frequency equity trading is going to look very different from futures only long term trend following.... if that makes sense."

2014-09-17 03:58:03,"Actually they wont average out, they will generally average out against you.There are three basic ways of executing a trade - Market order, limit order or Market on close (MoC) order. In case of market order you pay bid ask spread plus market impact. Bid ask spreads are easily observable and are around 1bp to 10bp or even more depending on the liquidity. Market impact matters if your trade sizes are big. In general, your market impact is of the order of 10bps if you do 10% of stocks volume over a day gradually and carefully.In case of limit order, you have the problem of adverse selection. Say you see price of a stock as,10.01/10.02 and you place a limit order to buy at 10.01. In this case, if the price moves up (in your favor since you are buying) then your trade is not done and you will have to buy at higher price. But if it goes down, i.e. against you, it,will get done. This,will happen even if your limit is 10.02 in fast markets.In case of moc, again you skew the book one,way or the other depending on whether you are buying or selling and the auction price will again be impacted, but  here the impact is the smallest as a lot of liquidity, around 20% of volume in some cases, is available at the same time and price. For retail, the,impact would be negligible but for large sizes this can be substantial. I have simplified the above quite a bit and the numbers are also just illustrative. As you all know it is all quite complex.  edit: Before someone talks about the fact that if you are losing then the person on otherside is gaining, this overall cost is the pnl of market maker community which runs into billions."

We actually only use intraday bars, but they were coming in so slow from IB while using Python. Now we use CQG which is too expensive, but slightly faster on our platform. We were thinking maybe using C++ could speed up our intraday bar aggregation from IB to reduce costs. We aren't doing HFT or anything, so we really just want to be able to receive a bar and place our order within 1 second. Right now it's taking us 3 seconds on average."
2017-04-21 12:24:03,Exactly.
2017-04-21 12:18:01,"Wow, that's really interesting. So you take market data from C++, feed it to python for analysis, produce a signal in python, and then send back to C++ for order execution?"
2017-04-21 12:14:27,"We actually use both Python and C++ in our platforms. All the market data, order execution, etc. that uses the IB API is done in C++. Python is the language that makes all the decisions and overall drives the strategy. I love the C++ API for reliability more than speed. Our programs are also just run from the command line which reduces computational overhead - not sure how common that is.

I'm not sure what your situation is, but I don't know if switching API languages will drastically speed up your platform. Our bottle neck is waiting for market data - the 50 messages/second limitation is quite annoying. On top of that we have to manage data feeds so we don't break our market data line limitations, which requires more waiting. Point is, if Python is somehow slower than all the waiting you have to do with IBs annoying limitations, then switching to C++ might be a good idea.

I typed this quickly at lunch so if something sounds like gibberish just ask for clarification."

""Machine learning"" is an abstract concept not a process - an implementation or approach to machine learning might be Deep-Learning.  So right off the bat, it clearly shows he has trouble with the very basic concepts he's trying to teach.

There are several more issues, like an entire chapter or section dedicated to setting up python in a container - couldn't that be more easily done by providing a link to the 100s of excellent tutorials on the net that come prepackaged with all kinds of quantitative packages already installed and in continuous update mode - at the end of the day you're teaching and charging for Algotrading with Python and not python basics.

In short: you'd be better off considering alternatives.

a person with a great algo would not be wasting their time commenting on this thread like you've been. they would know more about the markets then you do, and they would understand what they can and can not discuss to protect their intellectual property.

i have extensive plans to walk as minister.

2017-05-31 21:10:42,"Yes, I have seen the Chaudhuri and Lo paper .. I am trying to track down something for you that is a little more focused. They have a lot in there on the math of the Fourier transform which is something we don't really need to read. A couple of comments: (1) You may be better results if you use the difference of the natural logs of the closing prices (which is the math equivalent of the log of the ratio of any two prices). (2) There are a lot of problems with using an FFT to determine the highest frequency in the signal for any number of reasons ... you may get aliasing for example that appears as an actual frequency when in fact it is not (this works the same way as aliasing in music if you are using a sample rate that is too low given your signal). You can easily get gibberish unless you think through what you are doing.

I take it that, from your description of the delta, that you are using daily data with a relatively small sample size (compared to what you would get if you use  2 years worth of second-by-second data). You are only going to capture the longest of wave lengths .. possibly the equivalent of business cycle behavior. Do you have any access to second-by-second to experiment with?

If you had second-by-second then you could set a preliminary window of an arbitrarily long length (like 10 trading days) and experiment with narrowing that down.

I don't know what you mean by ""plotting frequency against time."" The whole point of a Fourier transform is to move interpretation of a periodic signal from the time domain the the frequency domain, That what the transform does. It might be worth your time to instead attempt  a spectral diagram of a certain time period (sort of like a frequency distribution histogram over set time periods like one hour). I remember that there is a crude Quantopian example that perhaps I can find the link for.

But first there is a big question that you have to settle in your mind .. if you are talking about time-series stock data, even if you end up locating a periodic signal, what would it mean? What, for example, would be the interpretation of a decrease in frequency? Would you expect that to be a symptom of a stock that is moving away from mean-reversion behavior? (Possibly)."
2017-05-31 21:10:29,"""Seasonal"" is such a small subset of periodic signals that to use it would be misleading. Seasonal implies a long-term regular periodic signal and that is something that is rare in all except textbook examples of sinusoidal signals. My experience is that financial data is more like music .. abundant with multiple complex short-term signals that shift and move but occasionally repeat themselves, perhaps in detectable and meaningful patterns."

2017-05-31 13:04:02,"&gt; can you expand? if you mean latencies, hardware requirements, delays to the market, etc. it should be more efficient with a bucket broker.

No, it shouldn't. You don't make something more efficient by removing it entirely. If I ask for a beef burger and you bring me a chicken burger because it's faster and less expensive, then shrug and say, ""Well meat is meat right?"", you haven't solved a problem for me or made any of the process more efficient. You've just bypassed it, and in doing so delivered the thing you *think* I want (meat) and not the thing I *actually* want (beef).

If I'm trading securities, whether it's an underlying or a derivative, I want to *own* the security and have some assurance that I'm actually participating in the market. You don't make latency and delays to the market more efficient *by removing the market* - that's incoherent. You've just cleverly substituted what I actually wanted with a poor imitation that doesn't resolve my original pain point. Now I have two problems instead of one.

&gt; price discovery -&gt; should effectively be done by the house if they clone your strategy.

...so to be clear, you are advocating that the broker duplicate your strategy, then arb it out of existence? And this is worth it to you so you can save a relatively small amount of money per trade? This is how you want price discovery to be facilitated in a bucket shop?

&gt; convenience -&gt; I would argue it is beneficial at any level, even for institutions. from user interface to clean access to the market. especially in the finance industry with a notoriously bad IT legacy.

Let me approach this by starting here: I used to sell financial data to hedge funds. We tried to offer a whole bunch of sophisticated tech-savvy things to make the data interesting. At the end of the day, every single one wanted the data analyzed in an Excel spreadsheet so their own teams could review the data and import it into their models internally.

First of all, the financial industry doesn't universally have bad IT. It's not necessarily *polished*, but it often works exceedingly well. You don't sound like you know much about the actual engineering practices available at sophisticated firms. Sure, some banks have software that will make your eyes bleed, but it often works. And moreover, when it doesn't, zero-commission broker software is not going to resolve that particular cruft.

Second of all, do you know why there is so much cruft, where it does appear? Because the polish is meaningless. This not consumer facing software that requires adherence to whatever the JavaScript framework du jour is.

You keep talking about convenience, but firms that actually make money aren't optimizing for convenience. They're optimizing for usability within a framework that prioritizes profitability above all else. It's nice if it's polished, sure. But the user interface is strictly secondary, and when you're receiving a nice user interface in exchange for *giving away intellectual property* and *removing yourself from market participation*, that becomes decidedly inconvenient."

2017-05-31 12:31:32,"Disclaimer: I didn't study in Vienna nor in the Netherlands. I'm a physics student who has spent quite a time in Innsbruck, Vienna. This is my opinion. 

I prefer Austria over the Netherlands as a country. By a lot. I simply love mountains in general, and I really like the Alps. My time in Innsbruck was mostly spent being in the mountains, skiing, climbing, hiking, etc. Now, I know that Vienna is not the same as Innsbruck in terms of mountains, but it's still awesome! 

Next, Vienna is an awesome city, culturally speaking. By no means could any city in the Netherlands keep up with it, still culturally speaking. I mean, simply have a look at the history of Vienna and you know what I'm speaking of.  

Finally, Vienna's universities have quite a high prestige in Europe. They're not the top, but they're definitely higher ranked than universities in the Netherlands, afaik. I know, prestige is not everything, far from that, but ... it helps.

2017-05-31 12:06:46,"&gt; if someone offered to entirely remove the commission and most other restrictions and told me straight up the trades bucketed, why would I care? It is just a much more convenient broker for algo-trading

You'd care because this is a non-problem that is consistently targeted by an industry that (in my opinion) preys on the misunderstanding of unsophisticated investors.

If you are capable of developing a profitable strategy as a retail trader, it is *far* more likely that your greatest impediments are technical and logistical in nature rather than fees. With a few exceptions that are mostly out of the realm of profitable trading for retail investors, any profitable trading strategy you come up with is profitable under the current schema of commissions. Optimizing your choice of broker/platform for commissions is the wrong way to succeed. Obviously it's *important*, but it's really not the greatest determinant of success. You should optimize your choice of broker based on *execution.*

Now let's look at the downsides - if the trades are bucketed, you're working with play money. You do not have transparency as a consumer, you are not aiding in price discovery (which is the primary purpose of the market), and you are relying on the operator of the bucket to be honest despite the lack of transparency.

When trades are bucketed, the operator can wait to execute a trade until it's advantageous to them, and simply pocket the difference between your order price and the execution price. They can also just keep the money and never execute the trade, or take your strategy and replicate it on the real market. This is not an organic way to reduce fees for legitimate traders, it's a mechanism for transferring capital and intellectual property from many parties to one central party.

In other words, you're literally gambling against the house, which is heavily incentivized to be dishonest. It doesn't matter if it's more convenient for you as an algo trader, because optimizing for convenience is the wrong thing to be doing. You're not in this because it's easy and has a low barrier to entry."

Yes.

&gt; hence, for orders, it is more beneficial to stay instead of leaving, or? 

No...I don't follow. The issue of size affecting the market will follow them to whatever platform or broker they choose to work with. But at least if they have working trading algorithms they are capped by only their own capacity (theoretically), instead of exposing it to another platform that will use it independently."

Ah, of course. A solution to a problem that is vanishingly small.

The author might want to revisit the implicit premises that 1) there is a meaningful population of people who can throw together a working trading algorithm in a few weeks, let alone a profitable one; and 2) that the primary obstacle for this set of people to make money is the commission structure.

They also mentioned the cost of data access, but I don't see a solution for that in their proposal; data access and cost is honestly a much more significant starting barrier to entry than fees."

You're right, Larry Williams doesn't use fourier transforms -- he uses other (more primitive) methods to accomplish a similar goal."
2017-05-31 10:33:47,"Thanks for your great insight. 
I am looking at delta1 (adj. closing price today - adj. closing price yesterday). I then plot the FFT of this to find the peak frequency and then determine an appropriate window. If the peak is at low frequency the window will be long, if it is at higher frequency the window will be shorter. I'm thinking of plotting the frequency vs. time to see how the peak frequency changes, since there might be temporary ""shocks"" of high frequency peaks which I would want to ignore. Also perhaps thinking of taking the top 3 frequency peaks to minimise the shock factor again. Another question is - how often should the window be re-calibrated.
Here's a paper on frequency portfolios you might find interesting: http://alo.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spectral_14_standard.pdf"

He is not shy about confronting guest speakers with hard questions. 

The huge library of video and software content FIO (and the users) produce is of special note. You can find pretty much anything there - or at least find someone willing to help you in getting why you need. 

However there is one aspect that often leads to consternation: the paywall. There is an ""elite"" section that has a couple of non-public subforums, videos and files. It costs a one-time fee to get access. IIRC it's $100 right now. The reasoning for this paywall is that a) it pays for the running costs and b) it keeps out spammers, scammers and troublemakers. 

Well, I can say that b) definitely worked. It's a completely different atmosphere from any other trading forum I have been a member of. The question of whether the free section of the forum should be closed entirely, because it generates a huge workload for the moderators while not being a big benefit to most active users, tends to come up again and again. 

You also get the advantage of people sharing their ""secret sauce"" freely. While there is no holy grail in trading, the collective insight and experience really is worth those 100 bucks and then some. Likewise, the video content and software alone is worth several orders of magnitude more than the fee. 

But to get back from the sales pitch, the free content is pretty great on its own. E.g. anyone interested in algotrading should at least watch Kevin Davey's videos. "

2017-05-30 11:15:58,"I am researching exactly the same subject (FFT analysis of financial data) this summer. I am taking an extremely careful and deliberate approach .. right now treating financial data as ""music"" .. meaning trying to glean information out of spectral shifts (as predictors for example). I am using Python and Julia. If you continue along these lines I may ask your opinion about certain issues and offer mine to you. Meanwhile, when I get to work I will find a couple of articles that you may find useful and send you the links.

Right now I am using second data (bid/ask every second) for SPY but I have data for a large number of ETFs and some bellwether stocks like AAPL. I am using log continuous growth rate conversions of the data (are you?).

My sense of it is that you have to try to guess the highest likely frequency of whatever periodic waves are embedded in the data and then have a sample rate that is double that (from my experience, figuring this out is a little harder to do than one would guess) and then once you figure that out, normalize the amplitude so that you can break the amplitude range down such that it is covered by an 8-bit or even 4-bit sample. 

Kind of hard to explain the latter but for an example keep in mind that when music is digitized into a WAV file relative amplitude is normalized into a 2-bit hex range approximately -37K to +37K. 

This tedious approach that I am taking is part of an effort to avoid the equivalent of aliasing and clipping when running your data through a generic FFT like the ones provided in Python's fft library.

This is probably too confusing to help much but I will send a couple of links that may clarify what I am talking about here. And I am curious to see what others have to say about this."
2017-05-30 11:13:32,"The metatrader platform is used by brokers for retail traders. It can be manipulated against you. Also MQL4 and 5 are basically C and C++ but MQL4 is being brought closer to C++ now like MQL5 since people still don't like MQL5 which has been out for a while.

While you might be able to use metatrader for other asset classes, your broker has to support it and it is harder to find the brokers that use it for non forex.

I learned MQL5 and really the only place you can use it is within metatrader, python can be used everywhere. I would go with python if I were you."

2017-05-30 01:14:37,"Simply put, no, unless you are interested in being a risk quant for a big bank. Profitable alpha-generating quants, sometimes even ones in the same firm, rarely speak to one another. They put food on their table with the edges they found in the market, and will rarely disclose even seemingly trivial details. A competitor can learn a little here, and a little there, and eventually they have a decent prior on how your trade operates. Why narrow their search space? Loose lips sink ships and all that.

There are some academic conferences on econ and microstructure that produce interesting papers, but you can usually download them online. You probably don't know enough to differentiate ivory tower crazy research from useful stuff at this point in your career, so don't bother.

What you want is to find a mutually beneficial position with someone who will teach you the ropes. Think of it like an apprenticeship. Get technical skills that can help a trading desk or exchange, show your merit, and hopefully find a good mentor along the way.

If you're lucky enough to find such a mentor, just work your ass off and listen closely. The most valuable things you learn won't be how a particular trade works, but a mental model of how profitable ideas are generated.

2012-10-09 18:11:57,"&gt; I'm trying to find volatility which I had read as std dev log returns. The wikipedia page was ambiguous about which sort of returns to use and defined log returns as ln(Pf/Pi)/t where t is the time between the two measurements.

say you have the following sequence of daily prices:
10
11
9
8
9
13
11

the respective log returns (continuously compounded returns) is:
9.53%
-20.07%
-11.78%
11.78%
36.77%
-16.71%

take the standard deviation of this last list and that is the historical volatility (21.85% a day).

&gt;  I would like some measure of how risky a given portfolio is. I wrote sharpe and sortino ratio algorithms, but would like to extend the notion of log returns to a multiple asset portfolio. It is difficult to do this if there are transfers on the number of assets as it messes with the weights given to each and precludes using the total value of the portfolio at each polling interval as the basis for the standard deviation of log returns. A friend recommended what he called portfolio standard deviation which used the weight of each asset at the end of the evaluation interval and the covariance matrix of the assets.

again, what are you trying to get ? the historical volatility of an existing fund ? it's the same way as in my example, ignore individual components, discretionary rebalancing, just get the end of day (month) quote of the fund, do the calculations i showed you and that is its hist volat. 

alternatively, if you get the fund's each individual assets' variances and covariances, and last individual weights, you can find the portfolio std deviation. but it will be a different number from the above because the weights, correlations and variances have not been constant. it is a good proxy of volatility if the portfolio is going to be held passively from today and on. 
"
2012-10-09 15:30:29,"First, I'd like to thank you for your response. Where did you acquire this knowledge and is there a resource you could recommend?

&gt;&gt;When measuring returns is it ln(Price at current date / price at beginning)/days from beginning or is it ln(price from current date / price from previous date)?

&gt;i dont understand this question: what are you trying to get ? create a column in your excel of log returns, LN(Pt/Pt-1)-1. take the avg and std dev of that.

I'm trying to find volatility which I had read as std dev log returns. The wikipedia page was ambiguous about which sort of returns to use and defined log returns as ln(Pf/Pi)/t where t is the time between the two measurements.

&gt;&gt;Measuring the standard deviation or volatility for a single stock is easy enough, but how do I measure it for a whole portfolio which might have transfers in of assets or other trades that make total assets held non-constant?

&gt;again, it depends on what are you trying to get. your question is useless if you dont understand the basics. we could address it later tho.

2012-10-09 12:09:38,"&gt; why is it standard deviation of log return rather than returns?

because log returns have a more normal distribution then simple returns that have a lognormal distribution (confusing wording but simple concept). the distribution of simple returns is skewed to the right (you cant fall by more than 100%), the log of returns takes care of that. being skewed fucks up the concept of a std deviation.

again, it depends on what are you trying to get. your question is useless if you dont understand the basics. we could address it later tho.

fix in your mind the following concept 1st: say you are interested in the VAR of a stock, 1st you find the quantile given the std dev of log returns and the average of log returns, that is, given an average and std dev of log returns, that are assumed to be normally distributed, what is the log percent return that marks the bottom, say 5% of this distribution. meaning: assuming the distribution of log returns is normally distributed, what is the return that indicates that 5% of all returns are below it ? so it is the mean plus the std dev * -1.645 (the 5% quantile). NOW, pay attention, that return is in log return, so you have to convert it back to simple return in order to tell people what the 5%VAR is. so you exp(the return you found) - 1. and that is the VAR@5%. it will be a return(likely negative) or an amount of money if you multiply this final return by the initial investment."

&gt; Actually I'm not -- this post comes from someone who has done work in HFT. I haven't seen a single paper to suggest that tightened bid-ask spreads have any social utility. The function of the public equity market is to let companies raise cash as well as give people an opportunity to invest in said companies. Any ""improvement"" that HFT offers is just... extremely unimportant. I would argue given the amount of resources and talent that goes into HFT, it's actually a net negative externality in terms of societal value.

&gt; Before you come back with an argument that tightened bid-ask spreads add societal value, be sure to be able to make some kind of causal link. I.e. ""here is data to suggest that tightened bid-ask spreads helps society"". Until you can do that, maybe you should question your own set of assumptions. HFT is going to become much more tightly regulated -- it's a matter of time. It's already happening in Europe.

&gt; Edit: Just looking through your post, I think it's obvious I'm a hell of a lot more educated than you are, so keep that in mind before you go the ad hominem route you were already treading on.

&gt; ...[Right ](http://apotential.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/sarcastic-okay-gif.gif?w=584)

&gt; At the end of the day, the markets can perform fine without HFT, like they had for many, many, many years. HFT is just a way to create profits from trading -- I'm okay with arguments that it provides liquidity, but to stretch it as far as to say it contributes to social welfare is just drinking too much from the kool-aid, sorry.

The significant and positive correlation of 0.0086 between them implies that a high lagged kurtosis is positively associated with stock return""). **So let's summarize this garbage: the effect of kurtosis on a cross section of stock market returns is NILL**.

- what is the period and frequency of the returns ? are they monthly or annually and how far back does it go for each of the years tested ( from 81 to 2011) ?

- why did he get a correlation between stuff and the log of price, instead of the log of the return (or the difference between logs of prices) ? 

if anybody disagrees that this was some serious junk please explain why.

They are primarily a business website but they do have excellent research as well. http://www.nanex.net/FlashCrash/OngoingResearch.html

Once and HFT gets its quote, it then scavenges the L2 quotes looking for orders that are mis-priced and fills them. Here the algo makes money from the mis-pricing but has to pay an exchange fee for taking liquidity away from the market. This hunting is what many believe breaks the markets, while others think it takes away the inefficiencies.

Other market making algorithms take a different approach, where they post orders that will be as close to the front of the line as possible, once receiving a quote. Their orders get filled and they receive money from the exchange for providing liquidity. These algos usually have to hedge their positions when they get a fill to prevent losses should the markets move."

2012-07-17 06:18:46,"Well its basically bet size * expected profit * number of bets, if you have even a 50.0000001% chance of winning a fair bet, and you can play that a statistically large number of times your profit will start to reflect that.

However the higher the frequency the lower the max return per trade as the market has moved less.
"
2012-07-17 04:35:10,"Does it *need* to be high frequency to be profitable? No, definitely not. Take a look at Mebane Faber's work, for example, and you'll see that very low-frequency algos can potentially be quite profitable given enough time.

However, given a level of skill, does higher frequency imply a higher chance of profitability? Certainly. Grinold's Fundamental Law of Active Management holds that:

IR = IC . (BR^0.5)

where:

IR is your information ratio (i.e. your risk-adjusted profitability)

IC is your information coefficient (i.e. your skill), and

BR is breadth (i.e. the number of independent bets you take each period)

Mo' bets, mo' skills, mo' money.

Of course, breadth in and of itself doesn't automatically imply higher frequency, but in practical terms (and given a finite amount of capital) you can only up the number of bets you take above a certain level by upping the frequency with which you take them. This is why high-frequency algos can generate very profitable performances even on miniscule individual information coefficients."

2012-07-16 14:35:54,"IB gives you free intraday data, however, depending on the time horizon you're looking at, it may nor may not suffice. "
2012-07-16 14:06:00,"Putting a backtested strategy into production is about 10x harder than creating a model and backtesting it.  If you are thinking about creating your own infrastructure to handle trades, I would seriously advise against it because there are so many nuances.  I would go with something like Ninjatrader or one of its peers that you can use to create your strategy.  Even with using one of those frameworks, there are still so many things you have to worry about, but at least you're not starting from scratch.

Here's a short list of what I can think of off the top of my head:

   1) I'm not sure if you are a programmer, but if you aren't, then I would be extremely careful.  There are so many ways you can fail and get yourself into a potentially financially catastrophic situation, you really need to spend a lot of time doing debugging.  If you are a programmer, then handle every single error condition you can think of.  This requires more testing than you can imagine, because you're dealing with your own money at this point.  Test every single error condition.  If you can simulate your own data feed and order engine, then that is the best way to go about it.

   2) Anticipate the worst case scenario, like your internet connection going down, or your data feed going down.  This has happened to me, in the middle of the night, in the middle of a trade.  Are your bracket trades OCO?  Are these OCO orders sent directly to your broker?  Or are they held at your computer?  Ninjatrader holds OCO orders on your computer, which is fucked up, but there's not much I can do about it.

   3) Be extremely knowledgeable about the different phases of how a trade is placed.  Each API and even each exchange has different nuances.  For example, some exchanges will send back ""order accepted"" messages, others won't.  

   4) I use limits and stop limits to enter my positions, especially on IB because I found their fills to be terrible.  Market orders are easier because you're essentially guaranteed of being filled, but your entry price is not strict, and if you go with brokers like IB, then your fills could be shitty.  If you decide to go with limit orders, you need to figure out how to handle the situation where it kisses your order, and either partially fills or doesn't fill at all, and then hits your target.  Partial fills could cause chaos if you don't handle this situation correctly, because for example, if you have an order to buy 10 contracts, and you get filled with 3 contracts, does your target sell order use 3 contracts?  Or 10?  What if you later get filled on the rest of your order?  Do you update the sell order?  Or do you place another trade to sell 7?  These have to be handled completely otherwise you could get yourself in a net short position unknowingly."
2012-07-16 13:45:58,"That absolutely makes sense. So you're doing everything exactly like you would for live trading, except the trades are simulated? If you don't mind sharing, what API/broker are you using?"
2012-07-16 13:15:24,"nope.
backtesting is really just the first stage of testing -- you need to forward test in a live environment to understand the sort of problems that may arise. (e.g.: your connection may be dropped; the internet may go down;your broker could be having issues; you might be connected but not receiving data; the dll or  other component that does your calcs may have crashed.. and so on)"
2012-07-16 12:45:27,"I have worked with IQfeed, and I would give it high marks all around. Then again, I haven't used IB's data so I can't compare, but I know that IQFeed doesn't consolidate their data like IB does."

2012-07-16 12:31:34,"never tried IQFeed, so I have no idea.
"
2012-07-16 12:23:41,How would you rate IB against IQFeed?

Algotrading seems interesting, and I've been looking into it lately. One thing has kept me puzzled thought. 

Do I need to make a HFT system for algotrading to be effective? I'm imagining that building a HFT system is quite expensive.

Or is it possible to build algotrading-software that does a relative small amount of buy/sells each day?

    PERIOD = 1
    for each security:
        for each matching article:

you would then have to determine how sentiment actually affects price movements, then alter the signal generation from whatever system you are using (say a faber timing system) to include the 'sentimental metrics'. this is where lots of backtesting would come in. it would have to be over long periods too because markets are damn slow to react to information, just look it facebook, it took 3 months to drop 50% in value, why didnt that drop happen in 1 day or 1 week?

Ok, I see what you're saying: assume a risk-free rate equal to 0% for the purpose of comparing the Sharpe ratios of a strategy and a benchmark.

My original thoughts were that if you don't incorporate some risk-free rate, then you're assuming that it's better to sit on cash than it is to hold some risk-free security that has a return greater than 0%."

This probably sounds dumb but to be honest, at my firm, we've always talk about the ""raw"" sharpe and people generally have a good idea of what the market (benchmark) sharpe was over the same period. (ie: backtest is sharpe of 2.0 and market sharpe was 0.4 over the same time period, clearly better). Does this simple comparison really miss the essence of the problem?"

2012-08-14 21:14:26,"Ok, I'm getting confused here, so let me try to figure out what you're saying. Look at [this paper](http://www.edge-fund.com/Lo02.pdf) on Sharpe ratios, specifically at equation 3b on the second page of the pdf. If we assume that the returns are i.i.d., we're able to apply the CLT. If we let T=252, then taking the square root of equation 3b gives us an estimation of the standard deviation. 

Based on your comments, are you saying that the standard deviation of returns is already assumed to have been calculated using 1/sqrt(252)?

Edit: Never mind, I think figured out the problem here. n0ndual1ty's and azmenthe's equations are both correct. To annualize the ratio, you need to multiply the mean by 252 and the standard deviation by sqrt(252). If you factor out that fraction you'll see that 252/sqrt(252) = sqrt(252). Then the equation turns into this:


SR = (252 x mean - rf) / (sqrt(252) x stdev)

=(252/sqrt(252)) x ((mean - rf/252) / stdev)

=sqrt(252) x (mean - rf/252) / stdev

Someone correct me if I'm wrong."

Edit: Wrote this on Iphone, What I meant to say was you need to sample at a lower frequency as you are probably not 100% of the time in the market so the lower frequency results would be more realistic when annualized.

There are 252 trading days in one year. Sum the daily returns over that one year period and divide by 252 to get the average daily return. Use that average to compute the standard deviation over the 252 days.

2012-08-13 16:44:48,"&gt; If the underlying asset were to trade down 9% you would still have cash in the account, right? 

- Right (assuming im long 1 contract), I would have lost 13% (1.4 x 9% market move against me) and still have $43k in cash. 

- But notice enginerd03 talks about the INHERENT leverage of ONE futures contract, and that is 16 (70k/4,375). 

- So you are both right: Say instead my fund is worth $70k (and not $50k) and i trade only one Emini S&amp;P500 (same contract as above) once a month. My leverage is 1:1 and my margin-to-equity ratio is 6% (4,375/$70k). So, for trading that specific contract, a 6% margin-to-equity ratio translates to a leverage of 1.

"
2012-08-13 16:37:45,"I don't agree with enginerd03.

Your total exposure is only around $70k and you manage $50k so to my understanding, your leverage is only 1.4 to 1.

If the underlying asset were to trade down 9% you would still have cash in the account, right? So you're not leveraged 9%. I'm not a hedge fund accountant but when you can nearly buy the contract outright, that's a small amount of leverage."

2012-08-13 13:11:24,"but if i only trade for 3hrs every month, and during the day, and am cash for the rest of the month, isn't it unfair to say that my margin-to-equity ratio is the same as that for a fund of the same size that has sat on one contract for the whole month, day and night straight ? Is there a measure that addresses that ?"
2012-08-13 11:40:05,"nope.  but obviously the higher margin to equity the more youre exposed for a move against you.  if youre 40% margin to equity, you can take some losses without needing to cut the position.  at 95% margin to equity, a small loss could wipe you out."

2012-08-13 10:56:12,"to be safe, benchmark against the overnight margin 4375.  youre inherent leverage of the futures contract is 16x leveraged.

The possibility of algos going mad and tanking another companies stock is irrelevant, because as Cuban said about spreads, ""If you’re anything but a trader the change is of no impact to whether or not the company will be successful and create returns for investors."" That applies for things like flash crashes as well, which shouldn't affect an investor in any way because it doesn't affect the underlying businesses. I don't give a damn if Tyson Food Inc.'s stock falls $10 in one day if it's just because of some computers bugging out. It didn't change their business. "

"
2012-08-08 11:55:12,"I also have this question, but related to liquidity.  The ability to move prices in the options market is much greater, so how does one account for liquidity in the backtesting?  I guess this could apply to any relatively illiquid asset."
2012-08-08 11:18:08,"what instruments are you trading?  i trade futures and f/x and spent a lot of time researching actual trading slippage (non-commission) slippage over many years.  right now i use those on a per lot per contract basis in back testing.  for commissions just a fixed amount, usually around 15 dollars / contract in slippage.  always want to use worst case in backtesting.  PM me for more details. "

2012-08-07 21:46:33,"Remember, that when you use an ACF or a pacf on the entire sample you introduce a form of bias when backtesting, use something that either continuously estimates/optimizes your parameters or identifies a stable range....

2012-08-07 21:12:14,"&gt; Would you want signals on the forecast or the fitted?   

Fitted? To be honest, I don't know which would be more useful. I was planning on using the fitted data initially.

&gt;also in your trial, how did you estimate your parameters?  

I've been using the Acf() and Pacf() functions. For example using historical data from Yahoo (symbol: GE, adjusted close from 2012 YTD). I difference the data using diff() with parameter differences = 1,2, etc.  
A first difference results in the following: http://imgur.com/p2KMY  
A second difference results in the following: http://imgur.com/8SvMU  

The second chart shows the ACF drop off after 5 spikes and the PACF decays. So this suggests an ARIMA(0,1,5)? The first acf/pacf I'm not sure what to make of."

2012-08-07 08:30:31,"I don't equate Algorithmic Trading directly with High Frequency Trading. While all HFT is Algo trading, not all Algo trading is HFT. 

Algo trading can be very slow, having trading programs just look to hit a bid or lift an offer if a certain price or book size criteria is met. I just consider it a quantifiable strategy to trade.

HFT is where the regulation would happen; I could see a transaction tax for HFT participants who pull orders from the book *quickly*

"
2012-08-07 00:05:45,"The flash crash happened most likely because algo traders took advantage of arbitrage between the SPY and the S&amp;P 500 futures. When you buy an ETF, it doesn't directly send buy and sell signals to the underlying assets. The market maker buys shares of the ETF by trading the underlying assets in exchange for creation units. So, the market maker has to buy the underlying assets at some point to trade for the units, which then triggers buy signals, which usually happens long after the mispricing of the ETF can be traded on. This will be a big issue in the future; the mispricing creates contagion.

So, more and more algo traders hopped on the arb between SPY and the futures and caused the gap to widen dramatically in a very short amount of time. This triggered most of the well-written algo trading platforms to stop and eventually heavy buying driven by valuation brought it back up. All in about 90 seconds. The LSE wrote a paper about it. It definitely makes the most sense and is completely possible."
2012-08-06 23:40:48,"It would be nice to be able to exclude some events, but I think any deviation from the expected randomness of the market should be noted (including earnings and news). In theory, such a model would be able to tell you in real time where there are inefficiencies and other fringe events occurring in the market. A trader or algorithm could then act on these events, or you may find patterns which lead to new algos and models."

2012-08-06 12:01:22,"You know, I just realized that I didn't explain what happened in this thread, I did it in another. The tl,dr:  We received a price on QQQ of $~$40k, when it was trading at $40. Our system (option AMM) immediately updated our quotes in the market, and everyone sold to us. Within seconds we owned about 75% of all outstanding QQQ options. When we first ran a PnL report, it showed we were down $2 billion (Knight's market cap at that point was $2 billion- it was possible we wiped out the firm). Most of the trades were busted, the only ones that really stood were the ones executed on PCX, which didn't have volatility limit rules. "
2012-08-06 11:56:59,"Well, an error of that magnitude was not something we considered. Slow price feeds happened, and still happen all the time. Generally the loss from that is considered the cost of doing business. In my business, our fill rates just drop, so its more opportunity cost of lost revenue than an actual loss on our books. In the MM world, you can lose money, since you are quoting both sides. But to have a price be off by two decimal places, and have those trades be valid, that was certainly something we did not consider. "

I tried getting into &lt;60 second trades, but half the time my internet lags out, or the broker takes a long time to resolve the trade, or I just straight up missed my position because I'm watching tv.

From my experience GICS is a poor way of grouping as the number of clusters on a rolling basis over time varies quite large (IIRC 4-17 from my research), if you're in cash in 09 it's understandable given the SMA context, I would check into change point detection: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecp/index.html and Wildi's DFA work (http://blog.zhaw.ch/idp/sefblog/uploads/eco2_script.pdf) (this might help your entire problem) assuming you're not familiar with those two.

The results were underwhelming. Still not getting the proper response in spring 09, the strategy stays in cash for too long. 
I look for papers for exactly the same reasons you suggested – as a source of ideas which need to be tested. I was in academia and I know the pressure to publish even inferior papers. Why would you assume I would not reimplement a strategy that I would use for live money?

Papers are a good source of ideas that need to be further refined/developed by practitioners. I would highly doubt if you can find a good trading strategy from an academic paper, you'll find ideas that when you properly test them fall apart, or are inspiration for further work.

Also, the criminal complaint itself is a bit weird.  Exhibit A shows supposedly the effect of Sarao's trading on a ""non-crash"" day, May 4th.

There are numerous reason why bigger traders would have to give up certain winning daytrading algo strategies (many due to size of positions).

1) Time decay over time. As you mentioned, when it get's closer to expiration it is more noticeable, but it happens throughout the life of the option.

2) Implied Volatility. When a stock is expected to have a larger chance of moving in either direction, it is more likely to be worth something when it expires, and its Implied Volatility increases, increasing the value of the option. The converse of this is that if the stock is not expected to move at all, there is a lower chance of it moving into the money, and the implied volatility is lower, decreasing the options value.

The other could be the price it's being calculated over. SMAs typically use the closing price but maybe you want to experiment with highs, lows, or opens."

2016-04-04 10:17:57,"I've never worked on that time scale but a few issues seem obvious.  The first is that your backtests won't include you.  You affect the market with your trades.  You can try to model your effects, which is awkward and hard, or you can try to keep your trades small to minimize their effects, which limits your scalability.  You need to pay attention to the usual size and volume of whatever you're trading in either case.

Beyond that, there are the usual gotchas of backtesting: survivorship bias, data snooping, and overfitting.  I'm probably forgetting some.

2016-03-30 05:22:27,"Well, then you don't need to concern yourself with a platform to be honest.

First try to figure out what type of strategy you want to create and this is limited by the capital you want to use and the risk you are willing to take.

Second, I would think of trading style -- do you want to run MM strats on low volume equities, do you want to run mid-term high draw down stuff on forex, do you want to play with options (hard to get around, but easier to create nice strategies, very lucrative once you get your head around things) -- stuff I mention here are purely price based, other fundamental stuff require a lot more work and capital

Pick the one you want, do the research. Start with EOD data, then once u get a hang of it, explore lower freq possibly dishing out money for data....

Don't use a platform just yet. Just play around with R or Python/Pandas or whatever you are comfortable with. Heck, I have a friend who manages a billion dollar portfolio using Excel.

It is a waste of time getting ur head around the platform at this stage of ur trading.

It appears you're taking the 1D (one dimensional) data and applying a clustering algorithm to group similar ones (MeanShift) to establish clusters of trends.  Modifying the quantile variable you can change the clustering number selection criteria between 1 and 0.  For example 0.5 means that the median of all pairwise distances is used.

[Here is an example for 2D data.](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_mean_shift.html)

It seems the quantile selection would make a big difference in the outcome.  Is this correct?

I also understand that [1D data would be better analyzed using KDE](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11513484/1d-number-array-clustering) (Kernel Density Estimation)  http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/JEIF/article-full-text-pdf/71B36E84906

This depends on how deep you want to get into programming.  A good coder is agnostic about languages.  The concepts and patterns are very similar between different languages, it's just a matter of syntax and structure.  However only good dedicated programmers really reach that level.  If you're more interested in trading than programming then you should work with existing frameworks, IMO."

Given I only have detailed data to test back to 2010, that is as far back as my testing has gone. The system works over all time periods, however certain variables work best at certain times. (Variables meaning factor size, profit target, stop target and others). I understand the effectiveness of the system is based on it being complementary to the market environment. Of course this varies based on the other algorithms dominant at the time AND I feel the price if oil is a factor as well being that exposure per contract changes the volumes traded. Anyway..... is it more wise to use the parameters that give, perhaps less flattering, but more consistent results over all trials OR is it better to use the the parameters that yield the best results over the past couple years?

"
2016-05-06 12:24:51,"You'll eventually want to learn both - there is limited overlap between the general functions of the two languages. 

Have you done much programming before? If not, then my recommendation would be to start with SQL. It will give you a reasonably good grasp of the extract, transform, load (ETL) process within data warehouses. It's also much easier to grasp the general syntax and ideas behind SQL for a first time programmer.

If you *do* have some prior programming experience then I would say dive right into Python. The growing number of libraries allows for a huge number of applications - though the standard library is pretty great as well. Python will allow for automation of tasks that are otherwise menial. With programming experience there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to pick up SQL as well while learning Python. They both are important tools in the data analysis process. "

Elaboration: If you consider the act of trading as eroding a market inefficiency for a fee (which corresponds to your trading profit) then it should be obvious that today's inefficiencies (or call them effects or whatever) have also been present in the past.  Or put conversely:  The inefficiency you discovered today is *very unlikely* one that the market knew about before and all of a sudden decided not to cash in on anymore.

You basically covered it in your explanation why a strategy wouldn't be profitable for more than a couple of years."

2016-07-07 07:19:34,I'd be dubious of mean variance optimization. Most professional quants have moved on and don't use it any more. It used to work but markets have become more efficient.
2016-07-07 07:17:08,"Any well known factor like beta will be arbitraged out usually. Because so many people are trying to take advantage of it, slippage drives the prices back to efficient points where there is nothing left."
2016-07-07 07:15:54,"You need to approach this from a statistical hypothesis testing standpoint. In evaluating whether your model was predictive you should have come up with some metrics that would make sense. You'll probably have the usual ones like Sharpe Ratio and whatnot, but then also metrics based on the underlying ideas of your strategy. For instance whether the SNP is currently up or down, or the ratio of gold to the USD. What's important is to generate a confidence interval for where you think these values might reasonably fall during proper functioning of the algorithm, and then constantly check to see if recent values seem to be being drawn from a different distribution than when you were testing your algorithm.

You also have to define these, plus your risk tolerances like drawdown threshold a priori. Then be super rigorous about pulling a strategy off the moment your tolerances are exceeded. There is a super strong tendency to make excuses and keep a strategy on too long. Also, there is a tendency to not pull a strategy off because it is doing better than you expected. A strategy being over the upper tolerance is just as worrying, you should pull the strategy off and evaluate what's happening. It indicates you didn't understand the system just as much as it underperforming, and you need to figure out what's going on lest there be a big drawdown in the future."
2016-07-07 07:10:18,"In general ML algorithms are very tricky. There is a tendency to quickly and massively overfit ML models, because price data is so noisy and non-stationary. ML models tend to work well on stationary datasets, but in finance the minute you've fitted it the market has moved on, and the ML model is now too specific. That said I don't know how you're using it, and there are some powerful use cases. For example using ML to filter data, or to select attributes for a simple model which is then validated using conventional measures.

In practice financial model evaluation is a complex field with its own research. You want to look at consistency of predictive power over time, how many independent bets its making, and then also characteristics of a backtest. Real world effects like slippage and comissions can eat profits and analyzing those are important.

2016-07-04 15:59:25,"I think most people overestimate the complexity of programming.  Having said that, i could give it a shot.

I definitely think that relying too much on machine machine learning to define your parameters could create some problems. Cause in any finite expanse of time youre going to encounter patterns purely out of coincidence. On the other hand, you can also encounter meaningful patterns by identifying commonalities between all the incidences inwhich your trades lost money. But, exactly as i said you always run the risk of identifying a pattern that is simply the result of coincidence. For example, perhaps most of your profitable trades were with companies with market caps above x. At first glance it seems like the decision is clear, but on the other hand perhasp thats simply the result of coincidence. Similar to how people say it always rains on the weekend. The truth is you only notice when it rains on weekends. And an outsider trying to understand the weather through pure speculation might conclude that it only rained on weekends. But if they observed for years theyd realize that it actually rained more on the weekdays than weekends (simply because there are 5 weekdays for every 2 weekend days).

We've seen it many times, people release books with strategies that backtest phenomenally, but upon further inspection people always realize that at any point someone can identify some rules for which, had they followed them 50 years prior, they would've fared very well. It takes some level of insight of the reasons why something works to be able to separate the meaningful patterns from the noise. And dont get me wrong, you go down both avenues, leave no stone unturned. But depending on how many patterns you uncover youll need to prioritize the investigation of certain patterns over others. "

**Impression**
The ELI5-style explanation of the technical stuff is gentle enough for people with absolutely no CS or mathematical background, but not many punches were pulled on the finance terminology, so it's not quite encyclopedia-level introductory. It seems *quite* targeted toward an old-school-investing crowd.

**Content**
Nice concise intro to algorithms and the benefits of using computers to execute trades automatically. I don't think you missed anything significant!

**Suggestions**
I'm not so sure about your target audience here, but you threw a lot of not-so-overview-feeling stuff into the middle of your overview that you may want to dumb-down or explain better (consider hyperlinking to wikipedia for a few terms). An example of this would be ""...decimalization of trades, the growth of the FIX protocol and the sub-penny rule."" I feel there may not be many people who know what the FIX protocol and the sub-penny rule are but need a two-paragraph, making-a-sandwich-analogy-style explanation of what an algorithm is, so consider your audience a bit more, maybe!

Though this might depend on who exactly you are investing to, the biggest thing has very little to do with the actual product. The technical description will be the last thing you talk about.
Tell me exactly who your customer is. Develop a comprehensive persona of their daily schedule and actually interview people based around a set of hypothesis that you have that relates to the problem you think exists. 
If you can prove that problem is a major pain point that someone would pay money for then build your solution around that problem.
What makes you say coding etc is inexpensive? If getting it made is inexpensive why would I pay you to do it instead of hiring someone to do it myself. Anything requiring handling of money sounds complicated.
If you're coming into this with a proof of concept, show me that you have a rock solid and research backed understanding of your customers and a way to meet their problem. Then show me the minimum viable product you have.
If its just a set of algorithms like you mentioned above, then show me some kind of tangible results and tell me why no one else has done this before.

2016-07-01 02:12:44,"It's a concept not a thing - trading systems implement SOR.

So what it is and why?

When a ticker (or any tradable entity) is available at multiple locations (exchanges, darkpools etc), the trading system will make a decision about how it will distribute the smaller child orders of the parent order between those locations. 

(Note: This *""decision""* does not necessarily need to happen at the strategy level and could be done transparently at the OMS level or the strat could provide hints/directives about its preferences for its child orders)

The decision making process (aka business logic), will be based on a number of constraints and reasons:

1. Requirement for best price/time execution (mainly sell-side issue)

2. Market impact minimisation - send orders first to DPs then as the strat/algo falls behind reclaim back to the lit environments

3. Business priorities - brokers can charge more to execute orders in certain domains without violating [1], hence SOR is more about profiting from the client than providing best execution (sell side only)

4. But most importantly it's a term of differentiation, which sales/marketing people love, because it's something they can say is important and that the competition doesn't have but we do, so use our service and technology.

5. There's others...

In short for the most part it's a nonsense - a concept easily grasped by the lowest common denominator but for the most part of little to no practical use.

I know that the information you gather through classification is still very useful and not ""worse"". So I'm definitely open for both and just wanted some comments and suggestions. 

Already saw many times that people say it will just overfit, so it's encouraging to hear that it might work as long as you know what you do. You're right though, I'm more of a beginner in machine learning so I'll have to learn alot about it before I even know what to do against overfitting etc.

With ""simpler algos"" you mean algos without ML, don't you? I have to look into machine learning right now anyways, so I'll keep working on this too, but in the past I already tried to develop some algorithms without. Usually I had a few ideas, based on technical analysis, indicators etc. but after a few tests it was quite obvious that it wouldn't work. It's usually the ideas that I'm missing.

It seems to work, so you test it on a couple of years of held-out data.  Suppose it doesn't work on the held-out data.  What do you do then?  Do you go back and try an RBF kernel, this time using cross-validation to set two hyper-parameters with grid search?  Do you also try 10 other classifiers, because they are so readily available in your toolkit?  There is always a temptation to keep searching for a way to make the strategy work instead of giving up.  You don't want to end up empty-handed, after all.  This is multiple testing, because you have peeked at the held-out data more than once.  It increases your odds of finding a spurious strategy.

Think of it like searching for Easter eggs in a mine-field.  The more you search, the more likely you are to blow up.  A good bet is to use as much background knowledge as possible.  You think up an area where the odds of finding an egg are higher, and you limit yourself to looking only in that area.  Exploring many modeling techniques is just another way of expanding the area of the search.

If you only run a single regression to test an idea that you thought of from your domain knowledge, then the whole backtest can be used to confirm your hypothesis.  If you need to optimize hyper-parameters, then effectively only the limited amount of truly held-out data can confirm your idea.  So, there is an advantage to having no hyper-parameters or in using recommended values instead of optimizing them on the data.

Also, remember that other people may over-fit.  Recreating the results of a recent paper you read does not necessarily mean that it will work in the future."

2016-06-27 01:12:27,What are some other approaches besides Machine Learning that are commonly used in the algo/quant field?
2016-06-26 05:23:17,"I've experimented a decent amount with both regression and classification approaches in the FX markets. I tend to prefer the former and have implemented algos based on this approach. I remember reading somewhere that Ernie Chan also recommends a regression approach - sorry I don't have a reference though. I would however recommend experimenting with both. This shouldn't be too difficult to do once you've got your framework in place.

Regarding classification, you said ""classification only allows you to create long/short signals without knowing by how much"". This isn't exactly true. Most classification algorithms will calculate the probabilities of an outcome belonging to each of the classes you specify. For example, 0.65 that the next day's return will be positive, 0.35 that it will be negative (but in reality, your probabilities will likely be in the range 49-51). This information can potentially be useful.

Be warned that you will encounter a somewhat dismissive attitude towards machine learning in the algo trading / quant community. You'll be told countless times that you will very likely overfit to your training data. However, if someone is overfitting to the training data, they are doing it wrong, simple as that, and need to refine their workflow. Just because a tool is powerful does not mean that you shouldn't use it. Like any approach to the markets, there are pitfalls that you need to be aware of and if you disregard them, you will get yourself into trouble. The solution is not disregard the approach; its to learn to use it properly.

Having said that, the major downside to using machine learning in finance (in my opinion) is not the risk of overfitting (as mentioned above, this can be overcome by learning to use the tools properly); rather it is that you end up with a lot of moving parts in your development process and ultimately in your trading algorithm. Some of these parts can be quite fragile and have significant impacts if they ""break"". There are other models and approaches that are far less complex and therefore simpler to design and implement in practice. Many of these approaches are more than adequate for extracting profits from the market too.

Without knowing your background, my advice would be to successfully implement a simpler model first. You'll learn a lot and earn some money along the way (eventually). Once you're up and running with a simpler algo or two, dive back into machine learning. You'll need to expend significant time and effort to make it do what you want it to, so it makes sense to get some simpler algos up and running first. Apologies if that advice is out of line - you may well be already running some highly successful algos for all I know."

2016-06-24 08:59:35,"I admit I haven't tried regression techniques nearly as much as classification techniques when it comes to predicting forex movements, but that's largely because the regression results have been so poor to be meaningless.  Classification is a much simpler problem, and with something with as much noise as forex or any other equity,  I think it's all you can reasonably take a stab at.  And even then, I've found it massively difficult to develop models that actually work.  I've been working pretty hard and consistently for a year now on a forex algo trading system, and I'm still not there.  There are so many areas for error and even a single one will waste your time for weeks as you think you've got something, only to start live paper-trading it and realize its not working."

Take a look at this, it's doing 9% every day instead of 2 years but the drawdown is equivalent to it:

2016-06-23 19:39:26,"Yea, I already thought about that. Regression sounds better in theory but maybe won't really deliver good results."
2016-06-23 18:50:32,"Predicting stock returns involves looking for a tiny bit of structure in data that many smart people believe contains nothing but noise. From what I've seen, most quants stick with simple, intuitive methods. There is a strong preference toward parsimonious models (minimal number of fitted parameters). Overfitting is always a massive concern, even though we all know about cross-validation.

I think that intro informs the regression vs. classification question. Regression would be ideal for knowing exactly how strong the signal is, and whether it is worth the transaction costs and bid/ask spread. But, that is asking for quite a bit of information from the noisy data. Classification attempts to deliver something simpler, just the sign of the forecast. Classification may be more robust to outliers in the training data. So, a classification model may not tell you all you wish to know, but it may also be more accurate in what it does tell you."
2016-06-23 16:56:44,"A little bit of both.  I use a boglehead like value investing formula to crawl threw the market looking for undervalued stocks.  Ether it's not a very good crawler, or most stocks aren't usually undervalued.  But when it gets a hit, it compares the valuation of the held stocks, to the potential gain from the new one.  Decides if it should sell some and buy this new one, or not.  Sometimes it skims off a bit from a bunch of different holdings to buy a new stock, sometimes it sells a holding out right.  It has a few different options to consider when selling to generate cash, it also sends me an email asking if I want to transfer cash into the account.

Thats pretty much it, buy and hold for the long term, or until the stock becomes overvalued by enough that the bot doesn't consider it safe to hold, but so far that hasn't happened very often, so it's mostly buy and hold, skim some off the top or add cash and then buy and hold some more.

It's not glamorous, I often wonder if the bot is even on, since it does so little... But I'm up to around 9%, for the YTD, my numbers aren't anything huge to brag about, but they are good."

But for similar cases where it does make sense to use threads, usually what I do is setup some kind of work pool singleton object that contains all the data that the threads would be doing work on.  Threads can repeatedly request pieces of that work from the pool, do their task, and release it back to the pool.  For something like this, I would probably store all the work (SP500 symbols + related data) in some type of queue.  Thread requests for work would pop the top of the queue, do whatever work you want to do, and then release it back to the pool by adding it back to the end of the queue."

Anyhow, the only 2cents I have to chip in is this: based on your description, your approach seems as though it got really complicated without a lot of good justification along the way. Taking a slightly more KISS approach, you might consider breaking down and attempting to validate the pieces of your system to make sure each one actually increases your real-world performance/robustness/risk-management significantly in exchange for the complexity they add.

From everything I've learned in my (limited) studies, if you're just throwing algorithms and approaches together and hoping that *in combination* you concoct and edge on the market, your strategy is probably powered mostly on wishful thinking. That may really generic advice about overfitting, but it could be that your problem stems as much from an overly optimistic approach as it does from a specific overfitting problem, too.

Whatever is the case, best of luck to you!"
2016-08-15 01:35:54,"Depends what features you're after, by doing 1 you'd effectively discard any auto-regressive effects but you may run into seasonal auto-regressive effects (like if you take the 14:00:00 candle every day).

I don't know the model you're trying to fit but you could technically fit an AR model with consecutive candles, then add some AR-terms to your model that capture just the auto-regressiveness of the data and any other effect goes into your other terms.

Second idea is good and sound.  I'd even go testing the effects on data *before* the training set.  Because, you know, the arrow of time.  If you discover an effect with data from 2014 and 2015 then chances are the effect was also present in 2013 but someone *may* already cash in on the effect in 2016."

2016-08-14 15:42:03,"Your risk control consists of committee members voting; instead of picking them independently of each other, you can pick non-leading committee members based on your committee member. In essence, you will be tailoring your risk-control to the specific model that's trading by introducing an additional layer after your topN ranking where can you evaluate the performance of the committee as a whole. This is ONLY for the purpose of risk-control, which may have been controlled too much in your original set up, because your set-up CANNOT increase strategy robustness. You have an over-fit model and no matter what you do, you won't be able to expand its robustness, only refine signal-to-noise, unless your committee members can somehow influence (expand) the actionable set of conditions in which your top model will trade.
"
2016-08-14 15:21:47,"If I'm understanding correctly, then your problem can be boiled down to one thing: the model with which your trading is over-fit and the risk-controlling committee can't actually increase the robustness of your trading. If that is the case, then I can suggest a few things ...

1) Select your risk control control mechanisms based on your chosen trading model(s) -- this is the primary difference because this will validate your trading and risk control mechanisms commensurate with past dynamics. This is the area where you can hedge against over-fitting.

2) Consider using several trading models as part of a portfolio to increase the robustness of trading or what you refer to as the confidence of trading. You can then control relative leverage as a form of risk control.

3) When the committee buys or sells, consider weighing their respective decisions based on model type (i.e. contrarian/trend-following and time frame), market conditions and relative performance. For example, several longer term trend-following signals could overwhelm a short-term contrarian signal without good reason."

2016-08-14 14:20:25,"It sounds to me like your committee of models is a form of risk control given that only the single best model actually trades with an additional caveat: each over-fit model has only been tested individually (based on the top10 selection) and not tested as portfolio. If that is the case, then the only thing you're actually doing with this committee is refining the trade set of the top model (the parameters of which are also over-fit) such that you're reducing the number of potential trades which more than likely further reduces robustness depending on the other models that sit on the committee.

Maybe there is some successful strategy out there that uses moving average as part of its strategy, but it likely is one of many indicators. You really need to as cascol33 said, think outside the box, and I would say try adding/combining different indicators to maximize EV.  

In terms of one-time events, I would probably exclude them, as they are in my opinion, the one event in which it is difficult to see predictable patterns, as you have many competing players trying to buy/sell the asset simultaneously, over a very short period of time. The amount of players may change across assets, making it more difficult to ascertain patterns, not to mention the fact that you would have to be HFT quick to avoid losses/gain profits. If your timeframe is 15min/1h, odds are you probably are not HFT quick.

 I would say keep trying new things/indicators, and keep pushing the boundaries in terms of increasing your win percentage, increasing your profit, decreasing your maximum allowable loss, etc. It's a brutal business, and requires a rare combination of intelligence, determination and creativity to get through it.

2016-08-11 14:57:34,"my personal advice:

you are polishing turds, look elsewhere for trading ideas

spend 25% of your time reading the most highly recommended books and blogs on this subject, combing for ideas and the authors view of the markets. 

spend 25% of your time backtesting the best ideas you come across, focus more on result replication than performance analysis. use r for this. think carefully about every step in the process, ask yourself what they are doing and why, try to poke holes in EVERYTHING.

if you manage to replicate an idea's results and fail to find fault in the underlying concept/methodology, then spend 25% of your time working on implementing the idea, walkforward in a paper trading account.

this is the step you are currently on but you have not built a proper foundation, you skipped over the first two sequences and are simply polishing that turd as hard as you can, but deep down you realise what the results are going to be moving foreward.

if done correctly, at this point you should have a stable of 5-10 strategies and just like horses, you should be watching their performances over time. should you chose, you can just flip a switch from paper to live trading and be off to the races.

but here we comes to the last 25%: you want to look at how strategies can be blended with each other/tweaked/managed. start investigating beta models that would perhaps try to mitigate some of the risk you referenced ala brexit. remember you dont have to speculate... you can just wait out the shitstorm. in other words, many alpha models will just tell you the prices where you might want to buy/sell but you need more than that, you need to know when to field each horse and which groups of horses to race at the same time. it gets a lot more complicated than this and i have just tried to simplify it with this analogy. 

also note the 25% of your time allocated to each step is arbitrary and will change, in the beginning it should be closer to 50,50,0,0 until you actually find something worth walking foreward, then 25,25,50,0 until you have 5 to 10 strategies, then 10,10,40,40 etc etc

2016-08-11 12:52:20,"William Eckhardt, famous for his turtle trader experiment with Richard Dennis, has some interesting comments on moving averages in the following link (as well as a lot of other great insights). 

""Our aversion to summary statistics that obliterate structure extends to the trading systems themselves. For instance, we avoid moving averages of price in making trades. Such moving averages are popular mostly because they’re mathematically tractable, but they smooth away all the structural information inherent in the price data.

Another popular tool, the price breakout, may be far better than the moving average, but it still eliminates most of the relevant structure. A breakout trader keeps two pieces of structural information, the high and the low for a given time period, but ignores all the price structure in between. For this and for other reasons we judiciously avoid breakout trading in all parts of all our systems.""

2016-08-11 12:37:00,"Yeah I see that's true. I could imagine a non-volatile period being devastating for an EMA-strategy and maybe a trend-filter, as you said, is the way to solve it.

Yeah I plan to do that, but I'm not really comfortable letting my bot running lose even with small amounts of money right now.

2016-08-11 12:36:07,"You bet.  I forgot to include the following Python module I came across a while ago.

2016-08-11 12:14:30,"Bitcoin has heavy risk.  Yes you can make more money, but there's a huge risk your coins will be stolen by the exchange or hackers.  So it evens out.  That's why there isn't more competition in Bitcoin.

Try running your strategy on a highly liquid stock played by the HFT boys and girls on the NASDAQ."
2016-08-11 12:14:26,"A lot of people trade using MA's. They find a system that works for them, and some implement some kind of trending filter to make sure they are only trading when the market is in a trend. Once markets start to consolidate and trade sideways you will get whipsawed into heavy losses.

The market conditions might just be right for Bitcoin to trade an EMA strategy right now. 

It's not hard to write a trading strategy that backtests on historical data. It is hard to write a strategy that continues to perform on real-time forward-looking market data.

You should start trading your system with a small account. Get your feet wet. Embrace the losses that will come eventually."

Optimise for max sharpe ratio or similar, assuming your using predicted returns and the correlation matrix between assets this should get you a better risk adjusted return.

E.g. maybe your strategy evaluates every minute, and the average strategy sees an opportunity every hour, it might decide the optimal action is to sell some of your current holdings to buy into some of the new ones... in other words it handles it in a nice clean way when you also factor in costs of each action."

The reason being that my strategy involves filtering many many tickers (ideally an entire exchange) for ones that meet specific conditions). But i guess i could just use a handful, maybe il try to compile a list randomly as to avoid some bias. what about things like reverse splits or splits (how do they appear?)? my plan was to go to a library near me that has a bloomberg terminal, but now that you mentioned the limit im not so sure if its gonna be a fruitful trip. maybe il do what i said and just try to compile a list randomly as to avoid bias. on the other hand.. i could just stick with those tickers i suppose.

You could always program in constraints (limit total position size after the net position desired is determined by the systems). You may lose out on the juice that your systems are generating though.

In your backrests of your systems, look at the correlations in particularly stressed scenarios for each one. An idea could be to look at the top 5 or 10 worst drawdown periods for each system and look at what the correlations between each system were."

Alternatively If one system is saying buy 1 unit of X while another is saying short 1 unit of X, then don't buy any X.

Most exchanges make their feed specs available on their websites ([Nasdaq ITCH for example](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/dataproducts/NQTVITCHspecification.pdf)).

2016-10-18 14:53:28,"To be honest lots of people are confused about the terms to the point that many use them lazily. I prefer the term ""low latency trading"" over ""HFT"".

Regardless being successful in the field generally require a relatively new skill set. It is quite unique because you want to span three different domains, math / statistics, CS and trading. The more hard core HFT / Low latency you go the less math / statistics it is and the more CS and trading you need.

Why? Because the quicker you go the more discrete the world becomes and more importantly there is franky less time for you to do fancy math.

Having that said there is tons of data analytics in low latency trading as well. As the system generates millions of data points per day so you can't really understand it without analytics.

But if it more of the finding systematic trading strategies using quantitative methods you like then maybe more traditional algorithmic trading / investing is what you want. In that case we are talking about the quantitative buys side guys such as some hedge funds etc that has already been named in this thread.

They hire a lot of Phd:s but it is changing. Phd:s are very good at really understanding / developing new quantitative methods, which is important. However finding successfull quantitative trading strategies is much more about knowing trading patterns, understanding the data and knowing which quantitative methods are best given the current problem. So it is more practical than theoretical.

So learning about trading, trying to backtest your own strategies on like Quantopian and reading up on online resources such as https://www.quantstart.com will probably set you aside in an interview much more than if you know a little bit more about martingales than the next guy.

2016-10-17 18:21:29,"I think /u/tennis1337 response was spot on. Given your current background and your responses maybe HFT is not what you think it is.

HFT is a specialized subgenre to algorithmic trading and as other have pointed out it is very CS intensive. The problems that are solved in HFT is mainly about hardware, networks, extreme real time C++ development, handling enormous amount of data and last but not least safely developing, deploying and operating such a system. The latter has really become the focus for the last few years and will continue to be with increased regulation.

Are these any areas you are interested in and why?

What was it about algo trading that made you interested?"
2016-10-17 17:35:00,"Why are you trying to get a row for each second, if you're just going to NA out the data? There's literally nothing you can do with that, which you can't already do with the original.

Are you saying that the different tables have different non-overlapping time-stamps? If this is your approach, then I suggest you think hard about what it means to join tables defined on different domains. Do you only care about the timestamps where both tables have defined values? If so, trying to join on every single timestamp is a gigantic waste. Just take the intersect() of time-stamps between the tables, then sub-index the rows on each table where timestamp %in% intersect(). As long as they're sorted, you don't even need to join(), you can just cbind(). That will run blazing fast, with minimal memory footprint.

Otherwise, maybe you're trying to analyze the time series at too fine a granularity. Instead of second-wise periods, you may want to consolidate up to minute-wise or even five-minute wise. It's more likely that a significant proportion of the possible timestamps are defined, and an inner join is probably more meaningful."

2016-10-17 14:39:00,"It depends on how well you can currently program. 
If you don't know Python, just learn about the whole paradigm of coding will take a month of dedicated work. Then toss in algorithms and data structures and analyzing cost bounds and learning about pointers and memory management ... definitely will take much longer than a summer. 

MIT has good courses on OCW for learning the basics of data structures and algos. 

C++ Primer by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo is a good primer of c++. Its long as it takes things really slow. 

Though in all honesty man, it sounds like you just do not currently have the background to jump into HFT. 

I would recommend a masters in computer science, hopefully from a top 5/10 school. Take classes on operating systems, networking, compilers if you want to build the trading in fracture. Take classes in statistical learning, convex optimization, etc if you want to do the machine learning. But you def need more training and I think it needs to be formal vs reading books. 

With respect to mid-tier companies - the quant HF space is very opaque. There are 5-10 people firms out there you've never heard of making crazy returns. You hear about the big ones (Shaw, AQR, Two Sigma, Citadel, PDT Partners, Renaissance for quant hedge funds) (Jump, HRT, Virtu, Teza etc for HFT) but even 'lesser well known' ones are still selective as hell (Capula, Ellington, ManAHL). 

I don't think you quite realize the bar for entering these firms. Consider a top HFT firm. In real time, they are making trades ever 10^-6 seconds. The trades are based on thousands of incoming real time data sets that need to be cleaned, stored and analyzed. Many of these companies have developed their databases that rival or greatly out preform the best ones out there, they develop machine learning techniques that will only be 'discovered' by academia years later. The field attracts some of the brightest minds in the world. And its a small world. Two Sigma is one of the largest funds out there and its around 1000 people. Google easily hires over 1000 people a year. 

From a recent article on Two Sigma: 
“In fact, Two Sigma’s data scientists and systems analyze more than 10,000 data sources, using 75,000 CPUs with 750 terabytes of memory.”  - Insane

A note: some would suggest a masters in computational finance / financial engineering. If you look at placement of even the top schools, 1/3 do trading at banks, 1/2 do research/risk at banks, and the remaining are scattered in prop shops, hedge funds, etc. Def not an exit for HFT firms and few students make it to the quant HF space. 

Note 2: If you do get the masters in computer science, there is no guarantee of landing a position in an HFT firm. Its just that hard. But you could end up maybe in a software position at Google or Facebook or a small hedge fund where you could build your skills more before potentially moving to a HFT firm.

If you are new to programming, I'd dedicate no less then 4-8 hours a week to learning, depending on how easy it comes to you naturally. The more time, the better, obviously :) 

There's lots of resources online you can follow. You don't even need Windows, you can use Linux and gcc to get started. If you have Windows though there's plenty of free compilers and IDE's you can use. 

Just google 'learn c++' and go. "

2016-10-17 10:45:06,Interesting! Thanks for the clarification. Would learning it on the side be sufficient? 
2016-10-17 10:02:39,"That is true.

What Masters programs would be most fitting for this field? "

You would do well to pursue a postgraduate course of study at a target school, you might also want to consider some academic extra-curriculars."
