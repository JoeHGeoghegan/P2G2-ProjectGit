So if I was to start over I would absolutely go with 3....Unless there was some obscure library which relied on 2 which I HAD to use."

2015-02-14 22:56:39,"I still use 2, and same for work. Sucks when you are knee deep in something and you need a library last minute that was never updated for 3. 3 doesn't introduce enough to outweigh that liability for me."
2015-02-14 22:56:29,"Several issues with your post:

* I don't see what the big breakthrough is here, you weighted the levels of the book, I was expecting some kind of noise process to be fitted where the expected change (or instability) of some size and level would be modeled over the latency period it takes you to execute.

* Your post does not do anything to identify ""spoofers"" as that's pretty much impossible.

* Finally, if ""spoofing"" which is a serious allegation in itself and illegal in the U.S. was happening, the SEC would love to see your evidence and would likely hire you on a on a consulting basis (you do appear to be selling those services).

I adapted my ANN software from another purpose, but I may have to abandon and look into alternates. I'm beginning to thing a decision tree whose architecture is optimised using a ANN might be worth an experiment..."
2015-02-13 10:08:08,"What kind of ANN have you tried? What was the structure of the net? What kinds of features did you use? I know people who have used ANNs for more than two decades, so they seem to work. But without knowing more about your application there is no way to tell what your issue is. It might even be the case that there simply is no helpful hidden information in/preceding a price gap, so there is no practical way to predict what happens next.

I have found SVMs to be useful when used to identify entry points. ANNs are great when they work but a) it's harder to get them to work and b) they take up much more performance. SVMs are much quicker to train and to test. We are looking for patterns after all, so why not use the best better matcher we have instead of a massive general learning model? Also, I can see that there should be value in using markov chains/HMMs to predict future price very similarly to voice recognision. But I don't know much about them. I also want to try a convolutional ANN or a Hopfield net for pattern matching but haven't had the time, yet. "
2015-02-13 09:46:22,"The more penalizing slippage assumptions you give yourself, the more profitable the models will be if the backtest works.  It also depends highly on the model you are trading.  For example if your model trades orders on Limits, its safe to assume lower slippage, then say stops.  In general for futures trading on Stops a safe bet is about 30 dollars/round turn for slippage, execution &amp; clearing costs.  For Limit Orders, 15/round turn.

I don't know about options, but probably at least the spread + 10% + commission &amp; clearing charges."
2015-02-13 05:20:15,"Yeah cache missing causes slow down is correct and I agree. But the sentence ""large amount of data in memory will slow down any CPU"" is misleading. Keeping data in memory won't slow down CPU, only memory accessing and cache missing will slow down CPU.  
Also large amount of data may or may NOT cause cache missing. It depends on the algorithm and how it optimizes. For example, we can split the data to hot data and cold data. We can make the hot data adjacent in the memory to improve cache hit. Cold data can spread in the memory anywhere because the data is rarely used so cache missing is not a problem. Just an example. There are several ways to improve cache hit, reducing data set size is only one of them.

&gt; Have you tried training a network to predict the next few units (seconds, days, etc.) prices given the previous N prices? For example: training a network to predict the next day's close given the previous 5 or 10 closes?

Yes, there is no significance in the price data alone no matter which way i chop it. my network just predicts an average basically (which isn't necessarily completely useless), but can't identify any extreme cases to any degree.

&amp;nbsp;


I think this is fundamentally at odds with the notion of **portfolio** margin, where by definition the margin required for a new position is also a function of existing positions.

Even if IB provided the breakdown of each position's contribution to the current portfolio margin requirement, they would only be valid for the current portfolio and time. They could conceivably all change due to a single position change, or even market movements alone.

Rather than relying on IB's margin calculation, I'd suggest you derive an exposure metric independently. Afraid I can't contribute much here as I don't have much experience with options. "

I am not sure, but wouldn't be too surprised if IB kept the formula they use proprietary.

You have to main options here.  You could switch to Reg T, which is easier to keep track of.  Or, you can stop trying to squeeze every last penny of margin out of IB.  If you are even close to the limit, IB thinks you are risking too much for them to bankroll.  You should probably listen to them

Yes, Mt. Gox lost a lot of people a lot money. No, that probably wouldn't have happened if insurance or regulatory oversight was in place. But as the MF Global reference proves, it's still possible.

2014-01-30 02:00:14,"&gt;33 sigma...

Assuming the universe is 14 billion years old and that you're measuring events at intervals of 1 Planck second, which according to quantum mechanics is the smallest unit of time that can be measured, then the probability of what you observed would require more time than the entire universe has existed.

The above is actually an understatement, it would actually require more time than the universe is expected to exist according to the heat death model of the universe, an event which is expected to happen in 10^150 years from now.

Believe it or not... my last paragraph is also an understatement but I simply have no other concept by which to express how unlikely a 33 sigma event is.  At any rate, my point is that you likely did not really observe a 33 sigma event, but only miscalculated one.

 [**Virtual bidding**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual%20bidding): 

---

&gt;**Virtual bidding** is a strategy implemented in various [Independent System Operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_System_Operator) electricity markets of trading Day-Ahead prices against Real-Time (or Hour-Ahead) prices. The term ""bid"" can be used loosely in electricity markets to refer to an offer to buy or to sell. And the term ""virtual"" is used to refer to the fact that, while these trades occur in a physical market, virtual trades never entail taking a physical position—because every sell (or buy) Day Ahead will be closed by a buy (or sell) in Real Time. The ISO maintains a trade execution system that ensures all virtual positions will be closed before delivery time. A virtual bidding platform gives financial entities a way to participate in these physical markets, with no physical assets or presence on the grid. They can attempt to capitalize on regular divergences between these markets of different time period for the same underlying (perhaps using time, absolute price levels, or other external variables as conditioning factors). If this strategy of trading one time period against another without the intent (or perhaps even the ability) to deliver or receive physical power is implemented outside of a transaction system that identifies virtual bids and ensures they will be closed, it may be referred to as ""implicit"" virtual bidding. Virtual positions are included in the same simultaneous feasibility tests and price determination processes as real positions. Thus they can serve to reduce inefficiencies in the market.

2014-01-29 21:45:23,"As someone who runs a trading firm your company is right to shut down that algo based on the information you supplied and I would have done the exact same thing.

You represent that your algo lost 1 million dollars in a single day due to what you claim is a market under-reaction, or really just a series of events that you were unable to forsee or predict.  Another series of events that you likely also didn't forsee or predict had you making 12 million or possibly 100 million dollars or a bazillion dollars, who knows...

Yes, it's possibly that when the market behaves in ways one can not predict one can make a significant sum of money, but that's irrelevant.  The most important aspect of an algorithm is predictability and adherence to a model.  If your algorithm can not accurately model the market that represents a fundamental risk to your firm, regardless of whether the inability to predict the market happens to result in a large gain or a large loss on some particular day.

Once it's established that the algorithm is unable to accurately model the market, the company must shut it down.  It's never worth it to risk an entire firm's capital on a bet like that, even if the bet would happen to pay off.  The downside is that the firm ends up losing a great deal of money and laying off staff or even closing down its doors (which happens quite a bit).

It might suck to hear that and it might seem unfair, but from the point of view of the firm it was the right decision to make.  If it really really is the case that your algo can reliably produce profits and predict market trends as opposed to simply lucking out and making a bazillion dollars from some one time fluke, then the burden is on you to present that case, show the data, produce the evidence and take it from there.

It's a tough business but that's the way it really has to be."

The difference in the numbers is accumulated. Given this situation, would you on average have a positive or negative total?

2014-01-11 05:41:15,"Apologies.  I was actually just looking at the picture before I saw your comment and I realized it probably wouldn't make much sense to someone unfamiliar with the software (Metatrader 5).  

Here's an explanation:

I've coded my trading strategy with a number of variables, such as take profit, stop loss, RSI period, RSI stoch, buy signal threshold, etc.
For each variable I set a range of values that I want the software to run through.  For example, we could try a stop loss value from 5 to 25.  The software then goes through the training set many, many times with some values for each of the variables and sees how the strategy performs.  We then pick the best strategy of all of the trials (here best means most profitable).

It's a bit hard to see, but if you zoom in there are dates along the x axis at the bottom.  It's just one picture and the left side is earlier in time than the right side.

First the algorithm was optimized over the right region of time (black line to end) and the line shown is the best result obtained after optimization. Account balance is on the y axis.

Now, that strategy looks pretty good right? It turned $4000 into $11500 in around 7 months and only lost two trades.  Too good to be true? Yep.

So then we backtest (run the strategy over an earlier region of time it never trained for) and see that the strategy is terrible.  A 5 year test confirmed that it sucks everywhere else :)
 
What happened is we overtrained the strategy to that one section of time.  Sure it performs amazing there, but it loses
everywhere else. A simple solution is to train over a longer time period, or not train for as long (avoid overtraining).  If you optimize a 
strategy over a small time period (week, month, year, even a couple years) for a long time, you will get an amazing reported profit
but its really unlikely the strategy will work elsewhere.


I hope that makes sense, ask away if you have more questions.

Lemme 'splain...

With SPY, there are no grounds for stating whether or not today's action is related to yesterday's. The SPY **is not** a coin flip - it's a reflection of the aggregate of millions of independent decisions - and the only thing we can say for certain about today vis-a-vis yesterday is that it follows it in time. 

A beginning trader **has to** do this kind of statistical analysis to know what degree of correlation exists. The results he got are what we would expect, (that it is roughly equivalent to a coin flip), but he can't know that going in. I think his analysis is absolutely essential for a beginning trader.

2014-01-07 04:48:37,"Hi Chainsaw,

The best way to get started on this sort of analysis is with the 'pandas' library (http://pandas.pydata.org/). It provides a lot of out of the box functionality to carry out many of the tasks you describe. In particular, you can download large datasets with it. It also provides sophisticated date alignment of data-sets and basic data analysis methods. There's a ""ten minutes guide to pandas"" video which is also helpful (http://vimeo.com/59324550). 

To install it you'll need NumPy and SciPy installed too, which can sometimes be problematic to get working! You may find the free Enthought Canopy IDE (https://www.enthought.com/downloads/) will save you some time as well.

2014-01-03 01:29:25,I should do a Master's.  Seems like an obvious topic to get in a publication. 
2014-01-02 20:46:55,You are grossly over-estimating the quality of the published literature.
2014-01-02 17:44:24," 1. This is generally not a good IDEA!!!!!

As you would need to do a loop with the probability up to some point t and then use your estimate to trade after point t.

You can compare this to buy and hold (You should beat it).

 2. I did it in R, load your favourite sp500 object or stock to replace, quantmod is being weird for me today.

You can do counts too but I preferred avg return after the events.

    ##Dumb_pattern 
    library(quantmod)
    ##sp500_monthly
    ##Create sign
    sp500_sign = sign(sp500_monthly)

    ##Create matrix with prev 2 events
    sp500_1 = lag(sp500_sign,1)
    sp500_2 = lag(sp500_sign,2)

    sp500_mat = merge.xts(sp500_monthly,sp500_1,sp500_2)

    ##Create conditional prob spaces
    prob_double_up = sp500_mat[sp500_1==1&amp;sp500_2==1,]
    prob_double_down = sp500_mat[sp500_1==-1&amp;sp500_2==-1,]
    prob_up_down= sp500_mat[sp500_1==1&amp;sp500_2==-1,]
    prob_down_up = sp500_mat[sp500_1==-1&amp;sp500_2==1,]

    ##calculate avg returns
    mean(prob_double_up)
    mean(prob_double_down)
    mean(prob_up_down)
    mean(prob_down_up)"
2014-01-02 16:52:38,"Zero validity to your assumption re: conditional prob. Yesterday may easily have been priced before some huge news was released, donut is not a valid measure. 

If you have a model that will consistently score 51% of the time, factoring in losses,  you'll be wealthy. That is impossible unless you control the market,  are Jesus+1, or are a time traveler. "
2014-01-02 15:27:49,"I applied the code to the past 5203 trading days and found out that yes, the occurrence of a positive close given 2 previous negative closes is .556, while a positive close is .54, which I interpret as a very very small dependency. Is that wrong?


Regarding profitability:
Using the PG2N strategy, the average gain was +0.87, while average loss was -0.82, with winning occurrences being .556. Simply buying stock would have yielded 144%, while buy and hold yielded 221% (not including dividends). EV: +.119


Using Positive Given **3** Negative days strategy, average gain was .84, while average loss was -.875. But, the winning occurrences were much higher: .60. (288/480) That gives the strategy an expected value of +.15


Positive given **4** negative days happened much less. The signal hit 185 times out of 5203, and successes were 117. That gives the occurrence of .63, which had average an gain of +0.875% and average loss of -0.915%. The strategy has an expected value of +.12


Any thoughts on this? Can a strategy with lower average gains than losses, but higher chance of profitability be profitable in the long run?"
2014-01-02 12:48:06,"I appreciate the response. Like I mentioned, I'm not especially trying to find a profitable trade here, just trying to apply some Python knowledge. You bring up two great points. 


I think there can be a thoughtful discussion about the dependency of each event. Here's my take:


Every day, traders and investors are trying to gain insight about the market. Most of us have the same information about the economy. Most of us believe in corrections, dips, and general trends. If you are a smart investor or trader, and you see the market dip two days in a row *without news to back those movements,* you might think that there was a small correction, and that its a good time to buy. 


What I'm attempting to do is quantify how many days of losses it will take for the market to rebound. I'm probably thinking of this the wrong way--maybe there's no signal here. Reviewing the idea, it seems similar to gambler's fallacy.. if movement of the market is totally random, not guided by investor behavior. I'm still a student, so I appreciate you humoring me and discussing this."
2014-01-02 12:14:13,"Agreed with you on the concepts you present re: conditional probability and algo profitability.

Regarding the actual dependency of the SPY vs itself though, intuitively subsequent days are related (hence the existence of trends).  More quantitatively though we could just establish whether or not the SPY is auto-correlated.  If it is, then OP should be able to use his method.

Someone's done autocorrelation testing for the SPY to an extent here: http://www.mathestate.com/tools/Financial/r06/MarketData.html
"
2014-01-02 05:41:41,"First off, you can't use conditional probability in a situation where there is no dependency between events, ie today's probability of a positive close has no dependency on yesterday's result.   It's a misuse of probability. It's akin to flipping a coin ten times and using that result to predict what the next coin flip will be. It won't matter, the coin flip will still be 50/50 regardless of the previous flips. 

Second, 62.5% chance of profit isn't enough. You need to quantify the profits vs the losses as well. If there's a 62.5% chance of a $100 win but a 37.5% chance of a $300 loss then the algo will be net unprofitable. "
2014-01-02 05:34:12,"I'm a coder but I know nothing about trading so I'll answer the first two:

1. It really depends what format your data is in. You could read it from a CSV file with the Python `csv` module, or pull it from a database. Take a look at the `pandas` library, which might be overkill for your project but it's good to know that it's out there in future.

2:

- Instead of doing `i=0...while i&lt;40...i+1` it's a bit cleaner to just do `for i in xrange(40):`

- Use `len(dailyReturns)` instead of `40`, that way you can change the dailyReturns variable without breaking the rest of the program.

- It's a bit over-commented. Comments such as ""end while loop"" aren't very helpful (and if you feel the need to put that in, it probably means your block of code is too long to be readable). Unnecessary to put comments beside `posStreak = 0` etc in my opinion, since the variable is already explained when it's defined.

- Some things can be done outside of the while loop. e.g. `totalDays = len(dailyReturns)`, `SpyReturn = sum(dailyReturns)`

- The Python style guide is called PEP 8. The standard in Python is naming variables all lowercase with underscores (no camel-case). These things aren't so important for a small script, but you should be aware of it if you're ever working with other developers.

- Possible bugs: 
    - Cases are handled for the dailyReturn&gt;0 and &lt;0, what happens if it equals 0?
    - If there is a positive or negative streak on the last day, the program will crash because of the `i+1`

You have no control over anything, including CPU utilization, Network utilization, etc.  You may be physically close to a forex broker, but if someone else that is sharing the same physical system spikes their CPU, memory or network usage, your app could suffer from very hard-to-reproduce errors, and you could execute weird orders.  For example, your algo might set a limit order at the wrong price, etc, because of latency due to it being virtualized.

I would rather run on a home system with a regular DSL/Cable connection over a VPS, since I have 100% control over everything."
2013-01-07 18:14:00,"I'll try not to make this too self-serving, so as a preface - we are an NFA registered introducing forex broker in the US and one of our services is providing low latency VPS to clients - chances are if you trade enough we would cover your VPS (more info: http://bbfx.com/vps)

Regardless, I can tell you most of the FX brokers in the US are in one of the equinix DCs in and around NYC.  We use Commercial Network Services (http://www.commercialnetworkservices.com/VPS/Windows/Traders/) and Traders Colo (http://traderscolo.com/) - both designed for Forex traders in mind and both have locations in Equinix Datacenters, some are even cross-connected with brokers.

But that's only because Yahoo doesn't show you what happened to Lehman and other banks that went belly-up!

Yahoo also doesn't do that great at tracking ""corporate actions"" like stock splits, dividends, acquisitions, etc.  Look at [IAC/Expedia in 2008 on Yahoo](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=IACI%20Interactive#symbol=iaci;range=5y;compare=;indicator=;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) as an example.

2017-03-16 19:12:48,"Ok. So it's a weighted average because you are using machine learning to discover those weights. I thought you were weighting the sums of the two forecasts into a combined forecast and then throwing that into machine learning. For example, giving the 4 - 16 forecast 65% and the 64 - 256 forecast 35%. But that's not what you are doing.

Cool, I was planning on throwing each forecast normalized to -1to1 and the combined forecast normalized to -1to1 in my neural network as three more inputs to what I already have. Hoping to make some slight improvements to my accuracy. Currently getting a Sharpe Ratio of just under 0.9.

Yes, good advice on big trending markets. I'm working with a big futures market. Any of that horizontal stuff can kill a good trending strategy.

Thanks for the explanations!"
2017-03-16 18:42:20,"It's more like 1 to -1. So 1 would be strong buy, -1 would be strong short, and 0 would be no position. If you were doing long only, you'd do 0 to 1. 

When you add them together, you normalise the combined signal too, so you'll still end up in the range -1...1. 

Some signals are better than others. To find reasonable weights, you need to have a lot of data to backtest on, and use a statistical technique called bootstrapping, and finally an optimizer which will tell you what combination of weights works best. It's a lot of work and kind of pointless though- I can tell you that even splitting those indicators I gave you will produce reasonably good results.

One more thing about trend following. It tends to work better for big markets that trend (eg futures, currencies), and not so well for stocks, which tend to have sudden price shocks that this formula can't predict. "
2017-03-16 18:20:25,"Ah. Thanks. That makes more sense. Ok, so with the 0to1 normalized and then summed forecasts, you are left with a strongest buy signal at 2 and a strongest sell signal at 0...or the equivalent for whatever normalization one decides to use. Yeah?

What's the purpose of the weighted average you mention? Are you prioritizing one of the two forecasts over the other?"

Contrary to popular belief, HFT algorithms are much more vanilla than what most people make them out to be. There's nothing particularly interesting about entry/exit aside from the fact that holding periods are in the range of sub-seconds to seconds. This also means that it's inherently low risk; the only 'risk management tactics' you need are sanity checks to ensure your firm doesn't meet the same fate as Knight Capital. There's also risks that you need to account for, but can't do anything about, e.g. slippage.

2017-03-14 21:50:46,"Pair trading using Bollinger Bands just measures how much the pair has diverged from the norm (usually the 20 day moving average). There are lots of possible strategies because you can use many different moving average lengths and many different STD levels. You can also do things like only enter the pair trade after it passes the 2.0 STD level by a buffer amount (like .25) and then starts going back down again and hits the 2.0 level. This way you are trying to catch the pair while it is contracting.

As an alternative to Bollinger Bands, you can also do a type of intraday pair trading where instead of using STD, you start fresh each day and use the percentage the pair diverged since the market opened, instead of the Bollinger Band level. Like if the pair diverges more than .50% that day, you would enter the pair trade hoping the prices would converge back to normal by the end of the day. Or instead, you could base the divergence percent on the overnight move, and enter when the market opens."

&gt;
&gt;What skills do you want to improve that would gain you more customer business?
&gt;
&gt;Where do you get your customers? 

I use python, it's the best and fastest language for this purpose. 

I am not actively looking for customers they seem to find me as I am active in the algorithm trading local community. I just agree as a side gig, I already have the knowledge and it may help another person and it's a good way to make extra cash. 

I need to tune my parameters so I can have a low risk algorthim, once I do that I can find all kind of customers. In this kind of business word of mouth travel faster than anything else. Once you have generated reasonable returns to one customers they will come flocking.

I would like to emphasize that I don't design they algorthim what I get is a strategy and they require from me to automate it. I don't design algorthim at all for anyone else but myself, i just program and automate Thier own strategies.

Designing and selling algorthim is risky and hypocritical in my opinion. If you have a successful low risk algorthim you should use it yourself and run it. All the algorthim that's out there for sale don't work. Algorthim by themselves don't work. To make it work you need very deep knowledge in how it work so you can tune in parameters as needed . There is no easy way to make money without money, however some roads are less difficult than others.

The reason why people hate data science orachine learning or algorthim that it's not only require deep understanding of the subject, it requires you to tune in parameters. Sometime I had to run an algorthim for more than 1000 times just to tune a parameter or two, or solve part of it. for my news data mining script it took years of working on it optimizing it. It's fun but it requires grinding day out and day in just like anything else.

However the advantage of algorthim trading that once you hit gold, you will see gold. Plus you can do it anytime and anywhere. For me this mean I can work in my day job and work on it after work and the weekend, other side businesses takes time and managing and legal issues."

2017-03-14 02:06:37,"Answer: Myself.
Why?: Because my strategies work. Really. Well. Why give up the majority of the returns to investors when you can keep them all yourself? Truth/caveat: Limited scale in my strategies.

Been doing what I do for the past decade+ and make 7 figures a year doing it. Started with $10K a decade ago.

It's *much* harder now, and if I was entering the space today I probably couldn't make sufficient returns to start with &lt;$10K and turn it into millions again, but.... I didn't. I started a decade ago and it was crazy easier and I did. So now I'm established and here. IMO the real bullshit change is the cost of data. Nowadays if you want to access the best data to compete in the really cool spaces it costs $30-$150K/month just to get the data. Nobody can startup in an environment like that. Favors established players. IMO SEC should look at that.

My strategies don't scale well. I can't manage a 9 figure fund, as much as I'd like to (and have had offers to). So, I'm stuck making single digit millions algo trading. Is it bad? Hell no. Is it great? Also no. I want more, but thus far, haven't been able to hit that home run.

2017-03-14 01:03:31,how big are the moves? 
2017-03-14 00:53:31,"I believe this is right. Bollinger bands are just a measure of volatility. 

Kalman filters take a noisy stochastic process and filter it. One approach I believe is generate many (eg. 50) stochastic/GARCH forecasts, then filter the group using a Kalman filter into a single 'underlying' volatility model. Maybe someone will correct me. However, Bollinger bands use historical change meaning you could forecast future volatility for a forward looking indicator. Similarly, I think some traders use market implied volatility.

The alternative to volatility modeling is to improve the statistical fit. Standard deviations assume a normal distribution with i.i.d. variables, neither which capture random market prices. There are methods such as using autocorrelation to adjust the SD for a less-biased estimate. You might also be able to use a fatter tailed distribution. I would like to note the relationship between the SD and a z-score, which assumes ~N(0,1), but I can't help much with this area either.

If you are unfamiliar with cointegration, I would investigate there for pairs trading to see if it's something you like. Sometimes linear statistical relationships exist by lagging one of the pairs t-1 etc. If you are a die-hard technical trader, maybe investigate rate-of-change - which do not confuse with volatility."
2017-03-14 00:15:54,"Let me clarify.

Im creating a backtest using a python backtesting framework which requires OHLC data. I downloaded DukasCopy tick data.. which is presented in bid/ask/bid volume/ask volume. When I use pandas to create OHLC, it creates both ask OHLC and bid OHLC. So I first have to ""groupby"", but not sure which to use"
2017-03-14 00:06:47,"neither! you use trades/matches for OHLC, not book entries.  use the book when you want to attempt to calculate your execution prices"
2017-03-13 22:49:54,from what 
2017-03-13 20:10:36,"Could you be confusing quotes from trades? Trades work better for OHLC because it's easier to say 'someone else took that price, so I could have'. Quotes have less meaning since some use them as tools to ignite trading. 

If you trade small, then a simple mid price reflects 'no arbitrage' round trip transaction costs. To extend this, you could weigh the midprice with bid/ask size to account for supply and demand. You could even use the last price to measure distance to the bid/ask, but this requires using both quotes and trades.

If this for whatever reason is a particular concern, you might start with Roll's measure which adjusts for autocorrelation for the 'fundamental value' around the midprice. If you trade large enough, then OHLC using quotes does not reflect depth of the market, and impact-based models VWAP or TWAP may estimate cost better.

Since the bid/ask are two distinct prices for the same good, the law of one price begs the question of parity. In reality it's information risk, in an economic sense, which determines the limits of arbitrage. Instead of using a single price, which assumes completeness, you could always use a bid-ask matrix. I would just use the mid-price for simplicity's sake."

2018-01-31 18:22:58,Simple approach is to take local high/low (also called maxima/minima) over a fixed period e. g. 50 bars. Use school maths to find turning points (dy/dx =0). Use school maths again to find maxima or minima (d2y/dx). You then have a list of local min max values. If 2 or more have similar (introduce a variation factor to your price like 5% +/-) price you found a horizontal support. For non horizontal support lines project local min with other mins using linear function y=kx+m. Or try to fit many mins to the line using ols. The more mins from your list fit the stronger your support line

Ok, let's cool down everybody. OP might have been too harsh, but I agree with the main point he was trying to make, i.e. assuming that we can execute at the last traded price is very very different from a real market situation. Also, *everybody* that I know of who tried to implement LSTMs, CNNs or any other overly complex machine learning model to beat financial markets got his ass kicked in live environments. No matter what background they had, no matter how sophisticated their approach was, no matter how large their training set was... They all got wrecked. Everybody.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; There's no patterns in price actions. Therefore no technical analysts make money. 

It's not about whether there are patterns, but whether you can exploit them. It's possible that there are markets which follow specific patterns at certain times, while at the same time no known model is advanced enough to exploit these patterns. Financial markets are *extremely* complex and are often underestimated by researchers. I have seen that so many times over the years.

2018-01-30 01:07:00,"You're struggling because you're viewing your securities as no more than a ticker symbol with fluctuating prices. These securities represent something, many things. For example, SPY is a combination of all its constituents. It is a combination of the smaller sectors. You can find relationships between the security and the underlyers. ES is all that plus interest. Did you know that SPY is convertible into its underlyers and you can take a giant basket of the underlyers to convert into SPY? These relationships form the foundations for the hypothesis for you to test. You're not big enough or fast enough to do a strategy converting SPY baskets, but you definitely can do something like WMT and the products that they sell. WMT accounts for &gt; 30% of sales of many small companies' products. You could use one as a predictor of the performance of the other. The alpha that you can extract depends on the quality and novelty of this research. The complexity of the research determines how much competition you will run into when executing the strategy. Data like this is generally not readily available, or available in a low quality and quantity. You'll have to do some digging and automation. You can come up with strategies where the input data isn't even security prices.

You could pair SPY with any low risk asset, as the other asset is to be used as a 'risk-off' asset. This is basically a simpler form of two asset version of mean variance optimization (modern portfolio theory/markowitz).

As per the resources, I would recommend Quantopian tutorial and lecture series, and Wiki articles. As you test basic ideas you get a feel of what works and what doesn't, and you occasionally you run into algorithms on books, blogs, or Quant forums that are actually quite viable.

So there’s no mixing of GPL and proprietary code here. You’re thinking of `quantrocket` as one thing but it’s a mix of open source and proprietary components and those components are separate. As an analogy, Amazon’s [client library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) is open source (Apache 2.0) but the code that runs AWS itself is obviously proprietary. How Amazon or anyone else combines the AWS client library with other packages has no bearing on what Amazon does with their server-side code. 

Regarding installing backtrader in a Docker container, this is where mere aggregation applies. The Docker container contains all sorts of programs, including standard Linux programs, Python packages including the backtrader package (if the user installed it), and a binary containing proprietary QuantRocket code. The key point is that the proprietary binary never imports backtrader; it only knows how to forward commands from the end user to the OS (via the subprocess module). So if the end user forwards a command to run a backtrader script, the backtrader script will be run in its own process, not inside the binary. According to the GPL, programs that communicate in this way are separate programs, and the license of one has no bearing on the other. "
2018-01-29 13:12:22,"That was already explained in private. From your own documentation:


    import backtrader.feeds as btfeeds
    from quantrocket.history import download_history_file
    ...

That strikes me as your `quantrocket` module in the same program as the `backtrader` module ... but I may be completely wrong of course and that may be a case of *mere aggregation* or as you also mentioned in the past, *fair use*.

From your documentation again

    # docker-compose.yml
    services:
        ...
        satellite:
            image: 'quantrocket/satellite:latest'
            volumes_from:
                - codeload
            environment:
                PIP_INSTALL: 'backtrader&gt;=1.9'

Ooops ... the excuse here is ... we are not distributing ... but we are telling the world how to distribute a GPL package along with proprietary code. Of course without mentioning that anyone who publishes that `dockerfile` is bound by the terms of GPL, i.e.: bound to hand the source code. Who cares about informing about obligations.

It should suffice to prove that you are not respecting the GPL terms and that your understanding of the GPL is flawed.

And you draw people to confusion (like the poster above) because they will say: *quantrocket comes with backtrader*. And **NOT** they cannot be together. Thank you.

@mementix, I fear we’ve gotten off to a rocky start, but I’m very interested in exploring possible ways to work together, if you’re open to it!"
2018-01-29 08:58:56,"Hi there, I’m the main developer behind QuantRocket. 

I can see how there might be an appearance of GPL license infringement, not having a more detailed understanding of QuantRocket’s architecture. For this reason I’ve added a page to our website that provides detailed transparency about how the backtrader integration in the example docs works: 

https://www.quantrocket.com/opensource/gpl/

In a nutshell, as QuantRocket is a suite of loosely coupled microservices rather than a monolithic binary, QuantRocket and backtrader are ""merely aggregrated"" and are separate programs in the eyes of the GPL. 

@mementix, I hope you’ll review the linked article and I hope it clarifies that we’re fully respecting the terms of your license. I welcome your feedback."
2018-01-29 07:51:36,An example would be take the average of the past 20 days of a stock.  If it goes above that average then you sell.
2018-01-29 07:31:01,"**Mean reversion (finance)**

In finance, mean reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move to the average price over time.

Using mean reversion in stock price analysis involves both identifying the trading range for a stock and computing the average price using analytical techniques taking into account considerations such as earnings, etc.

When the current market price is less than the average price, the stock is considered attractive for purchase, with the expectation that the price will rise. When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall.

If a you're trading stocks and something you're watching jumps up 20%, and if you're using mean reversion, based on some other factors, you expect the stock to come back down to wherever its average is (revert to the mean).

Data: for many markets, daily equity data can be had from Google or yahoo finance.  There any also be other sites like quantiacs or quantopian or trade view that may help too. 

Testing: for back testing you will just need a spreadsheet with your price data, so it doesn't have to be online at all. For forwarding testing, you will need to be online during trading hours. 

Shortcuts: for equities, fundamental valuation / accounting / corporate finance tools are a must. Other than that, reading about how other traders trade can give you other ideas about how to trade. Lastly, delving into market theory and structure will be very useful. 

My experience: I got lucky in that I have a fairly deep understanding of markets, so my first go at algo trading was profitable but far from production-readying. In the time since, I've been refining my technique and should be production ready soon.  I don't make a living at algo trading yet but that's my goal for 2018.  

Do fundamentals matter: Absolutely.  However, their power lies in setting longer term asset prices. In the shortest terms, prices are mostly set by supply and demand.  Here your desired trading timescale will determine how much fundamentals matter to your strategy.  "
2018-01-29 06:51:45,"Sorry for being this late in getting back! Let's dive in!

Statistical arbitrage is a good methodology for trading, provided your markets are liquid enough for prices to correct in the direction of fundamental valuations. A decent example is the dow Jones (industrials) etf, DIA. The fundamental valuation of DIA is equal to the share price of each dow stock * it's respective weight in the dow. However, the supply / demand effects of trading mean that often DIA is under or over valued compared to Dow. Stat arbs would seek to trade the value difference away. 

Time scales: I meant that your desired trading frequency should be back tested against data at the same time scale. That is of you want to trade (1 buy or 1 sell) daily then you should be backtesting using daily data too. 

Assets: I suggested stocks because daily stock data is often free and the markets are liquid enough for all valuation theory to hold. Also stocks have a clearly understood intrinsic value which makes them easier to develop trading strategies for. Further, stocks are the underlying asset for many derivatives; so understanding stocks will help you understand and trade other assets later.  

Books:  a basic corporate finance textbook ( fundamentals of financial management by Brigham and houston)will get you started.  Also a basic accounting textbook(libby and libby)will help you get the hang of financial statements. Lastly, a book on valuation will tie everything together (business analysis and valuation by palepu, Healy, and bernard). 

Hope this helps, feel free to pm as well. "
2018-01-28 20:29:02,"Reinventing the wheel with a backtester: what purpose does this serve? Quantopian exists in python, xts/PerformanceAnalytics/quantstrat already exist in R, and they're just tools to let you implement your ideas, which you can implement in an excel spreadsheet (very painfully, albeit).

Blogs/websites: you really think someone's going to give away a good trading strategy completely for free on the internet? There is the occasional decent systematic trade written about on SeekingAlpha or whatnot, but even those systems depend on something like being able to trade mutual funds at the end of every month (not always possible), or at best, return 15% with a max drawdown of 17% or something. Far from spectacular, and far from anything that'll allow you to open up an asset management shop.

2019-04-16 15:22:52,"A lot of scammers in forex, indeed. Over at r/forex, we either are discussing scammers or calling out scammers among us. And plenty of shady stuff happening as well. [The flash crash in December last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-02/yen-surge-algos-set-off-flash-crash-moves-in-currency-market) was explained away by bots triggering trades during holidays, but r/forex was skeptical. With $3-5 trillion worth of transaction per day, a couple of banks/institutional investors can mess around with a few billions worth of insider trading.

That's why so much emphasis on risk management. I understand and agree that FX is not necessarily a reliable market. It's an open system, there is no regulation, and god knows how many shady transactions go unnoticed per day. But on the other hand:

1. That's why the insane leverage offered by brokers (although ESMA and other regulators are tightening those now). With proper Risk Management, you might lose small, but can win big. I can take a small position on 2:1 leverage, while my 500:1 leverage account assures me I can handle much wider swings in prices than for any other instrument.

2. In addition to that, as long as we are trading majors, almost zero spreads on ECN accounts, that are supposed to connect you directly to a liquidity provider. There is also no inherent ""bullish bias"" as in stocks: short-selling a currency is a legitimate and profitable approach. You also get paid for holding certain positions, through swaps alone.

3. The huge transaction volume is rather a plus in some ways, as it takes an insanely huge position and uncommon market conditions, to move prices out of whack. Before August, liquidity is abundant and regular TA holds well. Law of large numbers is better applicable to FX and volatility swings are usually confined around major news events or holidays. I am finding a simple MA strategy to hold well with FX trading, in backtest and real time.

It's entirely up to the individual, what they prefer. Some might like microeconomics, while others prefer macroeconomics. There is less degree of certainty with later, perhaps. Politics and mass hysteria can have a deeper impact than fundamentals. But I find that aspect of trading interesting too. I am still looking into analytical side for FX. ARIMA type models are present for FX trading too. But in future, I might try other instruments, once I get comfortable with them. If not spot FX, you can always go for regulated futures FX too. These days, [there are ETFs developed for FX too](https://www.thebalance.com/list-of-currency-etfs-and-etns-1215150), so plenty of ways to reduce risk in this volatile and massive market."

2019-04-16 12:58:28,"First of all, thanks for sharing. Code &amp; idea implementation sucks, but it might turn into a very interesting discussion! By admitting that your trade idea is far from being unique and brilliant, you make a super important step in learning. This forum needs more posts like that, and I encourage people to provide feedback!

Idea itself is decent, but your code does not implement it:

- You want to holds stocks that are going up, right? Well, imagine a stock above 100ma, 50ma, 20ma, but below 20ma and 10ma. It is just starting to turn down. According to your code, this stock is labeled as a 'rising stock', which is wrong. 

- SMAs are generally not cool. Not cool due to lag of 1/2 of MA period.

- Think of other ways to implement your idea of gauging ""going up stocks"". Try to define what is a ""stock that is going up"".

- Overbought/oversold part. This part is worse. You heard that ""RSI measures overbought/oversold"", so you plug it in. You have to define ""Overbought/oversold"" first, then check if RSI implements your __idea of overbought/oversold__ best, then include it.

- Since you did not define ""overbought / oversold"", and check whether RSI is good for it, you decided to throw a couple more indicators on top, just to be sure =) That is a bad idea. Mindlessly introducing more indicators does not improve your strategy, but it does greatly increase overfit.

- Labeling ""Sell / Neutral / Buy "" part. It is getting worse =)) How did you decide what thresholds to use for the labels? Why does ma_count and oscCount with a threshold of 0 is the best way to label? You are losing your initial idea! 
Just because 0 looks good, you decide that 0 is the best threshold. You have to do a research here. You'd be surprised by how counter intuitive the result might be, or how super unstable it might be=))

- Last but not least. Pls count the number of parameters. MAs, RSI, OSC, BBand + thresholds for RSI, OSC + Label thresholds ... I don't want to count, but I am sure it is well above 10 (maybe 15+?). Now even if you test at least 6-7 combinations of your parameters, your parameter space will be 10k+ of possible combinations. And that is just for a simple strategy.

- With 10k+ combinations on a daily data, I can overfit to a perfect straight line pnl. There is no way with so many degrees of freedom to tell if you overfit or not. Even on a 1min data!

The lesson is: idea first. Define it well. Then try to pick __minimal number__ of indicators (or functions) that implement it. Check for parameter space. If you have too many parameters, discard your idea, since you will not be able to tell if it is making/losing money because it has an edge or just purely by chance!

What is left out of this discussion: cross validation and picking best parameters going forward

2019-04-16 09:10:50,"You already have a great foundation. Most who start trading or are even remotely interested in it, don't appreciate the value of statistics in finance, of all professions.

1. The book [Forecasting by Makridakis](https://www.amazon.com/Forecasting-Applications-Spyros-G-Makridakis/dp/0471532339) is specifically focussed towards students of business/finance. It is quick and easy to read, and reaches to the meat of the subject (ARIMA stuff) pretty quickly (you can skip or quickly read through the introductory chapters). You can pdf version on scribd.

2. I go with Forex, EURUSD specifically simply because: huge volume (trillions worth transaction per day), some specific parameters to follow (interest rate, central bank mandate, gdp, inflation, purchase manager indices), a comparatively easier intuitive assessment (you can get an idea of investor sentiments by looking at the economic indicators/central bank statements). Whether it should be spot FX or futures FX is something to decide: people might prefer futures because there is a central exchange, more transparency.

3. You can get all the data you need by getting a MT4 platform from your choice of broker. You don't need to pay for it, or even have a live account. Just open a demo account and you will have access to historical data.

4. MT4 is the most widely used platform. You can write programs for it too (Expert Advisors execute tick-by-tick operations; there are scripts and custom indicators too). The programming language is MQL4, which has a syntax very similar to C/C++, so it's easy to adapt to it.

That is why no brokers bother to offer you a deal where they won't sell or use your data."
2019-04-15 21:39:57,"higher frequency trading means the fees accumulate faster, so you definitely need to figure out which direction you want to go.

Additionally the operational side of making a scalper bot that works from a retail setting is quite cumbersome. Doesn't sound like you have the time or interest to learn about this aspect, so maybe look at higher time resolutions.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also a lot of developmental work that goes into the creation **and validation** of a good ""bot"" (I prefer trading algorithm), but you are already trading.. But I would always recommend learning to build your own algo. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know ninjatrader8 has a strategy wizard function where non-coders can build algos pretty easily. The easiest programming language would be Easylanguage (tradestation/multicharts). You need to survey your options, and if you're going to drop money on something do your research first.

2020-05-01 00:49:13,"Ok. I thought about this. Don't start a firm until you can beat the market yourself. Not with code. With effort. The biggest mistake - in my experience - is people code in their own biases.  This is a product of the Dunning Kruger Effect. People who are intelligent and well educated especially tend to over estimate their understanding in areas not in their field. So really amazing developers will start writing code before they have read a filing. Before they understand trader psychology. Before they've ever walked into an investment bank, or a boutique. I read dozens of papers on learning models every month but not one of them has a thesis they are testing. They just try to figure out a way to make money.

Well, everyone is doing the same thing. So what about YOU gives your method an advantage? I can make one trade a year, and beat the S&amp;P. Without code. With code, I can beat the S&amp;P everyday. But, I couldn't do the latter if I couldn't do the former first.

And, (I thought of this while typing) call bullshit on yourself every day. Don't believe something is working that isn't. You need to be able to prove it to the devil before you believe it. If you can't beat the S&amp;P in live trading, then you need to accept you should just by the SPY.

And... if you can't beat the market when the market changes. You haven't beaten the market. You've just ridden it.

I actually do this actively. I set up accounts solely to test things.  Whenever I have an idea, I create an account, throw money in and test in realtime. Drives my partners nuts."

2020-04-30 20:44:50,"Predictive models have a major flaw: markets are chaotic. So instead of trying to predict price moves, instead we can infer a dynamical system from the order book action (the state space of order books in exponentially dimensioned, think along the lines of trace determinant plane). Then we have a dynamical system that is local to the most current order book, and is implicitly controlled by a meta dynamic system, that takes it from orderbook at time t to time t+1 to t+2 to ...

By this method, we dont predict anything, instead we reconstruct the system based on local data, which is completely empirical and anti predictive. Then we can use the local system to give a trade, or just the state of the market (is it high or low energy? Etc).

The chaotic ness of markets is why it looks so random. Its chaotic enough that it is almost, but not quite, a random process."

There's some interesting work on this exact topic that other researchers have done, specifically the decoding of unconscious or 'pre-conscious' decision making.  There's a long way to go before higher level executive functions like reasoning and decision making can be used in an applied manner though. Once Neuralink or something akin to it (deep, intracortical wiring planted inside your brain) becomes a thing in 20+ years or so, then that opens a lot of possibilities in this domain.

For now, if you wanted to model stock prices based on  visual system activation when someone is looking at stock prices, we can definitely already do that easily, but that might be the most roundabout and superfluous use of ML ever imagined haha."

Also, I'm a bit suspicious as to the applicability of RSI to volatility. RSI might have correlation to historical volatility but has anyone shown it's correlated to IV? 

Pretty much what I'm saying here is that it's more than likely that an effective IVR threshold will actually function as an effective signal for IV contraction so there's your directional signal."

Pick up Howard Bandy's book on Mean Reversion to get an idea what a strategy looks like and consist of.

Write your first backtest and test few ideas you heard about. See how they all fail. Use specialized software to test your ideas. Writing your own, generally, will lead you down a rabbit hole. 

Keep looking for more ideas, keep becoming better at testing them. You want to spend more time on ideas, less time on coding them.

Getting co-located should not matter to this, the difference is simply the bid/ask spread plus any broker front-running that exists.  (On a side note, I think I could statistically prove that my broker is front running me or not by comparing my actual fills to the average bid/ask spread throughout the day).

What the algo does now is pull the candle 3 seconds before the end of the minute, and place a market order, which usually fills right on or close to the close of the bar with my latency.  There is no 1 minute lag, the algo just calls the candle 3 seconds early.  This can lead to some small differences vs the backtest but I can live with that."
2021-05-16 12:21:50,"One minute is an eternity in terms of latency.  If you want to increase your market order fill rate relative to your alpha signal consider moving your time frame to a more granular setting.  

You can still use 1 minute or 5 minute signals, but for order execution you can refine your entry signals down as granular to 1 tick.  

Just about every retail data feed can get the feed down to 1 tick.  You will still have retail latency, but st least you won't be in the dark for an entire minute while HF moves the price 5 to 10 ticks."

Build it all as one app, with different options on entry for different purposes. 

Also I would suggest sticking to one language for the whole thing, to reduce complexity and because you will end up refactoring things numerous times, combining some things, splitting up others, and it will be easier to solve things once for a number of problems common to your project.

If you try to to do a micro services approach as an individual with limited system engineering experience, you will end up creating what is called a “distributed monolith” which has all the complexity and few of the benefits . Micro services are better when you have many teams working on many services at many different speeds of dev and many different risk appetites. 

Also,  spin up the whole thing locally, and run tests against it end to end is invaluable.

-It should not a hobby. Learning can be expensive. Supply chain software, market place software, analytics software, anything where problems can be solve with a bunch of equations. A demand/supply simple model for analyzing level 2 data can be used to maximize the lines at a grocery store. 

Do people sell them to companies, firms or people?
-Yes, all the time. Some go for $9.99 a month. Some are sold for millions and people have gone to jail for stealing code(Goldman vs. some dude)

do people backtest those strategies and manually trade with that strategy after they see positive feedback?
-A lot of work goes into it. Most researchers have Phds in maths or physics. Takes time and a lot of number crunching to find a working and scalable technology. Then you automate the process and test the fully developed system on a paper trading account. Humans are not reliable. Fully automated execution is important. 

do people backtest their algo and then let it trade on its own?
-Yes, some do. 


are you for or against making your own algo?
-For.

Are there special tools or requirements that you need that most people cant get ahold of? Ex: information, or technology
-Many, many."

If so, please, I beg you, use an existing trading engine like Lean (i.e. QuantConnect), HummingBot, or similar. Study their source code too. Save yourself years of development work. If you were building a website, would you try to re-invent Rails, Django, or React?

On the other hand, if you're interested in building an engine for another reason, that's fun! A lot of what you and others have mentioned is very true. Stay away from micro-services for now. YAGNI and they will slow you down.

I'm more than a little confused by your distinction of micro-services and ""de-coupling"". Micro-services *are* decoupling, to the most extreme extent.

The database will of course be run as a separate process from your main app.

The rest of your ""services"" can just be confined in a single monolithic web server. REST/WS/LogicEngine/TradeExecuter etc .. they can just be one program. Once you study the source of existing engines, it will make more sense. Then once you realize what the limitations are, you can engage in more fancy architectures to scale out.

2. the crappy ones are sold on fiverr, made into youtube videos, and shilled to the masses...i've never heard of companies buying algos but it could land you a job at a fintech company.
3. up to the individual, some don't even backtest or have a shitty way of backtesting.
4. depends on the algo, if your strategy is a EMA crossover don't reinvent the wheel, same with grid bots, dca, etc.  If your strategy involves something unique you have to build it yourself.
5. not really, most information is already out there...getting proper data streams and cleaning them can be challenging in real time, some pay for good data. post processing data or doing ML on it in realtime can be GPU intensive which requires good hardware."

OP should check out *Quantitative Trading* by Earnest Chan. I think it's too expensive for what you are getting, but it's a a comprehensive overview of how you should go about constructing one of these systems. It's good, Chan obviously knows his stuff! I just think there might be better books for the money and first quant book.

Sure; you raise a valid point that a good backtest isn't a guarantee for a good live performance. But that aside; it's a process that allows you develop your strategy and effectively see what your changes actually do. 

It's very much possible to take components like commission and slippage into account. 

It really helps if you have a coding-background, or willing to learn howto code. You could start with learning Pinescript and test via TradingView. 

Hope this helps, I can't stress enough the importance of backtesting your strategies.
