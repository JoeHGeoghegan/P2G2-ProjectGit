2015-02-12 15:12:10,"&gt; There's also the issue of winding down a company that has been an important part of the housing industry for around 80 years, having to replace Fannie seems like a nightmare of a process

This is what sticks for me more than anything. Reform makes much more sense than winding down the entities. The pre-existing infrastructure worked well enough to rebound quickly from an extreme tail event in the housing market. Higher capital requirements? Fine. But completely trashing the entities only to remake and rebrand some Fannie and Freddie 2.0 under another name seems extremely costly and pointless. Then there is the issue that the governments prerogative is supposedly to bring more ""private capital"" into the picture in order to spare the tax payers from risk - well it's private capital they would be screwing by winding down Fannie and Freddie. The same private capital they are trying to attract...

It's been interesting to see the housing market in the US seemingly lag all other economic indicators, and I wonder how much of this is tied to the current mortgage market and thus tied to Fannie and Freddie."
2015-02-12 15:11:51,"We're approaching 7 years since the 2008 meltdown. If they were going to be ""wound down,"" it would've at least started by now. They ain't going nowhere."
2015-02-12 14:48:28,"I also speculative position in the company. If Fannie was currently losing money and had cost the tax payers even more money we would be hearing plenty about it, feel good stories about bailed out companies aren't exactly popular. There's also plenty of legal entanglements and most people just don't care about illegal sweeps and takings of private property if it doesn't involve their own property.

It does set a pretty bad precedent if the government keeps the sweep going. There's also the issue of winding down a company that has been an important part of the housing industry for around 80 years, having to replace Fannie seems like a nightmare of a process. Judge Sweeney recently threw out the case to stay the discovery process which well help in getting more documents from the Treasury regarding what actually went down."

2015-02-12 13:33:28,"Long on Fannie. Would be interested to hear what others in this sub think of the situation. Obviously I'm biased, but I feel like GSE reform is integral to the US housing market and that guaranteeing loans is a natural monopoly due to the economies of scale in such a business. Albeit complex, I'm surprised this story doesn't get more media coverage seeing as Fannie and Freddie are now extremely profitable and have returned all of the bail out money to the treasury. I thought more people, especially anyone who invests in publicly traded companies, would be up in arms about the fact that the US Treasury is sweeping all of the profits from these entities that are still trading publicly. Scary precedent if it continues."

One tenet of prudent portfolio management is the consideration of taxation (such as harvesting losses).
2015-02-10 19:09:29,Would you like to rephrase your meandering post into one coherent thought?
2015-02-10 18:36:20,"That's the thing though -- you have to evaluate the fund. The classic example is BRK because it's the most well-known, but really there are a large handful of people taught by Ben Graham who can consistently return 15% or more per annum (ben graham and warren buffet had a track record of 20% per annum, warren buffet has a speech where he mentions a handful of other people. it's the monkey coin flipping speech). Also, I personally feel that you'd have to go back to the 90s or earlier to get a real view of these. If you look since 01 or 02 of course its feasible to have better returns on growth funds, that doesn't really cover the full economic cycle. 

It's good that you're questioning the long term results and fees -- honestly I wouldn't expect a very large fund to be able to outperform by a significant margin unless it had buffet or his successors at the helm. Also take a look at SCHD, it's only been around since '11 so obviously we can't look in the past for it, but I think the criteria for selection allow a quality bias, so if you want to follow it in the future see if it outperforms the next bear market"

2015-02-10 09:40:41,"I am not saying time the market.  I am saying the opposite. I am saying that the funds that I looked at here were outpaced by S&amp;P total index when looking at a 10-20 year time horizon. My point about if you knew it was a bear market is that it is difficult to do, and if you somehow magically knew that a bear market was coming, which I would argue most people cannot know for sure as we saw in 2014 and 2013 with naysayers sitting out on huge gains, then the logical decision wouldn't be invest in a value fund that performs less bad than the whole index. 

Your point about buying a dollar for 80 cents is good. And I inderstand that is the value philosophy, but with the funds I looked at, which granted is not all of them listed here, I saw clear better returns from including the growth stocks from S&amp;P in a total index fund rather than a fund that a manager feels represents value. 

to be clear, I am not advocating timing the market in any way shape or form, just questioning the long term results from the value funds I had looked up e.g. Wintergreen.

It would be hard to argue that the analysts whose sole purpose was to evaluate the risk of mbs tranches weren't negligent when not even considering the possibility of a down turn in the real estate market. They only accounted for prepayment risk when applying a rating. You could say it would take a black swan event to cause real estate values to decline, but really? We really thought it was impossible for a market to decline in value? 

It wasn't negligent for the people whose purpose was to evaluate risk not to consider a down turn on their market ever to occur? I would say it was, and if we punish based on consequence rather than action, it makes sense that the hammer came down.

2015-02-09 16:51:17,"I can't say if there are actual contractual obligations in place but in many cases I think it is classic human psychology at play. Most managers are more than happy to keep up with the status quo if it means they keep growing their asset base and earning their fees, if you're getting a 2% management fee on 10 billion AUM, why risk your annual 200 million pay-check by going into Russia.

The other important thing is that most funds don't really have permanent capital in place so the spectre of redemptions is always hanging over them. If you're managing money from a particular pension and you're down 10% in year due to investing in Russia then some of your clients are going to be pulling their money. It's why only few big investors like Klarman can afford to get involved in places like Russia, he knows he won't have clients pulling their money out of the firm even after a down year or two.

I also wouldn't be surprised if some institutions like CalPERS have enough clout to tell anyone with their money not to get into some regions."
2015-02-09 16:17:31,I am unfamiliar with AM.  Are institutions too timid to invest in Russia or are their hands tied by politics and policy?  Do the big investment firms have an explicit contactual obligation not to invest in certain countries (eg: European EM except for country A and B)?
2015-02-09 16:03:09,"Definitely more of the latter, I haven't come upon any Russian centric funds today but I will hear from small value managers here and there who are looking through Russia. Small shops have more leeway in where to invest and are more active in Russia than big firms that have institutional money."

That means wallmart collected that much more per quarter, if you have acess to a balance sheet you can see the actual number for profits. Now, compare that to Amazons: http://www.estimize.com/amzn , This is a very old school way to replicate massive growth. They spend every penny they earn right back into the company, instead of saving. The Rockefellers did this in the late 1800s, famously telling their business partners and wives not to live lavishly. This helped them buy out many Oil wells that failed during the depression of the 1880s, and even removed their reliance from the banking system of getting loans for expansion (of course they had to be broken up by the government later, as they practically had a monopoly, but that is of other issue).

The fact that bucket 3 goes to 0 securities doesn't bode well for the methodology.  

Why not show the performance of each score? 9 total.   Or create 3 buckets of 3?

2014-01-30 18:48:51,"From the top of my head, amazons net margin was ridiculously low like 1-5%. When i was studying economics in college, i recall studying markets and information. Amazon gives consumers near perfect information for homogenous goods coupled with increased utility of no travel and convenience. 

Could amazon potentially corner the market and play a strategy of lowest prices period, forcing competitors out of the market, then raise prices with no competition, and once competition comes back in search for profit, reduce prices back to their lowest? Thus big one time short term gains and long instances of near 0% profit.

The inputs are very subjective, so going through the whole exercise is likely pointless. I like Buffett's thoughts on analysis: focus on qualitative aspects of the company, then get an idea of owner's earnings under normal business conditions."
2014-01-30 18:28:38,"Banks and insurers are opposite in a sense.

In a bank, you know what your liabilities are, but you don't know what your assets are worth. If the people you lent to can't repay the loans you have, then the assets aren't any good.

In an insurer, you can have a decent idea on your assets, but you don't know what your liabilities are exactly, because they're composed of reserves that haven't paid out.

Genworth and Symetra seem to be involved in life insurance and mortgage insurance (Genworth specifically).

As you may have seen with insurers, they tend to blow up. AIG, Tower Group, Meadowbrook (There are some pockets of good here... just poor influence), MBIA, Conseco, etc. are all recent examples, but it's happened many times before them all too. 

Instead of focusing on making a return, let's think about how to blow up an insurer:

1. Underprice your products - if you sell below cost, even Buffett's ability to generate returns won't be helpful. Tower group is a good example.

2. Expose yourself to significant man made disasters (especially when they're not well understood) - Asbestos, terrorism, financial market insurance, etc. If you write insurance on mortgages (this is typically for people who can't pay 20% down for a home), and home prices fall enough, what do you do? If you're fannie and freddie, you don't slack off on credit guidelines, and you do everything possible to avoid default. If you insure mortgages and they were slacking off, then when home prices fall, your insurers will be subject to them. These are all ""man made"" because it wasn't the result of something more natural like a hurricane. In some cases, I will invest in a financial insurers, but not frequently.

3. Make bad investments - if you invest your premiums horribly, then that can ruin the firm.

That's just a list of 3 things that came to my mind right away, but insurance is filled with 50 more things to do. It's an extremely sensitive business in my opinion and can be ruined with a bad CEO. For example, compare it to Coca Cola. Even if the CEO of Coca Cola does something dumb, the business is likely to print billions of dollars in profit. If you get an idiot at a bank, well, you've already seen this one... their shareholders go to 0. If you get an idiot at an insurer, the outcome isn't *too* different.

I'm happy to invest in insurers, but there are a lot of risks that need to be looked at to understand it well. I hope I don't come off as someone who says to avoid insurance... I just recommend caution. When the Japanese earthquake/tsunami struck, I was actively making many purchases, and was able to buy into a wonderful insurer run by a CEO who truly ""gets it."" It's a firm where maximizing shareholder value is actually what they do and not just what they say. Long story short, it's a really interesting industry to study, but just be cautious about what type of business you're purchasing.

Sort all business from stable to unstable. And begin with the most stable.
Office produces constantly growing earnings so you can value it via Terminal Value: TV = earnings * 1 / (R - G) ; R is rent, which is always 15% or higher, my personal investment hurdle. G is growth, which is the average, median, minimum growth over the last 5-10 years. 
Sum TV of the business less Liabilities together till you get market cap. Than you have an idea whats free.

What are the model assumptions: 

TV and Growth: TV is highly unstable, because it discounts cash flows from infinity. Therefore do not play around with R and use high R, which is your PERSONAL interest rate before you make an investment (no risk adjustment here, adjustments should be in the earnings imho). You can play around with G. This helps to identify what growth the market or you should demand before making an investment. Compare G with your common sense and the quality of business - you need to understanding the economics of that business!

Order of the business stability: This is very subjective. Its easier to order business A before B before C, than to quantify the quality. You should change the order and see whats happening.

Try to kill the company: Play around with the G and TV to kill the company. Get a sense for things that can kill your thesis.

Do not use it to value, but to test your assumptions on the business. Play around! Get a feeling what matters? What has to happen before a total loss of capital? What is already priced in? What is the upside/downside? How likely is it? 

I invest when my upside is substanitally higher than my downside. Thats all. Simple but not easy."

You're discounting things from the future.  Almost by definition, future things are unknowable now.  You can find unknowable things that tend to realize consistent values .. like a money market fund, but you know the deal there.

In my worthless opinion, the beauty of a DCF is not in its accuracy but in its flexibility.  You can really assign a value to anything.  The process of assigning that value (if you don't have an ulterior motive) should at least make you very aware of what you require in the future for your valuation to hold."

""the real flaw of the DCF model is the assumption"": I agree. DCF has correct math but in practice flawd assumptions.
Prof. Greenwald of Columbia uses an approach based on the reliablity of the companies assets (incl. non accountable assets like brands &amp; competitive advatages). http://www.scribd.com/doc/15987706/Greenwald-Earnings-Power-Value-EPV-lecture-slides

I use a similar approach and try to rebuild a company earnings statement to see which business part I get for free. I like free parts which have high upside but have very unreliable cash flows (new product launch, restructuring). The markets tend to be very bad in assessing the probabilities and sucess/fail payouts. 
This approach works similar with business parts which drag the performance of the overall company. The market discount might be higher than negative value of the business part (liquidation value of that part).

Last but not least, valuation is never precise. If you have a single number with decimal places, its very likely wrong. I have always value ranges!

2014-01-30 12:34:17,"&lt;this is something I wrote awhile back. Would appreciate your thoughts. please try to be as detailed as possible in your analysis; I would be eternally grateful if nobody pointed out a fault for the sake of pointing it out.&gt;

For the benefit of those not in the know, the DCF method is the most important formula known to the modern investing world in the investment decision. It involves extrapolating the future earnings of the business from its current performance, hence deriving the value of the company, or the maximum one would pay to buy its shares. The way it works is like by reverse-engineering this straightforward formula:

e/p = r

Where p is the price it’s worth, r is the rate of return and e are its earnings. Let’s say you have a dishwasher which costs you $100. If you buy the dishwasher and it saves you an hour a day washing dishes, you could theoretically turn around and invest that hour into something productive, like freelance programming or article writing. If you can get $10 per hour from that side activity which you would have otherwise spent washing dishes, you can say that you’ve earned a 10% return per day on your initial investment.

e/r = p

The way DCF works is it reverse-engineers the formula (as above) to try and predict what the future price of the company is worth. Let’s say that by looking at the past earnings of the last 10 years, one forecasts it will reliably carry on producing stable cash flows for the next 10 years, thus giving us the ‘e’. Then, by accounting for certain key risks factors, one predicts the expected rate of return, thus giving us the ’r’. By dividing the two (of course it’s not that simple, I’m just summarizing it), you can forecast a future ‘p’ of the company, and by dividing ‘p’ by the number of shares you can find out the maximum price you’d be willing to pay for each share.

On paper, this seems like a brilliant way to predict the correct share price to buy a share at. However, this formula has a number of issues. Firstly, it is far too simplistic to assume with confidence that a company’s earnings will remain stable for an indefinite amount of time. Too many companies, even untouchable juggernauts the likes of Microsoft, Washington Post and Lehman Brothers, have demonstrated that even the safest of havens can be upset by new developments. Surely there are some whose cash flows have endured, such as the ever recognisable Coca-Cola and insurance giant Geico, but statistically speaking no large company can be considered ‘assuredly safe’ from the ravages of time.

Secondly, the employ of determining ‘e’ is fraught with perils and uncertainties. Let me give you the most drastic example, the valuing of what’s known as real options. Real options represent the potential earnings a company might derive from some asset it currently holds but does not yield positive cash flows from. For instance, let’s say JCP is currently having negative cash flows, but owns a piece of empty land next to it. In arriving at future earnings, you can’t say that the land is completely stagnant because it might be utilized in the future, for example by building an extension to the shopping mall or a new hotel. The valuing of real options employs the Black-Scholes model used to value options and warrants to extrapolate the future earnings of an unused piece of land. Keep in mind that the land is not being used at all, with no future plans to use it; and we are assuming that a model used to value static systems like options can be extrapolated to a dynamic situation like an unused piece of land. A flood could come tomorrow and render it forever condemned for commercial purposes. Even so, the use of real options in valuing a piece of unused property can sometimes exceed the current value of the said property itself! Let’s just put it this way, if I were a billionaire and you presented me with a price for JCP, I would definitely want to know whether you included real options in your valuation.

Lastly, the derivation of future ‘r’ is also no small task. The current method extrapolates the current debt and equity values to provide an appropriate risk profile to determine a reliable rate of return into the future, however what’s to say that the current risks will remain the same 20 years into the future? Look at the history of any newspaper company and you’ll realize how fragile even the largest companies can be. The remedy for that is to provide a range of different ‘r’s to accommodate the possibility of things going awry, however if your company goes bankrupt or loses half its earnings potential, a range isn’t going to be very helpful for your investment.

However, I’m not discounting the DCF method entirely. I’m not trying to villainize it as an impractical formula which has lost its utility in the modern world. I’m simply saying that, given its widespread acceptance and the trust millions of investors place in it, perhaps it deserves a second look. The fact that Warren Buffett did not use it in his younger days, (Alice Schroeder uses the phrase ""decades and decades"") lends credence to the possibility that it may not be all that it appears to be. As someone who has done numerous DCF calculations in the past, I have my doubts on its reliability, especially on small and medium sized companies.

The DCF method is far from being the only culprit in the ‘its-not-perfect-but-its-the-best-we-have’ camp which is unquestionably relied on in the broad finance industry. With a disposable amount of capital this might not be such a big deal, but when the livelihoods of families and entire economies around the world at stake, maybe we should give it a closer look.

If there are high ROI investment opportunities  available to the company (i.e. unavailable to you as an individual investor) that earn more than the company's cost of capital, you want the company to put it back into work. If you don't think there are or you don't trust management to execute on them, you'll want the money back. This is why you see high profile activist investors frequently agitating the Board to return cash to shareholders and why dividend and buybacks are generally looked upon as shareholder-friendly moves.

A lot of the time management of mature companies will hoard cash and look for ways to spend it (acquisitions, new products, developing things, etc.) as a way of justifying their paycheck and job title. Sometimes these are good investments, many times they're not.

apple posted a great link that pretty much covers it. A share repurchase is essentially the company investing its cash in itself. It's essentially the company saying it will earn an ROI higher than its cost of capital by investing in the company, as if it were making any other kind of investment.

Before sending cash back to investors, Baupost nearly passed the $30 billion AUM mark this year, compared to just $27 million in 1982, and during that time Klarman has always made a point of focusing on long-term value creation. Sometimes that means holding onto cash so that he could seize opportunities as they arose.

“To assume the investment opportunity sets that are available to you today are as good (or better) than those that will present themselves next week, next month, next quarter is naive and you need to have cash to take advantage of those new investment opportunity sets,” said Klarman, according to Raymond James chief investment strategist Jeffrey D. Saut, who attended Klarman’s talk at the Grant’s Investment Conference.

So having cash on hand was not, by itself, a major problem. But Baupost had $14 billion in cash as of late October 2013, nearly half of its total portfolio, and Klarman didn’t expect to find enough interesting investment opportunities to put that money to work. "

2014-01-27 10:45:51,"The rule of thumb is to use all of the explicit cash flows and then use a terminal value.

If it is a company that you believe will have a perpetual existence (an assumption that is made in pretty much every case except for liquidations or some special situations), you should also include a terminal value beyond the explicit forecast period.  So if you explicitly forecast 10 years of cash flows, you should then have a terminal value (using a growing perpetuity formula) in the final period and then discount that back to the present as well.  Sometimes you will also see people use an ""exit multiple"" of EBITDA, earnings, or cash flow instead of a growing perpetuity, but I think that is more common in private market valuation.  Add all of the cash flows up and that is the total value you estimated for your security.

You should also be sure that you are discounting the proper cash flow claims though.  For instance, if you are trying to value the equity of a company you need to make sure that you are using 

* 1) the appropriate discount rate for equity (not the firm), and 
* 2) the appropriate cash flows for equity (after subtracting interest payments, preferred dividends, and any other claims that have higher priority than equity)

2014-01-26 22:23:52,"...If you discount for long enough the incremental value of the cash flow should become fairly meaningless. 
For example, discounting at 10% (.9^15 = .205), cash flow 15 years from now is worth 1/5 of what cash flow is worth now...

More telling might be a terminal value calculation. A business generating $1 infinitely at a 10% discount rate should be worth $10 right?(terminal value of infinite geometric series), but we can see that the cash 15 years from now is worth $0.2...so Y15 is only 2% of the whole intrinsic value calculation...in fact Y10 is only worth 3.4% of the whole intrinsic value and 

.9^10 + .9^11 + .9^12 + .9^13 + .9^14 + .9^15( years 10 through 15) is just worth 16% of the total value of the company....so you never have to draw the line, MOST of the value of a company in the present comes from value IN the 1st 10 years

To prove my point, 1 + .9^1 + .9^2 + .9^3 + .9^4 (the first 5 years)=40% OF THE COMPANY!

The hardest part of discounted cash flow isn't actually the # of years(always discount infinitely forwards if the business is a going concern), it's projecting the cash flows that far out...how are you supposed to predict the future cash flows in year 15? THAT's the challenge.

Goodluck!"

Discount rate is essentially the investor's opportunity cost of capital. Let's say there's another orange tree with 2 harvests left, each $20, on sale for $33.80. Now, if you use the formulas you talked about, this comes out to an annual return (IRR) of 12%.

This means that in our investment universe (2 investments, lemon tree and orange tree), the opportunity cost of capital is 12%. If we buy the lemon tree, we're leaving a guaranteed return of 12% on the table.

Now, in this case we'd use 12% as our discount rate. After calculating the PV of all future cash flows at 12%, what is this tree worth to me? If it's below the asking price, it's a good deal. If it's above, then it is not for *me and my investment requirements*.

It can also be a measure of risk. I'm an investor whose required return for purchasing sapling lemon trees is 15%. There's more risk in buying saplings. You have to feed them, nurture them until they become trees that yield fruit. Storms or bugs could kill them. My required return for buying adult trees is 8%. Why? They're already bearing fruit, I can predict my cash flows with more certainty. Thus, I require a lower IRR on my investment."

2014-01-24 21:49:01,"Yes, you're correct.  Margins are probably better in tires on average, actually.  But tires, themselves have little differentiation and could be considered almost commodities themselves.  Whereas, cars have quite a bit of differentiation and name-brand recognition, a moat, if you will.  

The tire industry has been consolidating in recent history and I think it will eventually turn into an oligopoly type business, in which business and multiples would increase.  Could be a good place to park some money for the long haul.  Especially as it appears that it's one of the few ""cheap"" industries left."

2014-01-24 09:23:01,"The rubber and tire industry is low multiple because it has low margins, high capital intensity, unions, pensions and a lot of commodity risk.  Frankly, I don't think it's a really attractive industry.  Look at Cooper Tires.  They had a buyout offer on the table from Apollo Tyres from India (an LBO by Apollo Group) and the unions in the US and China stuck a knife through it.  Enter lawyers and advisors -&gt; fees and distractions.

Yes, tires aren't going anywhere soon, but these companies have a lot of baggage and low margins.  They're just not all that attractive when compared to other industries."
2014-01-24 09:11:13,"Rubber and tires would probably have a fairly low debt actually. 
Taken off Investopedia...""Enterprise value is calculated as market cap plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents"". So a low ratio isn't necessarily bad, its just saying how much you would pay for a company per its earnings before tax. 

Since the EV/EBIT ratio is so low, either the ev is low or the EBIT is high. Since rubber is a commidity, I would imagine most companies use their cash to hedge the cost. Since you subtract cash from EV, that would lower the multiple. I would also imagine that the demand for tires is relatively stable, so there isn't as much need to use leverage to build a new plant, as you might for a car/airplane company. Finally, if the revenue is relatively stable, then it make sense to have a lower EV/EBIT since you know that there aren't going to be any real increases in demand. You wouldn't want to pay 20 times the earnings if the compay's revenues are going to remain the same year over year versus a finance company that could potentially have a much higher upside

BUT, I also read a very interesting article about China's ghost cities. The govt is building them with the intention of migrating their rural population en masse to city life. Then, they're going to industrialize agriculture like the US--boom, DE wins.

It's not the poor countries that are fueling DEs growth--it's the BRIC. They will certainly use seeds, but these are large players with large capital resources, and potentially government encouragement in the biggest market (China), and they will certainly be buying shit tons of tractors.

I think I'm right that the seeds will impact the industry, especially in poorer places, but I'm beginning to think that this won't translate to John Deeres suffering. They don't depend on those countries, nor does their growth plan involve them. Their growth plan is BRIC. China is obv the strongest argument--China's govt isn't like the USA govt..they say jump, you say how high? If they want to urbanize their population, and industrialize their agriculture, it will happen. And Deere will have a market 4x the size of the US to expand into. A market that also had a much higher population density than the US, and thus a greater need for improved yield

2013-01-14 01:56:04,"Yeah, that's interesting how preferred markets work in Australia.  It would be very very interesting if Australia went through a recession within 1-2 years after funding for those companies did indeed dry up. Security Analysis may have parts that are  outdated, so it'd be interesting if Graham's observation that Preferred and Convertibles only come up near a recession/sector collapse due to general lack of funding still held weight.

What struck me with convertible debt is that it's great if you own it, but it's a huge annoyance if you only own stock in the company. In pretty much every case, the new bondholder gets ahead at the expense of the current shareholder. So I guess I wasn't very clear.

Looking at some scenarios:

If the company goes bankrupt, the stock is most likely worthless, but the bonds will be more likely to get some money back in time due to seniority over equity and preferred. Some money is better than none here.

If the stock price and dividend increases greatly beyond the return of the bond, The bondholders will convert their bonds and dilute the shareholders. Technically this might just balance out a share's value considering that the bonds no longer have to be paid, but that's probably too complex an issue for a single post.

If the stock just drops a lot without a credit event, the bondholder will probably keep his bonds and have a much smaller loss on his hands, considering that he also gets interest. Meanwhile the stockholders have to keep their loss and maybe dividends."
2013-01-14 01:27:54,"Australian here, our market is ""saturated"" by banks and other large institutions issuing hybrids/retail bonds, you name it. The reason being:

a - a lot cheaper way to borrow (they pay BBSW+ 3 to 4.5%, BBSW is the LIBOR alternative in Australia) - this works out to between 6-8%

b - a lot of capital available vs European or US markets which are rather dry, or available at 10-16%

Whilst ""technically"" pref/hybrids could be considered ""toxic"", the real underlying reason should be sought after. Some companies may be pulling debt out to take over other companies, or chase growth etc. Some may be restructuring some debt, etc. The interest rate generally gives you an indication of risk along side with demand."

2013-01-07 23:48:15,"There seems to be two opinions concerning what to do with a poorly run company

1. Sell, because it's unlikely you can replace/undermine current management, and even if you do it'll be a long road to recovery at least several years long. Furthermore, selling might attract managements' attention and force them to change.

2. As the part owner of a business, it is your right/responsibility to vote according to your best interests. If the business does poorly due to operating failures, you should actively attempt to replace the management, even if you have to wait several years for new profits to appear.

I don't think there's any correct answer to the question of corporate voting. Phillip Fisher advised people to pursue 1) since he was a growth investor. Any time waiting for growth by replacing management was therefore time and capital wasted. Graham invested for value, and thought you could often try 2) when the business was sound but management or finance was not. Then the activist investor could ""unlock"" the potential of the company from the balance sheet by issuing dividends, initiating stock buybacks. Fisher was a long term ""ten bagger"" investor, while Graham preferred medium term buying at a discount and selling at a premium. I suppose their policies regarding voting reflected this."

Well they can be cash flow positive for a few years till bust by Feds, who might not been able put the pieces together so with the case spelled out for them they may pursue them now. 

I want to see what valuation he puts it at, and his support. 

However I do think Ackman is too aggressive with a target price of $0. I had put value at $33.50 as of last week given different scenarios including bust by Feds, fined by Feds, tweaked business model to be more MLM less pyramid scheme and status quo. Even though it was in the $20-ies at the time, I wouldn't go long because a margin of safety is useless without certainty of downside. Since my scenarios are so vastly different, there was no certainty.


Edit: I forgot to mention that BP was a great hold your nose and buy it stock post oil spill. I don't remember my valuation, but you could take the worst oil spill prior in terms of cost and double it then spread it out a few years (front load costs of course) and the valuation was so high above what the market it was. BP was fine in terms of cash flow. With a worst reasonable case saying its undervalued, I'm in."

With fossil fuels, the profit is the price of electricity minus the cost of the fuel. These profits are regulated by law.

With solar, the profit is price of electricity minus (capital cost + maintenance). But with a high enough capital cost (billions), the barrier of entry becomes high enough that only a few people can take advantage of any potential long term cost advantage. 

But once the initial capital costs are paid for, solar generators become (and stay) a low-cost provider. If fuel costs go up and electricity prices go up, the solar guys will simply increase their cost advantage.

The same principle works with hydro-electricity, but there are small in number, and can't grow (can't build more dams). And if one believes that CO2 emissions will be regulated (additional tax, or some trading scheme) in a decade time, then solar is even more attractive. 

In one sense owning a solar farm is much like owning a regular farm--fixed initial capital costs that generate income for many decades to come. And demand for energy is always increasing."

There's a good reason for that. He wants as many people as possible, to pick up this book and enjoy it. More than anything, it is Lewis's talent in explaining mind-numbingly complex transactions about synthetic credit derivatives (which were at the center of the frenzied bubble maelstrom) into a step-by-step common sense driven decisions that his readers could understand.

Regarding Dr. Burry - I've read more about Dr. Burry than probably anyone else about has (his posts on SI &amp; VIC, books, annual letters, lectures, articles) I feel that he's ***the most underrated investor of our time***. As someone who never had a formal education in investing, he studied and built his own strategy from the ground up and only relied on informed common sense to guide his judgement. 

He made $100 million betting against a subprime bubble which - in my opinion - grossly undervalues his talent and hard work. He deserves a lot more; I wouldn't be surprised to see his name in Forbes 400 list in the future."

2016-03-01 13:36:00,"Thanks, its been interesting and I have enjoyed it! I would be interested to see your AMA. 

1) There can be conflits between the two, but the way we utilize it there are a lot of synergies. When it comes to stock selection, we are first and foremost a fundamental shop. None of our picks are the result of screens. However when it comes to portfolio construction, trade execution and risk management, thats where I feel the quantitative process shines. I think quants can do an excellent job of stock selection as well and our firm will probably be 100% quantitative one day, but so far we have resisted that because our founding partners are very much fundamental/discreationary guys at heart. When I first came on board, our fundamental group was more of an Event Driven, value w/ a catalyst shop dominated by risk arbitrage, special situations, high yield &amp; distressed credit, and long/short value. Over time we migrated more toward long/short equity with a focus on quality as we came to the realization that while its nice to have a catalyst, if it doens't play out your stuck in a value trap vs buying higher quality companies that will continue to compound earnings. My move into quant came about in early to mid 2000's. I started looking at what our quant guys were doing and asked if I could borrow one. They were leaps and bounds ahead of what we were doing when it came to portfolio construction, risk management and trade execution. 

2) I think anytime you mix illiquidity with quarterly redemptions you are asking for trouble. If I were running a family office or closed-end style fund where I didn't have to worry about redemptions I would end up running a mix of public and private investments all based on relative opportunity. In the past I have been involved in distressed, PIPE's, SPACs and even private lending. I haven't done any control or activist investing though. I think there are really good oportunities in those spaces, but it just doesn't work when you have to manage liquidity.  

2b) I can't think of any off the top of my head, most look OK at first and then end up blowing up. Not because they are wrong necessarily, but they just suffer a run on the bank. I think what Richard Rainwater did with Bass Brothers is the style I would attempt to emulate. A mix of public, private and third party managers as well as a blend of quantitative strategies and fundamental, long term holdings if I were managing permanent capital. The quant strategies would essentially be a holding place until an opportunity became available in public or private markets. Third party managers would be skewed towards smaller, early stage quant where I would own a stake in the firm and would utilize a seperate account so that I could take advantage of my own back office to realize operational efficiences, maintain liquidity, and for risk management purposes.  

3) Yes, to some degree. I really enjoy the portfolio management part but the management stuff I don't care for so much. "
2016-03-01 13:24:57,"I've pretty much been operating under the assumption that at the end of the day, you can't turn deep dive fundamental research driven investing over to the quants. Do you think that's the case? "

Yes each group has its own High Water Mark as well as one for the firm. I both love and loathe the HWM. I feel like they are wonderful tool for investors but at the same time I have seen time and time again where a fund will post a losing year, the talent flees to a either a different shop or they close and reopen under a new name so no high water mark. The other scenario that I see a lot and happened to us, was that investors will pull money after a down year and then come back after a good year. When they pulled their money they lost the benefit of their high water mark. Granted, one of the main reasons they redeemed from us was that we were liquid and had not utilized gates or sidepockets, so I guess it worked out in the end. Its kind of ridiculous really and defeats the purpose. Plus, we had been closed to new money so when we reopened we had some decent inflows from new investors that didn't have the previous high water mark. 

I really feel like our risk controls and strategy mix will prevent us from having an awful year. In 2008, our systematic global macro group did an outstanding job. Had we been able to trade thru the crisis, our long/short group would have ended up doing well because we would have been in a net short position. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, we moved to a heavy cash position and missed many opportunities because we did not know if we were going to even have a viable business model the next day. Redemptions were coming in and we felt an obligation to actually meet them, unlike some firms. "

2016-02-29 14:52:56,"I would describe it as growth is simply growth in Sales, Earnings, Cash Flow, Book Value and when applicable dividends. Momentum is more of a technical measure, in my opinion. It is really another way of saying serial correlation. For the most part, the two kinda go hand in hand in the sense that a company that is consistently growing will see their stock price rising, or vice versa.  

Personally, I don't feel standard deviation is a good risk measure. Professionally, everyone else does and so I'm somewhat beholden to it. I think downside deviation is a better measure when evaluating a manager or strategy. 

When evaluating hedge funds, I prefer to look at what the underlying factors they bring to the table. For instance, most arbitrage strategies are really nothing more than a combination of short puts and illiquidity, whereas CTA's are generally long volatility. Knowing this, if I want true diversification and downside protection, I am more apt to add CTA manager to my portfolio vs a merger arb or convert arb guy because when the world blows up the CTA is going to benefit vs the arb guy who is going to get crushed. Speaking of factors, I think investors greatly underestimate the risk of illiquidity. It looks great because it gives the appearance of bringing stabilility and low vol, but in reality when the write downs come or when it comes time to trade it you get slaughtered. 

We use a predictive beta when constructing our long and short portfolio's. For the most part, I don't see a big difference between the two but we optimize and trade our positions daily. I'm not sure how accurate we would be if we went further out and tried to predict beta or volatility over a longer horizon. "

2016-02-29 10:43:33,"Thank you. Yeah, I'll keep answering as long as they keep coming in!

When a thesis doesn't prove out, I blow out of the position. For the most part, we don't rely on catalyst. We stick to higher quality companies. Good margins, good returns, low debt, management incentives, etc... I like to think our catalyst is that the companies will compound earnings and book value. 

As for smoke signals, we watch the numbers. We have our estimates of what kind of range we expect those to fall in. We don't try to predict EPS to the penny each and every quarter, but we know what range they should come in at. Sales, margins, ROA/ROE/ROIC, accruals are all things we would watch. If these start to deteriorate, thats a red flag. Management generally sells stock via 10b5-1 plans all the time, so thats not a big deal but when we see management bailing on their companies shares. Red flag. 

We also watch the stock. If it drops and we cannot explain, we bail. In my opinion, one mistake I see people make is that they will immediately add to a position when it drops instead of investigating why. When you think you should double down you should probably sell and when your ready to finally capitulate thats when you should probably be buying or doubling down if that makes sense? "

2016-02-29 03:21:30,"In the case of Tiffany &amp; Co., more shares were issued than repurchased. A company can do both at the same time. This is why you should focus on net buybacks (change in shares outstanding, cash paid for repurchases - cash received from the issuance of common stock in the cash flow statement), not on the company's announcement to buyback shares

As noted before, share repurchases reduce shares outstanding, no matter if retired or not. Since all per-share numbers as book value per share or EPS are defined as ""... divided by shares outstanding"", they increase proportionally when shares outstanding decrease.

Because the number of shares decrease, every single share's fraction of the companies assets, earnings and dividends increases. As the value per share increases, the stock price may increase as well. So a buyback tends to be positive for owners of common stock.

But there may be a more efficient use for the company's money, like (re)investing, acquisitions, paying dividends, paying down debt or just saving the money to increase liquidity.

For example, if the company could generate a return on equity of 12% with an investment into the company's operations, but instead repurchases shares at a Price to earnings ratio of 20, it yields a poor 5% return for their stockholders instead of 12%, all other things being equal.

There are some reasons why managements might tend to buy back shares, even when it is not the most efficient use for excess capital.

1.) Managements often are evaluated and paid on the basis of per share numbers. Moreover, employee stock options are tied to the share price. Decreasing the numbers of shares outstanding via buybacks is the most easy way to improve per share numbers in the short term and support the share price.

2.) Buybacks conceal the negative effect of employee stock options, which increase the number of shares outstanding when exercised. So the company may have paid a considerable proportion of the earnings to the management, even though the numbers per share were unchanged.

3.)When the management fears to miss the analysts (per share) estimates, it may repurchase shares to obscure the management's problems in reaching an over-optimistic guidance."

2016-02-29 01:38:51,Thanks!
2016-02-29 01:33:23,"lol Well, my whole philosophy is based on protecting my downside. When trades go against me, I will cut exposure. My motto is live to fight another day. I know what I do works over the long term. I also know that not every environment is going to be good for what I do. I am not going to be a double up to catch up kind of guy. If its not a good market for me, I will move to cash and wait until a more opportune time. When things are going my way then I will increase exposure. I guess thats a long winded way of saying, don't lose it! The reason why I say that is, you see it as $20K of fun money you lose today. I see it as you loosing $300,000 in 20 years ($20,000 invested in the market, earning 7% a year with an additional $5,000 added per year) My advice, put it in an index fund and deposit another $5,000 per year. 

So, with al that being said, if your bound and determined to invest in stocks I would say look at the consumer sector. I really, really believe the consumer is stronger than they are getting credit for. I have mentioned AAPL, KORS and GPS in a previous post as names we currently own. Thats a good place to start I think. Research those and see if you like them. Work on coming up with an estimate of what you think they will be worth in 3-5 years. Discount that back to today using whatever your hurdle rate is. I think 15% is a good rate, but feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with. Compare that value to the current price. If it is trading at a 75-80% discount to your estimate of fair value, I'd say you probably have a winner. If its trading at a 90% discount you may want to check your assumptions. "

2016-02-28 22:46:07,"For the most part, I'm looking for people with relevant expereince. I like IBK because thats where I came from and they have the modeling skills I need them to have. Plus we have all been thru the same haze. Maybe thats ridiculous, but it counts becaue I know what I can expect from them. I know how they think and how they act. I hired one guy that doesn't have an IBK backgroud. To get on our team, the team has to want you. I could override them but I don't. 

I'm happy to look at an idea you like and give you feedback. To give you some idea of what our team does: each analyst covers a sector and is an expert on that sector. They maintain models for every company in their universe and sort them into deciles by price to value. Because we are long/short are ideas are all judged on their relative merits. If you have 50 names in your universe, you are expected to have 5 longs and 5 shorts.  

Walter took Ben Grahams course at Columbia, so while its true he didn't have a formal education, he wasn't totally self taught either. "
2016-02-28 22:31:05,"I understand that it is highly unconventional, not to mention rare to find someone that would fit the bill and lack a degree, but im just trying to get a sense on how much a degree is actually a necessity relative to a person being able to demonstrate that they can add value and make you money. 

I can only assume that when I say no degree many people would turn you away simply based on the risk of hiring an unknown quantitiy, however insofar as showing that you're passionate and a better than average, would that in some way narrow that quality of being an unknown? Especially considering that there have been some notable investors that had no formal education, Walter Schloss being the main example coming to mind."
2016-02-28 22:14:54,"I think Warren is a genius. I mean, if I was running my own capital, didn't have to worry about redemptions or volatility I would run a similar approach to what he espouses: run a concentrated 8-12 name portfolio with low turnover. 

In all honesty, probably not. To be fair, thats how Michael Burry got his start if I'm not mistaken. He was posting ideas on a bulletin board and Joel Greenblatt found him. Called him up and gave him some money to run. That ultimately didn't work out when he decided to short subprime, but all's well that ends well. So it's doable. "

2016-02-28 21:57:15,"Thanks for the ama. 
What are your thoughts on Warren Buffett and his aproach to investing. I understand it differs in many ways from your own strategy.

Also, would you ever take seriously someone that is self taught, (no degree, but utilized a number of resources) but could demonstrate talent and knowledge in investing that goes beyond that of your average analyst?"
2016-02-28 21:55:06,"Yeah, some of the bigger names I like Joel Greenblatt, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, most of the Tiger Cubs, Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, George Soros. In the long only world I really like the guys at IVA. There are a  number of quantitative managers and smaller long/short guys that I think are very smart but they fly under the radar. 

Each analyst follows a specific industry and follows it very closely. He is the SME and ranks every company in his universe by decile or price to value. We use a 3-5 year time frame. The top decile becomes our long portfolio and bottom decile becomes our short portfolio. 

We do a quality of earnings analysis as part of our due diligence, mainly looking at accruals. We also scrutinize anything on the balance sheet that is subject to someone elses valuation, for instance illiquid assets. Regarding illiqiud assets there is a joke I like about interviewing accountants that goes: 1st guy comes in and you ask him, whats 1+1? He says 2. Thank you for coming by. Second guy comes by, same thing. Thanks for coming by. Third person comes in and says, what do you want it to be? Thats the guy you hire!

Serial aquirers can be good and bad. I mean, Buffett is a serial aquirer and he has done a great job. Danaher has done a pretty good job. Kinder Morgan has done a good job. That was basically Richard Rainwaters strategy for years, buy a stock and agitate for change to get the multiple up. Once he was trading at a premium, go forth and aquire and arbitrage the difference between the multiples. On the flip side, there have been a lot companies that do dumb deals. It is really situationally dependent.

2016-02-28 18:35:05,"Yes and no. For the most part our short book is overvalued junk and mean reversion type trades. That being said, we do look for those that we feel have been less than honest with their accounting and/or just have poor business models relative to the competition. On average, I would say we generate 3-4% alpha on the short side each year. 

We used to have a decent size event drive team that did merger arb, but we shut them down in 2006. That was the year we cut a number of groups because we didn't feel like there was a lot of value there. Event Driven, Structured Credit, Energy, and everything illiquid. We wanted to move more towards liquid strategies and more of a long volatility type exposure for the portfolio. Reallocated money into our Quantitative trading and research, Systematic Global Macro and Long/Short equity teams. There are some good dudes out there that run Event Driven and Merger Arb teams, but for the most part I feel like merger arb doesn't provide a lot value. When you run a factor model on it, it is nothing more than selling puts on the S&amp;P 500.  "

2016-02-28 18:17:38,"We don't use Monte Carlo or WACC. I don't even think companies use WACC when making capital allocation decisions, to be honest. I am very skeptical when people show up with overly precise earnings models. I just want to be in the ballpark with my estimates. 

For the most part we are going to be long quality and value and short junk. Over the long haul, I know this will work. There are times however when the market rewards junk vs quality. In those instances, our performance lags and we reduce exposure. We try to avoid this by runnnig a balanced book with regards to our sector exposures, for instane during the most recent energy bubble we were long CLR and short CHK based on balance sheets and management,  but it doesn't always work out for us becasue sometimes investors want junk companies. 

For your position sizing, as an individual, I would say that if you aren't comfortale putting at least 5% in a name, don't do it. Stick to a small portfolio of 8-12 or 10-15 names. 

Our trading costs are de minimus due to our size and volume. Additionally we get a rebate from the exchanges because we utilize limit orders and are considered a liquidity provider. We trade daily because our price/value and thus the risk/reward changes daily. As that changes, our optimization would change. Honestly, it probably wouldn't make much of a difference if we only traded once a month or once a quarter, maybe a couple of basis points or so. From a volatlityly standpoint, it makes a noticable difference though. 

All our optimization process's are internally generated. There is some academic research our there on CDaR and CVaR. MSCI Barra is expensive, probably not worth it to you as an individual. "
2016-02-28 18:17:03,"Great thread. It seems like the names in your short book are ""expensive and lower quality"" to offset your longs. Are there any ""alpha"" shorts in the book? Maybe a fraud/fad business model that isn't used to manage net exposure that has more conviction behind the position (sizing). Also, does your fund do any merger arb?

Great thread.

2016-02-28 17:55:33,Is there a realistic transition from S&amp;T to a hedge fund on a PM track? I'm looking to working on a distressed or structured credit desk (or a structuring team) so I can get modeling experience but I'm not sure what the path forward is if I want to move into HFs. 
2016-02-28 17:52:43,[deleted]
2016-02-28 17:27:35,"Its spread pretty evenly now because we have a good team. I'm very transparent and everyone knows how much is in the pool to distribute. Early on, I was rewarding the hard workers and consistent earners and then replacing the guys who weren't going to cut it. Its very much a meritocracy now and even though I retain final say on the team, everyone has a voice on who we bring on board. I think we do a good job of screening for team oriented people, but compensation is always a tricky issue. Now that I get part of the partner pool, I am inclined to distribute more of our teams pool to the team. If someone where to step up and say they wanted my job or wanted to be a pm, then I would most likely give them shot with small chunck of our dough. See what they could do and let them grow into the position, so to speak. I've even considered letting each analyst run his own sub portfoio while keeping the allocation and risk management decisions at my level. I think we would struggle under that model though because I don't hire traders, I hire analyst and those are two very different skill sets. Right now with the way its set up, all they have to do is company and industry research. I take their info and build the portfolio. I take on that burden so they don't have to. Some of these guys, they don't want to trade.  "
2016-02-28 17:25:48,"Thanks, very interesting. Do you use Monte Carlo simulation to get the estimates of fair values? What distribution shapes do you typically use for the different valuation inputs (WACC, growth rate, etc)? In what situations does the model fail? Sorry for the specific questions, I'm not a professional and interested in building my own model for position sizing. Have you looked at the affect on your fund's returns if you reduced your transaction costs by optimizing much less frequently? Like monthly or quarterly? I'll look into MSCI Barra, do recommend any readings that discuss the type of portfolio optimization you do or are they all somewhat fund-specific?"
2016-02-28 17:12:17,"Yes, just be persisitent. Have some ideas you can intelligently discuss. Additionally, know the environment and be able to talk about the space in an intelligent manner. "
2016-02-28 17:07:58,"Not in my opinion. Of those I would prefer a math or econ, but thats just my preference. I was triple major in Political Science, Philosophy and Economics.

2016-02-28 16:31:48,How do you think about your team's comp? Like do you give analysts a certain % of the pool or do you try to target an absolute number for compensation of your employees?
2016-02-28 16:12:55,"Do Engineering, CompSci, Econ, Finance, or math undergrad degrees not really make a difference then? 
And would a place like UMichigan be good enough?"

I thought so, could I PM you to ask a more detailed question?"
2016-02-28 15:13:23,Why do you use CDaR instead of CVaR? Do you calculate your own return probability distribution based on your valuation or do you use daily past returns as done conventionally with portfolio optimization?
2016-02-28 14:54:46,"How much does the prestige of your undergraduate degree matter for getting these jobs? Is it very hard to get a job as an analyst at a HF if you don't go to Wharton, Harvard, Yale Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, etc.?

Also do you look for people with specific degrees? Would you hire a computer science major as an analyst? Or do you look for econ/finance majors?"

2016-02-28 14:11:31,"We use a forecasted beta similar to how we forecast volatility. I, as the PM, don't forecast these, instead I load our long and short portfolio names into the ""flux capacitor"" along with our price/value estimates. Our Portfolio Management System then takes all the quant factors into consideration and spits out ""optimized"" portfolios. 

If I were doing the position sizing, I would simply weight the names according to price/value and someitmes I compare the two just to see what my discreationary portfolio would look like vs what we are actually running. Thats mainly for my benefit and curiosity. If there are large discrepancies I will investigate them, but they are usually very similar from a high level. "
2016-02-28 14:03:55,"We attempt to predict it with a vol forecast, but if our realized vol spikes we will make adjustments. "
2016-02-28 13:42:10,Thanks for the clarification. Does your firm use backward looking measures for volatility or tries to predict it (for the sake of maintaining constant volatility)? 
2016-02-28 13:32:34,Definitely share bro
2016-02-28 13:29:41,"Gotcha, sorry that was confusing.  I feel like once you introduce derivatives, shorting and leverage into a portfolio beta becomes useless. When evaluating long only its fine. A lot of ""hedge funds"" I feel are nothing more than leveraged beta. They are leverage and long some underlying index and provide no real value. 

Our main focus is on managing risk and targeting a specific volatility. You are seeing some of this bleed over into the long only world with some of the new ""constant volatility"" products that are coming out. We utilize CDaR as our main constraint. In laymans terms we want to reduce the risk of drawdowns and as volatility spikes in our book, we reduce exposure to maintan a constant volatility. As we reduce our exposure, we are generally increasing expsoure in another area of the firm that. If the firm as a whole is spiking, we cut positions. We aren't going to hold onto losing positions just to maintain a volatility though and will go to cash in order to preserve capital and live to fight another day. 

I hope this helps???"
2016-02-28 13:17:54,"Its not that the info the program covers ins't valuable, its just that doing the valuation work we do is more analagous to that of investment banking. Wall Street Prep is the firm I used to recommend for their self study program, but its been a few years since I looked at it. For the most part I feel like the CFA is a marketing gimick.

Best bet as a sell side analyst is to put out good research. Talk to the brokers that cover the firms you want to specifically get in front of and make sure you communicate with them. If you do good work then they will want to put you in front of the managers to discuss your ideas. From there, you can work on developing a relationship with the managers and then leverage that. "
2016-02-28 13:14:25,"I ask because beta seems to be the foundation of how your firm measures performance and execute your strategies and it is something that you find useful (you talked about beta exposure, leveraged beta, etc. etc.). But then again you just said beta is garbage so I'm a bit confused. I was wondering if you can offer some remedies to the drawbacks. I find beta to be mostly, if not completely, useless for making investment decisions. 

I do agree with your risk analysis for the funds (from a very general perspective)."
2016-02-28 12:55:56,"I do, but all our quant guys are PhD's. Quant trading is really nothing more than academic research. Its a wonkish profession and nothing prepares you for that like a PhD and doing original research. The only difference between academia and quant trading is you generally don't publish your results for peer review. Thats like giving away the secret sauce. "
2016-02-28 12:33:45,"Book value is net assets (which is equal to total shareholder equity because assets - liabilities = equity, i.e. assets net of liabilities equal total equity).

Total shares outstanding may creep up over time due to stock options issued to employees that vest and are exercised, leading to new share issues throughout the year."

The PM I worked under went to the same undergrad, so I leveraged that and my experience in banking to get an interview. For some reason, he liked me and gave me an internship offer. At the end of the summer he made me an offer to come on board as analyst and the rest is history. At that time, people were either going banking, consulting or start ups. I didn't have as much competition for a spot. "
2016-02-28 12:16:06,"Thanks so much for the response!

That was what I was thinking too. I'd pursue an MS in Comp Sci over an MBA because I'm attracted to all that quant stuff. I'd consider an MFE as well but I've been hearing a lot about how the degree is oversaturated. 

A PhD is a pretty large time commitment. Do you think the advantage it gives over a Masters is worth it in this context?"
2016-02-28 12:13:44,"Thanks. More question about beta. Statistically speaking the betas derived from regression is garbage. R2 value is generally terrible. Yes there is ""smart beta"" but they generally fall into the same trap. They move with the market (i.e. 5-year beta could be 0.5 today and 0.7 next year) and also differ depending on the time horizon (1 year, 10 year, 3 months, etc.), furthermore, they can also differ depending on the interval chosen (week, year, month, day)."

2016-02-28 11:49:33,Thanks for doing this; it's been very insightful.  I'd love to hear a little more about how you broke into the firm/industry in the first place.  You said you started right out of bschool--how did you get that first position? Were you from a target school or non-target? What type of experience did you have before bschool?
2016-02-28 11:48:51,"Yes, we have to borrow the shares from our prime broker. For the most part, we stay away from hard to borrow becasue the interest and potential for a short squeeze. 

Our commissions are cheap, we trade for less than a penny a share and becaue we use nothing but limit orders we get an exchage rebate to offset a lot of the costs. Retail commissions would be a killer. "
2016-02-28 11:45:44,"You are ahead of the curve, dude. The only reason I would go to grad school is if you want to. There are always risks in hedge funds, your AUM is most likely sunject to quarterly redemptions so you constantly face a run on the bank. You also risk a blow up which leaves you out of a job. 

I think quant is going to continue to dominate and if you have the desire and ability would encourage you to pursue a PhD in a math, science or comp sci field. "

I find it hard to analyze this kind of stuff though. Your approach of looking at the NAV of the ships is absolutely correct when cash flows are this unpredictable. But there is debt, so a large part of your analysis should be the probability of a default and the aftemath for shareholders. You've obviously looked at that, but I'm not convinced there is an adequate margin of safety like there was for Wabash National. So I like the analysis but I don't agree with the conclusion."
2017-03-16 15:40:46,"This question isn't so bad :p. If you look at the 8-K they filed on March 30 2016 you'll see the following:

11.2 (m) Negative covenants: Acquisition of capital assets. 

None of the Borrower or the Guarantors shall **acquire any capital assets (including any vessel other than a Ship) by purchase, charter or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders**, provided that for the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Clause 11.2(m) shall prevent or be deemed to prevent capital improvements being made to a Ship.

So you can see that they can acquire so long as they are given permission by the Lenders. In this case, I imagine the Lenders gave them the go ahead to possibly acquire a vessel with the cash proceeds they received. Hope this answers your question!

p.s.  Glad I was able to produce a good idea that helped the sub out!"

2017-03-16 12:33:36,"The percentage of sales coming from mobile phones is up dramatically over the last half dozen years.  If it weren't for phones, revenue declines would have been much steeper.  Also, half of revenues come from selling Apple, Samsung, HP, Sony and LG products, which I assume are basically phones, computers and TVs, the bulk of which are still sold in person.

I also think current management has done a really good job.  If you go back 5 years or so, BBY had way too many stores and a bloated cost structure.  Management has done a lot to streamline the operations.  In my view, you have to treat the recent improvements in margins as one time operational improvements rather than a change in the underlying trend. "

2017-03-16 11:58:36,"The past 5 years have been pretty resilient. Granted no sales growth or gross margin improvement but they've improved their bottom line earnings efficiency. They also blasted operating cash flow this year.

Do you think phone sales is really how the company is maintaining footing? I feel there has to be more to it than that."
2017-03-16 11:43:54,"If you look at BBY's financial results for the last 15 years, you can see that tide has been pulling against them.  Operating margins peaked in 2007, revenue peaked in 2011, SSS fluctuate from year to year, but in general has been flat to negative.

I would suggest that the downward path will continue to be slow but inexorable.  I will acknowledge though that their business has held up better than I would have expected.  In part, I think it is due to the factor you state - a big chuck of their sales is for big ticket items that customers wish to buy in person.  Another reason is that they have changed their business model somewhat  - a big part of their business is now selling mobile phones which in general still take place in person."

Keep in mind that a good/serious company will have some kind of reserve since the auditors will **demand** it.

So, your new scenario:

BEFORE:

* Gross Income $0
* Tax $0
* Net Income: $0

AFTER:

* Gross Income &lt;$50,000&gt;
* Tax $0
* Net Income: &lt;$50,000&gt;
* Could be a NOL carry over (there's more to that), someone would say that a NOL carry over is a tax shield.
* NOTE: no change in cash in this scenario

"
2017-03-16 08:50:38,"Im just asking a question, you seem to be getting mad. 

I was thinking more along the line if EBT were 0 and then suddenly its -50 from the bad debt then it would just be a NOL carry forward. i dont think a tax shield is always there."
2017-03-16 08:42:21,"&gt; Well why would it only reflect 25% of the 50, given a 50% tax rate.

Not sure where you get that.

&gt; Im not sure how the tax shield would apply to a debt being fully deductible.

???????




Let's try this, assuming there's no reserve.

BEFORE:

* Gross Income $1,000,000
* Tax $500,000
* Net Income: $500,000

AFTER:

* Gross Income $950,000
* Tax $475,000
* Net Income: $475,000

2017-03-16 08:21:25,"Yes it is, this is what I said:

&gt; Make an entry in the Income Statement for Bad Debt

(it decreases Gross Income)"
2017-03-16 08:02:19,"Is there wasnt a bad debt allowance, why wouldnt the debt be fully deductible from gross income? "
2017-03-16 07:37:13,[deleted]
2017-03-16 07:13:44,"Depends

3 ways this goes

**Option 1:**

There's a reserve, something along the lines of *Allowance for Bad Debt* / *Bad Debt Allowance*, in which case:

* Decrease Bad Debt Allowance (Balance Sheet)
* Decrease Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)

Done, no changes to the Income Statement'
No change to Cash

**Option 2:**

NO reserve.

* Decrease Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)
* Make an entry in the Income Statement for Bad Debt

Income decreases by $50M, if Income before this was &gt;$50M then yes the effect to Net income would be $25M (assuming 50% tax rate). I guess as a ripple effect of the tax write off there will be a lesser Cash outflow.

**Option 3:**  There's a reserve in place which is less than $50M so it's a mix of 1 and 2 above.

NOTE: If the company doesn't have an *Allowance for Bad Debt* under the assumption that the business doesn't warrant one (strange that the auditors would allow this), after this event the auditors would no longer allow it and going forward there would be *Allowance for Bad Debt* / *Bad Debt Allowance*."

2017-03-15 19:22:28,"I've been hearing a lot from this kind of investor lately. Intense focus on finding the best business models and increasingly less focus on valuation.

2017-03-15 19:02:03,"Look here is the problem. Those are all really valid things, but how do you quantify that? How can we quantify that for the company? How much will that impact, what if the volume of goods isn't as much as the change in value? That's like a journey down the rabbit hole of infinity of possibilites. The goal here is to value the single company and see if this is a good investment, and I don't think that's something that you can honestly create real outcomes to forecast onto price. These things will likely effect most of everything pretty uniformly, and thus I feel like it's not worth the rabbit hole.

Buffett notoriously DOESN'T macro forecast, nor does Marks, and Dalio is in a slightly different game in my opinion. This is security analysis, and you're describing trade and economic analysis. Are these the most relevant factors that will drive the valuation? Or is the claims on ships vs NAV the most relevant factors to valuation. I'm going to go with the latter, and even with significant volatility in trade scenarios, the latter is likely to still be within a band of values, especially considering that ships have scrap value at some point. It's the forest for the trees, what actually matters versus what we could intellectualize for years. My opinion, and I can be wrong so YMMV. "

Scared of the shift? Not so much. But I'm not ignorant to history and markers that predate certain events that have a drastic effect on economic factors. Nothing I said in there was a lie...

From their last 10-Q, filed November 9 of last year:

&gt;The First Lien Facility contains financial covenants requiring Eagle Shipping, among other things, to ensure that the aggregate market value of
the vessels in the Company’s fleet (plus the value of certain additional collateral) at all times on or after July 1, 2017 does not fall below 100% in the
third and fourth quarters of 2017, 110% in 2018 and 120% in 2019 of the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (subject to certain adjustments)
under the First Lien Facility and maintain minimum liquidity of not less than the greater of (i) $8,140,000 and (ii) $185,000 per vessel in the Company’s
fleet. In addition, the First Lien Facility also imposes operating restrictions on Eagle Shipping including limiting Eagle Shipping’s ability to, among
other things: pay dividends; incur additional indebtedness; create liens on assets; **acquire and sell capital assets (including vessels)**; and merge or
consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all of Eagle Shipping’s assets to, another person.

Which seems inconsistent with their [current report](http://www.eagleships.com/sec-filing-display/?url=http%3A%2F%2Firxml.corporate-ir.net%2Ffilings%2Ftext.data%3Fid%3D11277829%26vid%3DaHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExMjc3ODI5JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3%26compId%3D189576) (among others) filed a month later on December 13, which states:

&gt;On December 13, 2016, Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (the “Company,” “Eagle Bulk,” “we,” “our” or similar terms), a Republic of the Marshall Islands corporation, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investors in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) approximately 22.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at an initial purchase price of $4.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $100.0 million. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for the **acquisition of dry bulk tonnage** and general corporate purposes.

Surely I'm missing something huge. Thoughts? I haven't gone through everything.


Edit: you also need to look careful at how the debt is structured. You may want to model debt repayments vs cash flows in excel to get a good grasp of how it will play out. I think you're being optimistic in your assessment of the debt and the fate of common stockholders when they run into trouble again.

2017-03-15 14:00:07,"2 big questions:

1. it looks like they already defaulted on their debt, which is leading to the cash sweep. The debt is due in 2019 and there is no way they are going to generate $250mn in cash to pay off the whole principal, so in that case what happens? Do they refinance?

2: 

&gt;In a worst case scenario if vessels are written down to 40 % - 50 % of their book value and shares are increased by 80 % - 100 % over the next 6 – 18 months, NAV per share can range from $ 3.24 - $ 5.46 per share which results in a – 41 % to – 1 % downside.

What are you assuming is the price for the dilution? I would assume if they are using PIPEs then either the price is lower than market, or early investors are getting warrants of some kind?

The last question I have is on liquidity but is more of an afterthought. You can't really pitch this to a fund because it looks like 66,000 shares have traded so far today, and only 100,000 yesterday (x$5/share = $500,000 in dollar value/day). Would be impossible for a fund to get in and out of, and would drastically destroy downside calculations due to difficulty in trading at the time you'd actually need the liquidity."

2017-03-15 13:02:31,"Sorry its taken me so long to respond. I had meant to since you specifically referenced me. I didn't have time to look at the whole write-up for you but I did check out your tear sheet and write some notes. By the way, you have a very familiar looking format. 

Odds are you will only get a PM to, at most, read your tear sheet so extra attention should be paid to it. There may be some things that I point you that are better elaborated on in your appendix pages, but the point is that not everyone will read that part. 

First thing is that at the top of your page I would rather see a model of historical/projected financials rather than a 12 month price performance chart. 

Under thesis point 1, you state that ""TDOC is nothing more than a call center operator with little to-no proprietary technology"" and ""unachievable growth projections"". This makes up the bulk of your variant opinion and is very important, but you need to explain the WHY behind these points and how they are detrimental to future operating results. 

Under point 3, you reference lack of profitability but this is kinda meaningless without context, which is why I suggested adding a brief historical model somewhere on the front page. You should also maybe include some language as to WHY adjusted EBITDA is slated to become profitable/why you disagree. 

Under point 4, you reference a $29bn TAM that is barely penetrated, but this is an example of something that should be quantified for the reader. Also, ""while there is no denying the market for broad based telehealth adoption is large"" is 100% fluff material and doesn't belong on the tear sheet. Every sentence should be a fact or something that supports a view of yours. 

I disagree with including point 5 on your tear sheet. As others have pointed out, it is probably anecdotal evidence at best and doesn't really add anything to your variant opinion. Lots of people hate lots of companies, and I can probably find negative reviews out there easily. Over the past 6 years, EA's stock has grown 30% annualized despite being named one of the worst companies in America and I could blindly throw a rock in any direction and find a negative review of their company. 

The bit about the credit agreement is super interesting here. I think it is important enough to warrant a sport as a full investment thesis point. 

Your REAL catalyst for this thesis is Q4 2017 earnings. You should make that your big, exclusive point under your catalyst section. 

Everything else looks fine to me. The only other bit I might include is that I think your thesis is strong enough, and the operating model deterioration will be big enough to yield an attractive valuation without implying a multiple re-rate. That is just something about me, I don't like to assume re-rates in my theses. 

But overall I think this is pretty good. I have glanced through the remainder of the pages and they look strong. Wish I could comment more on the validity of your work, but what I hope to communicate here is how to better format/present your work to an audience. "

2017-03-15 11:47:30,"I like it.

Reminds me that I need to take a deeper look into on going debt and the associated parameters with my own DD's.

One thing I'm finding concerning for the world economy, and the relative industries that rely on it, is the ever more rising of 'populism', as the socio-economists are calling it. We called it 'patriotism' back in the day. Nationalism, secularism... the list goes on. In small quantities it's not much to worry about, but when entire countries are doing it... Well... it literally predates every major conflict we've seen in the past... forever.

Historically, it seems to mirror some sort of domino effect. The splitting of the Roman Empire led to the wars/skirmishes during the 16th and 17th century in Europe, eventually leading to major conflicts like the French and American revolutions. The splitting of social/religious/political/economic ideas in America that led to the Civil war. WW1, WW2... The list goes on. When people start to close off their ideologies, war seems to be the only route in which the close-mindedness is alleviated.

I don't know if we'll have another world war. Nukes are a scary thing, and no world leader wants to be that guy. I don't think we'll see another civil war in America... But I do know we've seen this sort of collective behavior before. 

Like Nietzsche said... 
'Insanity in individuals is somewhat rare. But in groups, parties, nations, and epochs, it is the rule.'

Can I ask a favor? Ive got a DD I did on AOBC... There's a post somewhere around here with links to my (newborn) blog. I'm fairly new to Reddit so I'm not too well versed on the ins and outs of proper link posting.. If you could be so kind to check it out and give me your two cents, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2017-03-15 08:51:32,"Been interested in fund structures, regulations, and requirements. Does anyone have a good place for resources? 

Particularly interested in fund exemptions. How is a private fund defined? Once you reach 100 investors what are the additional reporting requirements? How are clients, related parties, and knowledgeable employees defined? I have been relying on Google so just looking for a good resource short of the securities act to read.  "
2017-03-15 08:33:09,"as you've now seen, hedge funds are not only behind the eight ball in terms of fees (never make up the difference to the market), but also in ongoing regulatory requirements, audit, and general management expenses (i have friends who run them;  some have said to do things right requires at least $200k a year -- this particular friend managed ~3B).  
  
the managed account route is the smartest way to organize IF you feel the need to build the existing investment business.  by that i mean you need and want to attract more assets in a relatively short period of time.  IF all you care about is a track record, then you really don't need to bother with this.  setup a basic llc and begin executing.  depending on what state you live in, most have very friendly exemptions from state regulatory registration for friends and family (i know, i happen to live in one that doesn't).   

based on the above, i'd say the goal of being a ""hedge fund manager"" is more about ego than managing money."
2017-03-15 08:07:41,"For me, it depends on which part of the filing I am looking at.  If I'm reading through a business description or MD&amp;A, I typically will use my iPad (a five year old device) and I use GoodReader which is an app that provides a great deal of flexibility for marking up the text.  Although I have a bluetooth keyboard and have used it to take extensive notes in the MS Word app, if I'm going to be taking a lot of notes, I'll just use my laptop for that purpose.  My office has a two screen setup with my laptop serving as one screen and another screen set up next to it.  I can have the SEC filing next to a word document or an excel file so I can see both simultaneously.  My typical habit when learning about a company is to download the 10-K on my iPad, go to a coffee shop for a couple of hours to read the business description and MD&amp;A, and then return to my office when I get to the financials and footnotes so I can open excel and do more analytical work.

Cause shit happens. I like op margins personally (and EBITDA of course). Debt changes all the time. Taxes are deferred for whatever reason. New lines of credit, revolving lines of credit... Companies liquidate assets. Buy assets. M&amp;A's.

If I can't do the math in the my head, or with some simple multiplication/division, I'm not wasting my time on it.

Monkeys are at best 50/50 when we try and guess the future. Go look at all those EPS estimates that the big guys put out every year. How often are they right? Afterall, they are using DCF's and CAPM's with other little add-ons to get there... Notice how they change qtr to qtr and year to year... If that sort of breakdown was the way to go, why does it require constant revision and maintenance? 

Just a novice opinion. :)"

2018-04-01 00:58:42,"You wouldn't add book value to EBITDA ever.

Book value in a tech company is essentially useless because their intangible assets pretty much won't ever equal book value, nor will any of their tangible assets which are directly tied to the value of the intangibles.

However, in a pure valuation sense, you could do it on an EBITDA multiple (compared to your comps), but you wouldn't add it to the book value because an EBITDA multiple would encompass the book value of the assets. Similarly, were you to do a DCF, this would already be inclusive of the book value of the assets."
2018-04-01 00:56:51,"A company with a decreasing book is good most of the time. That means the company is earning a higher return on equity which benefits the investor. In MSFT's case, they have been repurchasing shares heavily which is good.

I look at book value + earning power + growth potential when valuing a company.


&gt; How is this a sane investment? What am I missing?

It doesn't need to be sane. If it doesn't make sense... move on.
"
2018-04-01 00:36:17,"Uh, yeah... I guess that is true to a certain extent.  But as you probably know, a huge number of market participants, from analysts to investors, attempt to divine what the ""true value"" of a company is that they might determine if it is over or under priced and, as the case may be, and go long or short.  All of this under the assumption that eventually the market achieves rationality in valuing a company.  As Buffett/Graham put it (paraphrasing here), ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine (price action/speculation), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (intrinsic value).""

So saying, ""it's all supply and demand"" doesn't really address my original question, nor does it add meaningfully to this conversation."
2018-04-01 00:30:44,"My calc was ([Total Assets $241.086B] - [Intangibles $45.228B] - [Liabilities $168.692B] = [Book Value $27.166B]).  As others are pointing out though, intangibles are much more ""tangible"" (for lack of a better phrase) for software makers than for, say, manufacturer's.  So maybe it makes sense to deduct goodwill, but not some other intangibles like IP.  The LinkedIn acquisition is a major driver of the decline in book value as I have calculated it as you can be sure there was a HUGE amount of goodwill built into that acquisition price.  I actually think MSFT has a great business, but I, like you, feel like it is excessively overpriced and am just trying to understand why."
2018-03-31 22:05:12,"What's your calculation for book value?  I'm getting $78B currently (Total assets - Total Liabilities).
  
IMO some of the excess pricing in the market for MSFT can be attributed to a number of things, such as potential from revenue growth in the social media space from the acquisition of LinkedIn, which closed at the end of 2016.   Also the market has added premium to all companies getting into the cloud and SaaS (which Microsoft has been doing).  The market also likes how CEO Nadella has been positioning the company strategically since he took over.
  
Microsoft goofed on the Phone business with the Nokia acquisition; however that event did not tank the stock.  
  
But I agree with you MSFT appears excessively priced.  The market may perceive a few other growth factors I haven't listed, yet."

However there can be times where second had ships are priced higher than new ships so it would be difficult to put into a formula and calculate out like you have done here. Would be awesome if you could somehow incorporate that (although i have no idea how). Like cheech401 said, the current daily rate and the historical yields would also be very  helpful. and an updated list of recent sales of ships and what price anad age they were.

2018-01-30 19:23:25,"A long only fund isn't able to charge 2% &amp; 20%. But many long only funds hold a good amount of cash (let's say ~20% cash).

This is the same exposure level as a long/short fund that is 100% long, 20% short. Both have 80% exposure. In fact, I'd argue that many long/short funds have more net long exposure than the average long only fund.

The only difference is the hedge fund is earning 2 &amp; 20, the long only isn't. 

The 20% incentive fee was designed for market neutral funds who were expected to have close to 0% exposure. This is why they were called ""hedge funds"" back in the 50s: they were actually hedged. Any profits were considered independent of market movement, and therefore they earned 20% of anything made.

In today's version of the hedge fund structure, my opinion is the fund should clear the hurdle of the investor's opportunity cost (let's say the S&amp;P 500 which earns 6% per year on avg, or 6% pro-rated for the fund's net exposure) before they can earn an incentive fee.

That's all I'm saying. 

If a fund has 20 or 30% net exposure, sure, they deserve a 20% incentive fee. That fund has built out a real short book and they should be earning 20% incentive fee because their exposure is so low.

There are a lot of hedge funds that masquerade as long/short funds - but operate as glorified long books with little to no hedging, yet they earn the big money for their services (2 &amp; 20%)."
2018-01-30 19:22:25,"I think the Fed is making mistakes nowadays. do you know that why japan failed to recover from 20 years of deflation? as you know they had enormous bubble in the late 80s and they were struggling to suppress it but failed back then. because of this memory. fear for bubble. they didn't supply sufficient money after the bubble collapsed. they thought like overly supplied money may reproduce the bubble.
 
And it's US's turn. After the collapse of the dot com bubble. Greespan has begun to supply more money than it's needed. which made a housing bubble and subprime crisis. and then Bernanke did it again to escape from subprime crisis. a systemic risk. it's worse than the aftermath of the dotcom bubble. there was no sufficient spare to lower interest rates. thus they brought unconventional monetary policy called QE. it's the history of past two decades. why did they do that? because they had too much fear to be same with japan. so they did opposite of japan. supplied too much money. one thing different than japan is that US has been exported these aftermath to overseas. i bet Global economy will suffer something seriously bad when interest rates goes back to normal level."
2018-01-30 19:22:00,"I've been expecting that a pick up in inflation has a better chance than a slow down in growth in the coming year. I prepared for that by including some concentration in financial companies, and a few energy companies. Given that this is a value investing subreddit, I'm betting that not much of the focus is on buying based on macro themes, but rather than buying a company at a good value. I'm working on my valuation skills, but I've been trading on macro themes with baskets of stocks and etfs for a while though."

2018-01-30 19:10:55,"I’m quite familiar with how hedge funds work. 

I still don’t understand you’re original point. If you run &lt;100% net exposure (on down to 0%), then charging 20% on profits make sense by the logic I laid out above. If you just use shorts to lever but maintain 100% net exposure, you shouldn’t clip 2 and 20 - are there a lot of funds that run 130/30 or 120/20 with 2 and 20 fee structures with no hurdles? I have not seen it. 


Also, 2 and 20 (with a big hurdle) is not 2 and 20 and introducing shorts to your portfolio so that you can charge “2 and 20” (but with a big hurdle) is not a free lunch.

"
2018-01-30 18:51:57,"Some funds do have &lt;100% exposure. But they are still earning 20% on that net exposure. 

True market neutral funds were what people had in mind when the hedge fund structure of a 20% incentive fee was designed. Non market-neutral funds should be using a hurdle rate to approximate beating their benchmark before earning an incentive fee.

Separately, many funds take the proceeds of their 30% short exposure, and then lever up to go 130% long (keeping their net exposure at 100%). That's the idea behind the ever popular 130/30 hedge fund. Or 120/20 hedge fund."

2018-01-30 17:49:37,Although you might right in general. it seems not a symmetrical thing if you look around other than US. there are more than 10 countries whose government bond rates are less than 1% and their P/E isn't that high. for example germany's 10 year government bond rate is only 0.691% and their P/E is only 13.8 even though their economy is good.

2018-01-30 17:47:06,"&gt;Timing is vital when short selling

People say this all the time but it makes no sense. If you are trying to generate alpha with shorts with no hedging (why???), yes, I guess. But otherwise, “timing” works exactly the same for longs and shorts (when compared to an index).

Your comment about the housing market shorts is true because of the nature of the specific derivative instruments they used (because they were liquid) to gain short exposure."
2018-01-30 17:45:21,"we are basically in the reverse 1950s. 

1950s -&gt; scarcity of capital (world blown up, massive growth from baby boom). Rates held low artificially to control war debt did not reflect the real rate which should be high due to low supply of capital and high demand for capital. Which was why asset prices such as stocks and houses were so cheap back then.

Now we are in the reverse, we have tons of capital, yet little demand for capital. Companies are rushing to hand that capital back and not really investing in anything. Unless we have a massive crisis (hyperinflation/deflationary shock) which wipes out capital or some suddenly massive capital intensive technological frontier coming (which AI isn't, if anything it will be capital light due to 0 marginal costs), then we are going to be in this environment for the foreseeable future.

2018-01-30 15:02:19,"I think he may have misspoke with the ""than there were last year"", only thing I could find was a ~45% decrease since '96.

&gt; It is no secret that the number of public companies in the U.S. has declined.  However, many investors are often surprised to hear that the number of publicly listed companies has fallen 45% from the peak in 1996, and as shown in this week’s chart, that the number of private companies worth over $1 billion – also known as “unicorns” – has increased over 38 times since the beginning of 2009. While some of this decline has been driven by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), the bulk has been due to the increased availability of private capital.

In fact let’s put it another way.

If assume low rates now lowers the discount rate of your valuation that’s fine. 

But then as growth picks up, surely rates will rise in the future thus:

1) increasing the future discount rate

2) lowering the future growth rate

So the net effect on your model shouldn’t be substantial. "

The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent which is why I'd never bother to short sell. Even those few famous for shorting the housing market in 07/08 almost entered too early and lost it all.

2018-01-30 09:10:20,"I agree I don't think anything said under myth #2 really makes the case that low interest rates don't lead to higher valuations.  In fact the first line of the paragraph says this: ""Low rates do influence valuations in practice, and the relationship between rates and valuations is tighter than theory suggests it should be. This fact, however, is beside the point.""  What?  Why is that besides the point?  The only real case it make is that your long term yield will be lower if you buy at a high P/E rather than a low one, regardless of rates.  Yes, that is certainly true, and I don't need charts to show me.  All things equal getting a 10% earnings yield today is better in the long term than getting a 5% earnings yield today.  That doesn't change the fact that getting a 5% earnings yield today looks a whole lot more attractive when interest rates are at 2% than when they are at 6%.  I'm sorry when you make a comment like ""the relationship between rates and valuations is tighter than theory suggests it should be."" then its time to re examine your theory and see what you are missing, not say ""this is besides the point.""

You are diluting and thus misallocating those funds that could have gone to productive means. You cannot just digitally print money and expect economic growth. Growth is created through cost cutting and production. It is about allocating limited resources to the most optimal means of production and creating wealth.

This is the exact point which Central banks tackle . Diluting is necessary because people won't do it by themselves, as once an economic crisis happens people stop taking risks because they are scared . 

Without central banks people would move money to developing countries. Central banks are one of the greatest assets for countries to avoid slipping to developing countries."

That being said, investing will be a slog at times.  I can’t think of another career where it’s just study, study, study day after day with no tangible results or action, sometimes for years on end.  You will get older, and your friends and family will have stories about what happened at their workplace and what they’ve done.  Your career will be much, much less exciting on a day to day basis, and it will get to you at some point, as you spend another day just studying.  You will need to get comfortable with the inaction but constant work."

2020-05-01 04:38:44,"Do you want the truth? 

Tesla is not ""leading"" anything environmentally. Production of cars, any cars is damaging. If you want to save the environment just don't ever buy a new car. That is much more helpful than buying a new Tesla. And ""environment"" means a lot more than what affects the climate. I have a 2004 model Toyota myself. I don't eat red meat. And, I rarely buy anything... even though I could buy whatever I want. I am not a Tesla hater. But, are you willing to darn your own socks instead of buying new ones? Do you think most people would give up the status of having a new iPhone and new shoes to save the environment? Or... is it just easier to believe supporting Tesla is the same thing? I am not judging either way.  Tesla, is a crutch psychologically.   


COVID-19 has done more for the environment that Tesla will ever do. It allows people to feel they are doing something good.  Instead of actually doing good

If you buy a new car or order something from Amazon you are destroying the planet. Not just from a CO2 perspective. Tesla factories use a LOT of oil. Manufacturing requires a lot of oil-based chemicals and lubricants. The Earth is ripped asunder to get at the materials needed to make those batteries.   
Tesla pollutes. They may pollute slightly less. But they pollute a hell of a lot more than if we just took the bus.  


Two decades ago kids learned to recycle. Why? Because China wanted to buy our scrap paper. Do we hear about recycling anymore? Are there fewer landfills? Did humanity change?   


If you want to save the planet. Walk, take the bus, ride a bike. If you can't move to a place you can. But, Tesla is just a penny stock to support Elon's ego. He is just profiteering off of people's hope. I am not attacking him for it. That is the why humans work. That is how religion works. That is how Santa works.  


In reality, it would take 10 Earth sized planets full of trees to stop it. We can't ""build"" a device capable of stopping it. Humans have released 100 million years of trapped carbon in the last 100. 100 million years of carbon trapped by the entire planet. You can do the math yourself here. 1 tree on average weighs 2 tons. 50% of that is carbon. There are about 3 trillion trees on Earth. Oil is the product of 155 million years of trees dying. We've released about 100 million years of it into the ocean and atmosphere. How long would it take to get that back out? The answer is... a 100 million years.   


There are two things most humans can not understand. One is scale. Climate change is a problem of scale. Similarly, we will never find aliens. It isn't that life doesn't exist. It's that humans, the whole of humanity, will not survive long enough for us to know. Humans will be extinct. That is how big the universe is. This is something that is hard for most people to understand. The vastness of space is incomprehensible. The amount of CO2 we've released is similarly incomprehensible. Most people don't understand that when they walk around there is between 600 and 700 lbs of air on your head. (Depending on the size of your head).  Thing about that next time you walk around.   


The other thing is that humans are really not in control. Humans can't solve climate change.  Not anymore. But, if it helps to believe, the so be it. But, don't begrudge those that see through the bull shit. Einhorn is correct. But, you never short faith. Faith has been around for tens of millennia.   


Anyways, have good day."

But leading people to go short on a stock like this, that only seems to go up, will lose them a lot of money. Posts on the accounting side of Tesla are merely grasps at straws in hopes for the company to not be as great as the “followers/supporters” say it is. It’s not only bad for the people that are tricked into shorting the stock but it’s also bad for the planet. Why hate a company that’s leading in sustainable transport and energy generation? Built from the ground up in America. I just don’t get it. I also don’t get why you wouldn’t be for autonomous vehicles which would save hundreds of thousands of lives and prevent so many fatal car accidents (which Tesla is also in the lead of).

2020-05-01 02:47:14,"[Paul Krugman BA (Yale) PhD (MIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman#Early_life_and_education) won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics. He was Economics Prof. at MIT and Princeton. [I reproduced the article below, if NYT pay-walled it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/opinion/economy-stock-market-coronavirus.html)

&gt; The economic news has been terrible. Never mind Wednesday’s [G.D.P. report](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-1st-quarter-2020-advance-estimate) for the first quarter. An economy contracting at an annual rate of almost 5 percent would have been considered very bad in normal times, but this report only captured the first few drops of a torrential downpour. More timely data show an economy [falling off a cliff](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WEI). The [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56335) is projecting an unemployment rate of 16 percent later this year, and that may well be an underestimate.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet [stock prices](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX), which fell in the first few weeks of the Covid-19 crisis, have made up much of those losses. They’re currently more or less back to where they were last fall, when all the talk was about how well the economy was doing. What’s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, whenever you consider the economic implications of stock prices, you want to remember three rules. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.
&gt; 
&gt; That is, the relationship between stock performance — largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear — and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent. Back in the 1960s the great economist Paul Samuelson [famously quipped](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/04/can-the-markets-predict-recessions-what-we-found-out.html) that the market had predicted nine of the past five recessions.
&gt; 
&gt; But I’d argue that there are deeper reasons for the current stock market-real economy disconnect: Investors are buying stocks in part because they have nowhere else to go. In fact, there’s a sense in which stocks are strong precisely because the economy as a whole is so weak.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul Krugman’s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy — and an even deeper look at what’s on Paul’s mind.
&gt;
&gt; What, after all, is the main alternative to investing in stocks? Buying bonds. Yet these days bonds offer incredibly low returns. The interest rate on [10-year U.S. government bonds](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10) is only 0.6 percent, down from more than 3 percent in late 2018. If you want bonds that are protected against future inflation, their yield is _minus_ half a percent.
&gt; 
&gt; So buying stock in companies that are still profitable despite the Covid-19 recession looks pretty attractive.
&gt; 
&gt; And why are interest rates so low? Because the bond market expects the economy to be depressed for years to come, and believes that the Federal Reserve will continue pursuing easy-money policies for the foreseeable future. As I said, there’s a sense in which stocks are strong precisely because the real economy is weak.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, one question you might ask is why, if economic weakness is if anything good for stocks, the market briefly plunged earlier this year. The answer is that for a few weeks in March the world [teetered](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system) on the edge of a 2008-type financial crisis, which caused investors to flee everything with the slightest hint of risk.
&gt; 
&gt; That crisis was, however, averted thanks to extremely aggressive actions by the Fed, which stepped in to buy an unprecedented volume and range of assets. Without those actions, we would be facing an even bigger economic catastrophe.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is, by the way, one reason you should be concerned about Donald Trump’s attempts to appoint unqualified loyalists, with a history of supporting [crank economic doctrines](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-03/which-judy-shelton-would-show-up-at-the-fed?sref=qzusa8bC), to the Federal Reserve Board. Imagine where we’d be now if the Fed had responded to a looming financial crisis the way the Trump administration [responded](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-trump-coverup.html) to a looming pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; But back to the disconnect between stocks and economic reality. It turns out that this is a long-term phenomenon, dating back at least to the mid-2000s.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about all the negative things we’ve learned about the modern economy since, say, 2007. We’ve learned that advanced economies are much less stable, much more subject to periodic crises, than almost anyone believed possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Productivity growth has [slumped](https://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm), showing that the information technology-fueled boom of the 1990s and early 2000s was a one-shot affair. Overall economic performance has been much worse than most observers expected around 15 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Stocks, however, have done very well. On the eve of the Covid crisis, the ratio of [market capitalization to G.D.P.](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/) — Warren Buffett’s favorite measure — was well above its 2007 level, and a bit higher than its peak during the dot-com bubble. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; The main answer, surely, is to consider the alternative. While employment eventually recovered from the Great Recession, that recovery was achieved only thanks to historically low interest rates. The need for low rates was an indication of underlying economic weakness: businesses seemed reluctant to invest despite high profits, often preferring to buy back their own stock. But low rates were good for stock prices.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I mention that the stock market is not the economy?
&gt; 
&gt; None of this should be taken as a statement that current market valuations are exactly right. My gut sense is that investors are too eager to seize on good news; but the truth is that I have no idea where the market is headed.
&gt; 
&gt; The point, instead, is that the market’s resilience does, in fact, make some sense despite the terrible economic news — and by the same token does nothing to make that news less terrible. Pay no attention to the Dow; keep your eyes on those disappearing jobs.

If you need evidence about buffet search Michael lewis article on warren buffet. He talks about him buying Solomon Brothers and how he talks about one thing and does another. (I don't agree with everything in the article, but he makes some valid points).

He mentions how a reporter wrote an article about Buffets mistress/second wife which he had the paper take out.

Buffet has an image, a mighty fine one. If you look carefully at what he does, has and has done it is sometimes very different from that image and what he says.

When you think of Warren buffet I'm sure you do not think of a man that married his wife's best friend because she left him. You dont think of a man who owns a California beach front property, Rolex watches, expensive suits and private jets because he told you he was so frugal and lives in the same house that he had at 30. You think he is a long term investor but has traded currencies. You think he is about society before profits, but bought Solomon Brothers by making a deal with the CEO who he indirectly criticized as being corrupt and leading a institution run by careless greed and diserving customer bases. 

The man's image is impeccable. He gets away with a lot. He says his favorite book was dale carinagie, ""How to Win Friends and INFLUENCE PEOPLE"" and it's worked.

This serves him well, not only in $ because people feel honored to sell at a lower price than normal to such a noble man but in that his reputation will surpass his wealth. He needs no more money, now it's just about legacy.

2020-04-30 20:35:14,"DPZ is something I've recently begun following as well. It's obviously a great business with a sexy consumer-facing story (some of which you've touched on), but much of the obvious upside seems already priced in and the current risk / reward is not immediately compelling. My initial impression of the situation is below -- apologies if any posters above have already mentioned, and discussion more than welcome.

First, and to your point, DPZ exhibits many obvious characteristics of great franchise models and, more generally, good businesses. DPZ is the industry leader in a resilient category: food tends to be defensive, and DPZ is further positioned at the value end of that spectrum. The business is capital efficient and highly scalable, with annuity-like CFs and meaningful growth opportunities available both domestically &amp; abroad. Like many successful franchisers, DPZ enjoys a marketing flywheel effect as a result of (i) systemwide advertising reinvestments and (ii) a sophisticated and well-capitalized franchisee base, which create a dynamic in which scale begets further scale. Furthermore, the company enjoys solid franchisee relationships and strong 4-wall economics (average U.S. unit has \~$350k startup cost, \~$140k EBITDA, and &lt;3yr payback).

Slightly more interestingly, DPZ benefits from several structural advantages that position it as a likely longer-term winner in food delivery. DPZ’s unique vertical integration (of supply chain, kitchen &amp; delivery), fortressing strategy, and tech infrastructure allow the company to consistently outcompete aggregators on the basis of delivery speed and price. Vertical integration enables smoother kitchen execution and allows DPZ to avoid hefty \~20-30% aggregator fees (which, in contrast, lead many competitors to raise prices on the delivery platforms); these cost savings are passed through to DPZ’s customers. Through fortressing, DPZ strategically positions its store base to increase delivery route density, which leads to faster deliveries, more satisfied drivers, and more profitable per-delivery economics. Various tech improvements (i.e., GPS tracking of drivers; ordering via Alexa / Google Home, etc.) over the years have helped drive throughputs and created more seamless customer experiences.

Although competition from delivery aggregators is currently a headwind, DPZ may also benefit from eventual “rationalization” of the landscape. The current environment is perceived as unsustainable since the platforms are generally pricing below cost. Potential catalysts such as greater investor pressure (perhaps resulting from DoorDash’s planned IPO), eventual reductions in funding (notably, DoorDash &amp; Uber Eats are both Softbank-backed), M&amp;A, and others should be industry positives. To the M&amp;A point, GrubHub has already undergone strategic review, although as an aside, I'm skeptical of acquirers’ ability &amp; willingness to pay (as someone unknowledgeable about the industry). Rationalization might not occur in the near-term but can be treated as a longer-term call option on the company.

Several other qualitative factors are encouraging and help justify value:

* DPZ has meaningful growth opportunities ahead. Independent players make up a significant portion of domestic &amp; global market share, suggesting presence of further white space. The #1 player in other QSR concepts (i.e., burgers) have higher global share than DPZ does in pizza (i.e., 25%+, relative to DPZ at \~20%), so there are precedents for growth beyond what DPZ has already achieved.
* DPZ owns its customer relationships (notably with 20mm+ members in its loyalty rewards program) and does not share data with aggregators or other third parties. This is a valuable data repository, potentially providing value creation opportunities that are legitimate but not immediately obvious to anticipate / quantify from an outsider's perspective.
* DPZ's recent pilot of its tech-enabled employee scheduling tool in Phoenix reduced a point of labor costs. This is another example of an opportunity that can be difficult to predict / quantify. However, given management's track record of integrating technology, further upside of this nature may exist.
* DPZ is likely an attractive takeout target if price sinks too low. Various consolidators show interest in the QSR space (i.e., 3G / QSR, JAB, Yum Brands), and DPZ has scarcity value as a proven global brand with a uniquely vertically integrated business model and attractive, consumer-facing digital assets.
* COVID-19 shutdowns should enable DPZ to widen its differential vs. smaller / independent operators.

However, these are all obvious business merits that investors fully appreciate in the current valuation. By my calculations, the current stock price (\~$360) assumes full realization of mgmt.’s 2025 guidance of 25,000 stores &amp; $25bn systemwide sales, with systemwide same-store sales comping at 5-6% over this time period (representing the upper range of mgmt.’s 3-6% guidance). These assumptions are likely overly optimistic given the persistent deceleration of DPZ’s domestic and international comps over the last few years.

I think 5-6% annual comp growth over the medium term is an unrealistic baseline for the domestic market. In the U.S., DPZ drives comp from mix shift and transaction growth (the company seldom raises prices), with the latter perceived by investors as the healthier of the two. Unfortunately, transaction growth has been stagnant (unsurprising given the maturity of the concept in the U.S.), with recent improvements short-lived: DPZ’s introduction of its loyalty program contributed 1-4% yoy transaction growth over 2018, but failed to have incremental positive impacts in 2019. Mix shift has been the sole source of SSS growth over the LTM, typically contributing only 1.5-3% yoy. Further headwinds from aggregators and the company’s own fortressing strategy should continue to persist over the medium term – these factors are already embedded in guidance, but I bring them up because they are unlikely to be sources of upside surprise. In other words, it seems unlikely that DPZ can consistently bridge to MSD domestic comp growth.

DPZ’s international segment is much trickier to analyze given its diversity of end markets. I don’t have a view on the international business, other than to say that DPZ seems unlikely to re-accelerate to MSD comps after having spent the last two years in LSD territory, especially when confronted with various idiosyncratic &amp; macro challenges in its larger markets. As a surface-level snapshot, DPZ has historically performed very well in India, its largest foreign market, but the country faces the dual challenge of a weakening economic environment (from pre-coronavirus) and severe food inflation. In the UK, the company’s second largest market, DPZ is contending with several issues including a long standoff with its franchisee base, driven by slowing growth and margin pressures; recent executive turnover; intense competition from aggregators; and historically poor execution in neighboring countries. Other core markets (Australia / New Zealand, Western Europe ex. UK) have seen similar deceleration in comps over the last two years.

So long story short – I think this is a good company / stock to own, but personally wouldn't buy in at \~$360. The stock can certainly realize further upside, but to be bullish at $360, you'd need high conviction in further upside beyond the lofty expectations already priced in."

He doesn't want to create envy in others so he makes it seem like he doesn't live in luxury or make money a top priority, but he does. Multiple times he has gone back on his word. Charlie is a better role model in this regard as far as I know.

As for him moving money to where is needed, again totally dissagree. He adds no value to society thorough investing (he admits this which is why he signed the giving pledge).He simply profits from undervalued mispriced opportunities. He is not funding start ups. Somebody is going to hold the business. He doesn't make anyone's life better (except his investors) by buying coke at $20 when it's really worth $40."

2020-04-30 18:43:02,"Let's dissect that.

Since inception, he's returned 9.6% gross, 5.1% net (annualized). That's a pretty decent track record. It's even better for the manager who's clipping 4.5% of AUM annually while taking zero personal risk, for arguably mediocre performance. This ain't no Rentec. You get those numbers when the manager is essentially issuing himself annual call options for free on a volatile portfolio. Put another way - taking 50% of the upside in fees is pretty fucking egregious.

Then, there's the portfolio. He says the median market cap was $150m at the end of '19 and $125m at the end of Q1. By my math, that's a 16% decline. In order to eke out a 37% decline with that portfolio, you were either levered with 100%+ gross or levered via options. That makes the return profile suspect - are you just looking at a 3x levered book that returns 5% annualized? Also, how investable is this mediocre book? As a non 13-D filer, you can get max positions of 5% across this book, so that's $7.5m (at $150m) per position. For a concentrated book (let's say 20 positions to be generous), that's a max allocation of $150m you can make to this manager.

I'm going to go on a limb and say this manager (like many who get their LPs from Reddit/Twitter) is just out to fleece unsuspecting mid-net worth individuals by charging high effective fees on a levered, volatile portfolio where he sells the mark with plausible stories about the underlying companies.

Also who said variance was bad..? We all want minimum downside variance but we all love upside variance. Simple optimizations fail to take this preference into account.

I find portfolio optimization a slippery slope, as a value investor I find myself correlating the weights of my portfolio in line with how undervalued a company is. For instance a company that is 300% undervalued will receive 6x the weighting than something that is only 50% undervalued. Because I only choose 1 stock per industry group my stocks typically carry a low correlation

I’ve learned MPT and read multiple papers and taken MS classes on the topic but the solutions will never be close to optimal in the long term. Unless you want to rebalance your portfolio consistently just stick to an easy model or idea."

I read the 10k. This company is a turn around story and its business model seems straightforward to understand. I feel like the auditor or management (who ever wrote the 10k) isn't a bull-shitter. 

Sounds like the local government is making life hard for these guys by forcing environmental  shutdowns.

Sounds like these local governments are disorganized. (Hard to believe they'll end being our benevolent overlords; Praise be Xi Jinpings and his alone)

Nice balance sheet. They have lots of cash, hardly any debt. They can pay all their liabilities with cash on hand, and still have about 60% of their cash left. The share count outstanding increased slightly YOY.

They have positive cash flow from operation. They don't expect to have to need to borrow or issue share to operate for the next year. They don't plan on dividends.

they are not profitable currently, but a lot of their capacity is still offline. I thought I read that bromine, for example, was only 25% production capacity utilized. Maybe they can get more production happening.

My main concern is that it could be a fraud. I don't trust the oversight of these companies. I have some BABA and I'm nervous about it. I think that a small cap chemical manufacturer in a random region of china is too much for me. I probably wouldn't sleep.

I also have some questions: Is this an ADR? what's this company doing being listed in US? Why do they have such a low amount of liabilities? Is that a cultural thing of china that I don't understand? I would've expected a company with a lot of factories and plants to have huge debts.

Overall, its an easy company to understand (i think...) and I think the financials warrant consideration. The main thing is that they pull off the turnaround."

I'm not one to time the markets, so my gut is to make some investments. I'll still have a very healthy cash position so it's nothing too far out on the risk spectrum (by my qualitative measure of risk), but I can't help but want to optimize. If that world of 3-7% inflation is coming, I really should be more patient. It's impossible for me to gauge if that's the world we'll be in or if the current sources of inflation are truly transitory like the Fed says."

The blog is pretty clear about the meaningful fallout portion of the equation. But unless I missed it, it didn't address the assertion that ""we are likely to eventually end up with high inflation"". Lots of people have been asserting this same thing since the GFC, and inflation (at least, consumer based inflation), was nowhere to be found.

In the spirit of inverting the thesis, is the expectation of increased inflation incorrect? If the helicopter money simply allows for consumer spending habits to remain the same despite unemployment, or even allows them to deleverage, that shouldn't affect inflation, correct? What would it take for inflation to take hold that is separate from the increase in consumer spending?"

2021-05-13 19:17:06,"The article is saying that this won't happen because what could drive prices is changes in cost of capital/liquidity.

This view is correct, although proving it is slightly convoluted. But if you look at countries that have bank-led financial markets (i.e. low allocation to equities at the aggregate level) then you find lower valuations generally, which kind of proves the point that there is not some objective value of a cash flow (you can look at M2/total household wealth for example, to get a picture of liquidity).

Either way, to return to your question, neither of these things will occur because the fundamentals of inflation likely don't matter. This happened in 1968, the market was scalding hot, valuations were very high...inflation starts, and the market prolapses until \~1974, it didn't matter that real assets were a hedge or whatever. No-one cared, they just sold.

It isn't clear where we are. The inflation of the 70s was the coincidence of multiple things at the wrong time. But 5%+ inflation seems possible given the political situation in the US. I don't think there is any easy way to outperform. I have been looking at natural resources seriously for the first time ever. But these stocks will likely get carried down too.

2021-05-12 17:35:56,"Great find and a great guide. I am a fan of Lyn and follow her on twitter.

I still think this project is worthwhile though.   


Lyn is writing a broad inflation guide with a few bits on hyperinflation, but hyperinflation is not the core focus. It is a more extreme beast. Let me illustrate with an example:

She writes ""Both gold and silver did exceptionally well in the 1970s inflationary period.""

  
In many of the hyperinflations I've looked at, governments ban and confiscate precious metals early on to save their currencies. So investing in gold is probably a bad idea over the long time (which during hp is pretty short)."
2021-05-12 13:40:58,"It's an interesting thought experiment to go back in history and ask yourself, ""What would or *should* I have done?""

For example, there were many issues in the markets before the crash of 1929. If you had excellent foresight, you might have started to sell things off around 1925 or 1926. The market would increase about 150% to the peak in 1929 from there. You might have felt like a damned fool during that period, but we know what was ahead... over the next 2-3 years, the S&amp;P500 would have declined about 80%.

Effectively, if you stayed out of the market from 1925 through 1931 or 1932, you'd have been given some **amazing** opportunities to make investments, at least if you really knew what you were doing and engaged in thorough research. 

But to be an investor and sit on your rear end for 7 years? That's not easy.

I haven't taken a lot of time to study Grantham's predictions, but your list makes it sound like he's just talking as rationally as one could. No one knows exactly when or why the markets will turn, but it sure it much easier to know when things are obviously cheap or obviously expensive. 

I have a feeling this is a bit of why Buffett has so much cash and why Munger talks about Warren's ability to ""sit around and not do too much"" as a quality. Opportunities don't always come when you have cash, but rather when others need it. The wait can be long and painful though."

2021-05-11 23:05:01,"Investing titan Jeremy Grantham made prescient calls about the bursting of bubbles in 2000 and 2008.


In an interview, he said the current market was eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble.


He also shared the four indicators that have lined up for the biggest wipeout of value. 



When Jeremy Grantham declared in January that ""the long, long bull market

since 2009 has finally matured into a fully fledged epic bubble,"" he said he knew there would be ""a substantial increase in crazy behavior"" before it all came crashing down. 

The cofounder of Boston's Grantham, Mayo, van Otterloo &amp; Co. is famous for having made prescient calls about the bursting of the 1989 Japanese asset-price bubble, the 2000 tech bubble, and the 2008 real-estate bubble.

""The thing about a bubble is if you can find more money and more crazy investors, it can keep going,"" he told Insider. 

As it played out, what Grantham saw in the fourth quarter as ""extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior"" escalated into even more remarkable events in the first quarter of this year. 

From the epic short squeeze in GameStop to the stratospheric rally of Dogecoin, the latest bout of market euphoria has even taken the spotlight away from special-purpose acquisition companies, which have raised $101.5 billion this year and secured $83.4 billion last year — more than the previous seven years combined. 
'This is eerily like 2000'

To Grantham, the tales of frenzy and mania today are eerily reminiscent of the tech bubble, but signs of cracks are already appearing in the SPAC market, where a sentiment shift, an oversupply, and regulatory scrutiny have led the IPOX SPAC Index down 23% from its February peak. 

Grantham, a Model 3 owner, said Tesla's price slump was another sign of the mania unwinding. The electric-vehicle maker's stock, which rose nearly eightfold in 2020, has fallen about 24% from its peak in January despite having delivered ""brilliant"" earnings results for the past two quarters.

""So this is eerily like 2000,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it might end tomorrow or just be a blip.""


In his view, the bursting of bubbles comes slowly and then all at once. For example, in 2000, the downfall started with Pets.com in March and then migrated to more respected small tech companies in April before hammering away midcap companies in June and Cisco — briefly the largest company — in July. 

By September, the tech sector, which had been 30% of the market, was down about 50%. But the S&amp;P 500 was unchanged, and investors started to dismiss what had transpired as a healthy rotation, Grantham said. 

""What it was really is the lack of confidence began to leak, not surprisingly, from those areas with the craziest amount of confidence where people had lost touch completely with any underlying fundamentals,"" he said. ""And then that spread through the system to merely enthusiastic stocks and finally reached the major market.""

Eventually, the music stopped entirely. In September, the 70% of the market that had not been affected rolled over and dropped 50% in the following two years. 

""It's like the termites that were nibbling away and working their way down,"" he said. ""When they covered enough ground slicing away like that, they stopped slicing and went for the rest of the market en masse.""
4 indicators have lined up 

This time, the combination of the massive fiscal-stimulus program and the effective rollout of vaccinations is likely to push the bubble to last longer, according to Grantham. 

But he doesn't think it will change the outcome where asset prices revert to a more reasonable level and investors enter a more pessimistic phase. ""What it means is the higher you go, the bigger the fall,"" he said. 

Grantham used the classic example of Japan, which inflated the biggest stock-market bubble of any developed country in the 1980s.

""At the time, everyone believed it was 65 times earnings,"" he said of the price-to-earnings ratio on the Nikkei. ""So that was just massive. The consequence is we are now 32 years later and the market is still not back where it was in 1989 in Japan.""

Similar to how Japan suffered from a ""lost decade"" of economic stagnation following the collapse of the asset-price bubble in 1991, another thing to consider in a bubbly environment is the negative-wealth effect, Grantham said. 

While the burst of the dot-com bubble dragged down the stock market, the net drag on the American economy was over pretty quickly. By comparison, the 2008 financial crisis affected not only Americans with stock portfolios but also ordinary homeowners who were sucked into the real-estate bubble. 

The housing market has become dangerously overheated once again, with multiple gauges of housing-market activity resembling their pre-2008 levels.

""Looking at the inventory of housing and looking at the availability of money sloshing around in the system,"" Grantham said, ""it is almost certain that, in the next few months, the US the housing market will pass the previous all-time high of 2006 and will establish a new high multiple of family income.""

Another indicator flashing warning signals is the bond market, which has become perhaps more expensive than stocks as a material chunk of global sovereign debt has negative yields, meaning that investors pay to lend governments their money. 

Aside from stocks, bonds, and real estate all being prohibitively expensive, commodities are also flashing warning signs. Driven by a global supply-chain shortage, commodities such as lumber, copper, steel, wheat, and cotton have all experienced huge price surges to reach multiyear highs. West Texas Intermediate crude oil had bounced back from minus $38 per barrel to about $65 as of Friday in just over a year. 

When commodity prices soar to record highs, the economy is vulnerable to a sharp contraction as consumers become more reluctant to make purchases and lofty prices of raw materials erode the margins of manufacturers. Specifically, surging oil prices were followed by recessions in every decade from the 1970s through the 2000s. A case in point is the 2008 oil shock, when oil prices hit $140 a barrel in the summer of 2008 from just $50 a barrel in early 2007.

To be sure, similar signs of asset-price bubbles are shooting up around the world, but ""in America, we have the real McCoy, we've got everything lined up,"" Grantham said.

2021-05-11 23:04:56,"I've been thinking more about this, and I've come to the conclusion that ephemeral aspects of management influence the story of the company. This in turn affects my estimation of how things might turn out. You can put that estimation into an expected value calculation. 

E.g. there's an 60% chance the company will take action A, leading to a value of $1 mil, and a 40% chance of them taking action B, where it'll be worth $500k. In this case, the EV is $800k. My judgement of management may lead me to conclude that action A is actually 80%, not 60%, so the EV would be higher.

Since only IPOs and secondary fund raises provide cash to companies, he's saying that ""if you stay within the stock investment class, you help send some of that money towards real investment""

This implies that companies should never return money to investors.  And then implies that we need to corrupt society into a bad investment for the good of society.

We can also notice that the corruption is failing if companies are paying more to investors (buybacks+dividends) than raising IPO investment.  According to author, its bad if investors get paid more than they put in.

Buffet/Munger's reasons for not investing in stores of value is actually a very good reason to invest in them when stocks are over valued at 22 PE.

Author also says something like:
&gt; The utility of bitcoin is the same at $100 ($2B market cap) as it is at $57k ($1.1T market cap).

This is obviously false, as the utility of bitcoin is capital mobility and liquidity.  This increases with value.  Btc is much more mobile than gold, but even at a lower total capitalization is already more liquid than gold in part due to its divisibility, but also ample markets and quick resell turnaround time option for accepting payment."

&gt;The Congressional Budget Office projects that in 20 years almost 30% of all yearly fiscal revenues will have to be used solely to pay back interests on government debt, up from a current level of 8%. More taxes simply won’t be enough to bridge the gap, so pressures **to monetize the deficit** will inevitably rise over the years. 

How do you monetize the deficit and what is bad about it?"
2021-05-11 06:36:17,"For me personally, I look at the size of the debt as creating a need for inflation and I think this need will ultimately push us towards policies that produce inflation.

The national debt must be serviced according to the terms on that debt. The debt is so large that tax revenue will need to increase in order for us to continue offering services at the same level we do currently. This revenue can either increase because it grows in real or nominal terms. I don't think real growth in tax revenue isn't going to provide enough tax revenue to service that debt and key services where they are, which means we'll probably see some inflation."

Pre-pandemic, just go back a few years... unemployment rates are low, interest rates are near 0%, big QE balance sheet at the Fed (adds liquidity to the markets as a result), widening government fiscal deficit in a period of economic expansion... and inflation wasn't there to be found.

Normally, those are all the right variables to create inflation. 

I think I agree that we (including economists) just aren't good at it. There are days where I have no clue if we're going to be living in a world of 3-7% inflation for the next decade or -1 to +3% indefinitely. I'm learning to just say, ""I have no darn clue.""

If VZIO's TV shipment volume has gone up by 61% from 2018 to 2020 but their market share dropped from 30% to 15%, this implies some ridiculous increase in the overall smart TV market size....which is not realistic at all. Lol did you run that math? Why is Statista even being used as a credible source? Someone else pointed to that same link, no one seems to have anything else to back this up.

Fair enough on TCL's foreign business...which once again, Vizio is not competing against? The ad business is North America focused, as is most of their hardware. So in the North American market, which is what we are talking about, Roku is capturing the economics of the smart OS for TCL.

I know the CBO measures potential GDP, but it’s not clear that’s what matters. Maybe what matters is slack in specific areas, depending on wherever the spending is directed to. And some of those measures of slack might not even just be domestic, but international. This means one country’s ability to run a deficit is dependent on what others do. You can’t all chase copper for example, but if others are not, then it’s easier to do so. I know this isn’t a great example, but I just generally agree that it depends on the scarcity of what you’re chasing. Inflation isn’t a guarantee, nor is the lack of it."

2.) They have multiple versions and the primary one is:  ""[Falcon Network Technology is responsible for development and operation of TCL's smart TV operating system.](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/tclelectronics/cpresent/pre210325.pdf)""  - You're forgetting, they're Chinese first.

Contributing to . . . euphoria are two further factors little noted in our time or in past times. The first is the extreme brevity of the financial memory. In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten. In further consequence, when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again, sometimes in only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and larger economic world. There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.

2022-05-25 12:23:43,"The article says they couldn't think of anything about position sizing: Kelly Criterion. That is it, that is the mathematically optimal size.

Equity investors are close to the worst at position sizing. I believe this is because they all do the CFA which teaches you nothing practical about actually managing money. Macro funds do this well, and most of them came from prop, not a CFA in sight (there are structural reasons for this too btw, but it is also cultural).

Either way, George Soros' autobiography is one of the best books on this subject. He followed his trades through a year. He was wrong about almost everything. Finished the year up 100%. It isn't only how often you are right but how much you make when you are right. 

So position sizing isn't only an expression of confidence (the idea of a ""best ideas"" funds therefore betrays logic) but something you take up and down based on: probability of outcome, and the gain/loss in each case...which is just Kelly.

Also, something to bear in mind is that the return on the average stock is negative, so it is very difficult to have a 50%+ win rate over any long period. And if you sell your winners quickly, it is almost impossible to make money. Equity fund managers have often made money despite terrible position sizing, because if something can move 10x then it doesn't matter if your initial size was off. This is also why you can make money with a portfolio of 100 stocks (I used to think this was impossible, but if you are investing in markets with a fat right tail...it is possible, I know an EM fund manager that ran 150+ stocks for decades and is up 1000% over benchmark. I know a global equities manager, they run close to $100bn now, they invested in FAST in 1990...that was it, firm got acquired, everyone made bank, partners are making $15-20m/year...a reputation built on one decision made by someone else, thirty years ago)."

“Personally, I was shocked to discover that only 49% of the very best investment ideas made money.

Even more shocking was that some of these legendary investors were only successful 30% of the time.

What really fascinated me was the fact that, despite some of them only making money on one out of every three investments, overall almost all of them did not lose money. In fact they still made a lot of it.”

Naturally, the rest of the book is about how this happened. And, as you might’ve guessed by now, what allowed these investors to do this was all about position-sizing – how they navigated the ups and downs of their ideas."

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;The long period of under investment in single family homes, combined with the strongest consumer balance sheets in modern history, has created an extreme shortage of housing inventory on a nationwide basis. We will continue to explore this topic with articles on demographics and demand, housing affordability and interest rates, our outlook for repair and remodel spending, and lastly a look at some individual stock picks to express our views."

If you started to call a bubble or had concern with how banks were structured in 1925, you would have been right, but the peak wasn't until 1929, and the market bounced back in the following year. But what laid ahead were years of declines. Judging someone on a short term outcome, which can be as long as a decade, isn't easy in my opinion. I try to pass less judgement but use their views as something to absorb and learn from. Grantham got Japan and dot-com bubble right, and so I give him some credit. Shiller got the dot-com and housing bubble right, and his latest long term expectation on interest rates as a bit of irrational exuberance has been out for years without being right. It doesn't mean he's right or wrong.

There are some business specific situations where I come to the conclusion that it could blow up once every 20 or 30 years, and so I have to avoid it the whole time, because I don't like that risk. Would I be wrong for saying this risk, even if the stock keeps going up every year?"

2022-05-20 09:27:50,"My favorite corollary to this is from Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville:

&gt; Here is what ‘Adam Smith’ — after I told him about Walter — wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

&gt;He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s about it.

In introducing me to (Schloss) Warren had also, to my mind, described himself. ‘He never forgets that he is handling other people’s money, and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.’ He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real — and from this flows an attraction to the ‘margin of safety’ principle.

&gt;Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does. He doesn’t worry about whether it it’s January, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks than I do — and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the business; I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter. That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him."

2014-08-02 22:38:13,"The article fails to discuss an extremely important thing which a lot of details came out in the Apple/Samsung lawsuit which is the vast majority of the sales were from the lowest end Galaxy phones pushed by carriers (think equivalent to ~iphone 3G?).  The idea that people are going out in droves and buying the flagship phones (S5 etc) is a myth, a very well done one I admit by the Samsung marketing guys.  So any analysis of Samsung needs to look at the sales to carriers, not to consumers.  Samsung's profit comes from carriers pushing low end product to consumers who don't really care and it is the carriers that Samsung tries to please.  Why do you think Samsung is trying so hard to replace Android?  As long as they are just an Android device their buyers (aka carriers) can just go to the next company that will sell them a cheaper Android clone that they can give away for ""free"" with a two year contract.

2014-07-31 14:19:20,"Conceptually, you are right and have likely nailed the answer. However, what about in practice? I've never looked at this, but I would suspect that within certain bounds of the risk free rate, a rising rate might be associated with a falling equity risk premium. That is to say, the ERP may not have the same sensitivity in magnitude or even directionally when we go from 0% to 3% vs. 5% to 8%. The same can be said for the other direction for rates. Thoughts?"
2014-07-31 12:05:29,"Whoops meant to be writing MR as in market return, and not MRP. thanks"
2014-07-31 06:16:51,"Answered that way in the follow up to him. But that's also an assumption (though most likely correct). Friendly reminder, the equity risk premium = mrp (market risk premium)."
2014-07-31 01:39:03,That's incorrect - if you're given an equity risk premium instead of MR then increasing RF will always increase cost of equity. It doesn't have an inverse relationship 
2014-07-31 01:37:40,"The question does have a guaranteed income. Put it another way - one of the rules of thumb is that the cost of equity is always higher than cost of debt. That makes sense, right? Equity has more risk that debt (no guaranteed repayment, stake might be worthless, last stakeholder in liquidation line)

If the RF rate goes up, the cost of debt goes up. The spread on debt starts with RF rate  (treasury spot rate) + credit risk premium + option premiums + other (liquidity, etc). So by that logic you can conclude that the cost of equity will go up as well, because non distressed debt will never be riskier than common equity 99% of the time.

Another perspective is to look at it from the equity investor side - CAPM gives you the minimum return you need for the transaction to make sense. If you can get 10% holding treasuries (RF), you would never take on the risk of equity that also yields 10%. If RF increases, you expect more compensation for bearing equity risk. CAPM also works as rf + b (equity risk premium), which mathematically would never decrease as RF was increased. "

2014-07-31 00:30:37,"Re-read the question. It's not *only*, it's what will **most likely** happen. There's not a lot of guarantees in finance. Conceptually, if the risk free rate increases both cost of debt and cost of equity will increase as the Market Risk Premium (the amount of reward investors demand to assume risk; the 20-10%=10% or 20-15%=5% in your example) would like stay constant and cause both costs to increase.


"
2014-07-30 23:39:27,Then how can the question have a guaranteed outcome?  I.e. isn't it wrong for the answer to be that an increase in Rf will lead *only* to an increase in cost?
2014-07-30 21:18:26,"I just want to note that unlike Watsa, Klarman's team doesn't take into consideration market valuations at any point when making decisions."
2014-07-30 16:41:39,"If you're holding everything equal then it would work in this case mathematically. Conceptually though I think it's the wrong approach to look at it. CAPM is trying to measure the minimum amount of return required based on the RF + compensation per additional amount of risk. 

The reason the yield lowers under CAPM is because of the smaller equity risk premium. 15% is guaranteed so you're only multiplying 5% by beta as opposed to 10% initially. Practically you wouldn't hold beta/mrp constant. Also if you used an average ERP then CAPM would be higher when you increased RF (since you wouldn't be subtracting 15%, but using a constant #).

If you use another formula (like the build up approach) you would start with the RF rate, and add an equity risk premium + other premiums. So 2 companies with the same risk would require the same yield. And if it was 1 company at two different points it would require a higher yield given a higher RF rate.

You can check out the portfolio mgt theory reading on the SML (security market line) for more info about market premium (starting with RF rate) plotted against risk (represented by beta). An increase in RF would just shift the line up

2014-07-30 15:10:32,"Greenblatt maintains his own database of adjusted financials and then applies quantitative rules. So I guess his strategy is more of a hybrid instead of a strict quantitative strategy:

&gt;Dasaro: Joel, your funds follow a systematic fundamental value weighting strategy. What do investors get when they pay for active management in your funds?

&gt;Greenblatt: Well, we do fundamental research bottom-up in our long/short funds of roughly the 2,000, large and mid-cap range, or maybe the 2,000 largest companies, somewhere in that area. And we go through every balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, making our adjustments as to what we think the difference between what their reporting and what economic reality is.

Then, we're ranking companies based on our measures of absolute relative value of companies. I have a partner, Rob Goldstein, who's been with me since 1989, and that's the only way we know how to value companies--measures of absolute and relative value--and we rank them from 1 to 2,000, based on their discount to our assessment of value.

My knee-jerk reaction to this question is that for many companies - and especially ones that are apt to be mispriced - GAAP/IFRS may not accurately reflect the economics of the business. Much of the time, you cannot take the financial statements at face value; adjustments need to be made; line items may need to be added back to net income to achieve a more realistic ""adjusted ROIC""...

These decisions are different for each company and situation. Any attempt to computerize will have to ignore these differences and will therefore be ineffective.

And honestly, this natural resistance to automation is a big reason I'm personally drawn to value investing as a superior long-term investment strategy. The less ""efficient"" the process is, the more opportunities will be available over my lifetime.

2014-07-29 13:36:44,"I use a different discount method that I found in Pat Dorsey's book 5 Rules to Successful Investing.  It's a little complicated to explain, and honestly I should go back and reread the chapter to make sure I have everything in excel setup properly.  

With the stock I had plugged into the calculator already, MCO, a inputing 11% for the discount and 2% for the perpetuity growth rate yields a stock value of $74.78.  Using 9% and 4% respectively, yields a result of $106.64.  Which I agree is a wide swing.

But... a 4% perpetuity growth rate is pretty high.  Youre essentially assuming the company will outgrow the US economy by 33%...forever. 

So again, Id recommend using 3% for the perpetuity growth rate.  As for the discount rate, Mr. Dorsey recommends using 10.5% as an average.  12% for risky companies.  9% for safe companies.  

Then, dont forget to apply a huge Margin of Safety to your stock purchases.  The idea isnt to buy stock that are slightly undervalued.  The idea is to buy stocks that are majorly undervalued.  (By 25% of more)  That way, even if you did put in the wrong percentage point here or there, you're still going to be fine. 
"
2014-07-29 13:34:17,"True, but personally im not a bond guy. I understand the concept etc. Im just more focused on equity since im young. Probably a bad move on my part since i should just be looking for great deals anywhere."
2014-07-29 13:19:36,"If you're a value investor, I assume you have a strong conviction regarding ""margin of safety"" and the importance of being conservative. As WhatsYourModel said, working capital changes are for factoring in sales growth. However, sales growth is risky. The conservative investor doesn't buy growth. Should growth happen to occur, your valuation was lower than expected, and thus are pleasantly surprised. If growth doesn't occur, hey, you already anticipated that, so no ugly surprises. That's why I don't include changes in working capital into my free cash flow equation: Better to be roughly right rather than precisely wrong.

FWIW, I calculate FCF as Net Income + Depreciation &amp; Amortization + Other Non cash charges - (Capital expenditures + Acquisitions). Pretty much Buffett's ""owner earnings"" except for the inclusion of acquisitions."
2014-07-29 13:09:31,The chapter on bonds is still timely.
2014-07-29 09:41:03,"But isn't your assumed 3% or 2% an input to a terminal value equation, which is an E / (r - g) ?

He's just pointing out that if what you pick for r and g is even a tiny bit off from what you should have picked, you can get a drastically different terminal, and so a drastically different NPV, and so you think you're getting a stock for 50% off when in fact you're paying full value (or worse).

Or maybe you're looking at this differently than NPV?"
2014-07-29 08:55:36,So dont use Greenwalds method.  I would just use the rate of GDP growth (3%) for 10 years for standard industries.  2% for dying industries.
2014-07-29 07:01:27,"I still don't think that matters.  

Channeling Greenwald, if you assume cost of capital is 10%, world GDP growth is 3%, the correct multiple to pay for the terminal is 1 / (.1 - .03) = 14x

But maybe you're off by 1% on each, then the proper multiple could be:
 1 / (.11 - .02) = 11x

...or 1 / (.09 - .04) = 20x

Even with tiny errors in assumptions we already can't tell if the terminal value should be X or 2X."
2014-07-29 05:53:27,"Yes. Specific types of Value Investing can be handled by computers and others can't. 

Computers are great at handling discrete, rule based operations. As such, value investing strategies that are focused around more quantitative aspects of investing employ computers heavily. Strategies like Net-Nets, low P/B, low P/E and other financial statement approaches are heavily automated and employed as basket approaches. Other value strategies combine factors or use more novel strategies in their quantitative value approaches. For more detail examine:

* Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Funds
* Wesley Gray of Alpha Architect
* Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates

On the other hand, computers are bad at thinking conceptually. There was an article a few days ago about the effort that Google is putting into their cluster of servers that acts as an artificial brain. It took a number of years of manual training by humans before it could recognize addresses in Google Maps Street View Photos. How long would it take for that computer to recognize a commodity industry that has consolidated to the point where oligopolistic pricing is possible? How long would it take for a computer to recognize that a post BK company is selling for less than liquidation value when comps trade at a multiple of earnings? How many humans know how to do this analysis? How many examples would you have to show the computer before it understood categorically what to look for and examine? 

These and other types of situations that are discovered qualitatively rather than quantitatively, are the ones where human analysts will have an edge for the forseeable future."

1. It's a commodity industry (I don't think ""Rick's"" has any particular brand value, but I'm not one for strip clubs, so I could be wrong on this)

2. Is management good? I imagine strip clubs, even of this size, can attract shoddy people. On that note...

3. Regulatory risks? The U.S. seems to be getting more prudish, and I don't think guys in their 20s like strip clubs as much as guys in their 50s now liked them 30 years ago. Again, I could be wrong.

Those are the only things that come to mind. Top line growth is phenomenal, EPS is healthy, margins are good--it definitely does deserve a higher P/E just looking at financials. But I think there's more to study here."

I use number crunching algos to screen stocks. The valuation needs creativity and reflection to be valid - esp. for good and great businesses (durability and size of economic moats matters a lot).

Last but not least, algos are dangerous if you do not know their limits! The housing bubble was caused (in part) by risk-models of rating agencies, which had false assumptions about the correlation of credit defaults."

So, right off we (""we"" being members of ""this elite group"") can assume there exists an incredulous eye judging everything said.  Yet, I remain undeterred.

We have algorithms to do all of this.  None of it is terribly difficult at all.  Plug in the numbers and - voila - a complete readout of relevant metrics, ratios, projections, etc.  Practically limitless knowledge and information.

Unfortunately, the question we must ask is:  *where is the wisdom?*  It is not enough to say that ""X is relatively cheaper than Y,"" not by a long shot.  

Financial markets are highly dynamic.  Values depend as much upon intrinsic properties as they do upon the highly variable values placed upon things by financial market participants.  This is important because we're discussing *relative value* here, not fundamental mispricings (which themselves are almost easier to pick out).  "
2014-07-28 14:25:41,You mean genix fund? Looking for good examples of automated analysis/screening for value investing.
2014-07-28 13:29:38,"Because every value investor and every value play is different. You can screen stocks for low P/B and low P/E ratios with consistent earnings but with instances like special situations and even GARP plays you can't really program a computer to look for things like that. 

My broker has a value screener that is horrid, it is programmed to look for specific traits but it can often rank some interesting companies as ""overvalued"". Some value plays are valuable because they don't screen well. 

I think value investing is more of an art than a science, it requires an active human being thinking and reasoning with investment theses and ideas. 

I think computers can be useful but they definitely require some human oversight and due diligence. "

2014-07-26 20:19:14,"You can do this by segmenting the business units, finding the drivers for each, and getting information from the previous quarterly/annual reports as well as investor presentations and quarterly conference calls. Sometimes you also have to use primary research to get the information to understand unit economics.

For example, you can look at Royal Hawaiian Orchards (NNUTU). This is one of my investments and they provide enough information to break the business into its component parts. There are more than three significant things that drive revenue and costs: Macadamia harvest yields, cost per lb of macadamia nuts, labor costs, whether the product is sold to Mauna Loa, bulk, or retail, and how quickly the business can turn inventory. However, all of this information is provided in publicly available areas, and if you're good at modelling, you can use these drivers to determine a range of prices for this company that makes sense.

I've done my work on this already. Let me know if you'd like more detail."

Value investments pop up unexpectedly, just like real life - and when they do you often get 30-40% ROI expectations. So it's okay to miss one or even two years of opportunities. You don't buy a pair of socks every year hoping to achieve a desired price; you wait for a sale to reveal itself before buying. The same mindset should apply to stocks as to socks. Don't sacrifice quality in chasing that extra percentage point."

Personally, I beileive the US markets and CND markets are becoming even more attractive to the global capital at this time because of the uncertainty in Europe and the slowdown in China. After this next 1-2 years im turning my positions to cash and waiting for corrections. 

If your not comfortable with O+G then I would advise a low risk LT bond until there are some deals in the market.

2015-02-02 16:52:04,"This is basically right, except the key thing to keep in mind is that giving employees stock in return for their labor (whether as part of 401k or otherwise) is BOTH a cost and a dilution.  Though  company guidance in most cases will try to convince you otherwise.

It's a dilution as it raises the share count.  It's a cost, as the company could have 'given' that same amount of stock to public markets in return for its approximate market value -- so the cost to owners of the firm is the approximate market value of the stock given out.  

--
A couple other reasons for company's contributing stock to 401(k)s.

1) it supposedly incentivizes employees to act more like shareholders.

2) In lot of cases when a company offers stock to public markets, it leads the stock price to decline (mostly, it is said, due to information asymmetries, whereby the market infers the company wouldn't sell its stock unless it was richly priced).  This doesn't occur with employee stock based comp for whatever reason, so doing a match in a 401k is backdoor way of accessing equity markets.

2013-07-16 23:35:48,"You mentioned prostatectomies, and it's my impression that this makes a decent chunk of the DVSS segment, although maybe this was just initially important. The following $0.02 hinges on that assumption, so forgive me if that is not entirely accurate. 

Right now there is a huge over-treatment of prostate cancer because there is no good diagnostic test to determine the strength of the cancer, essentially if it is slow or if it's fast. More often than not (don't know the exact %), it's a slow grower, but determining this is not feasible atm. I don't have the study in front of me, but I've read that the complications that arise from this over-treatment out-weigh the benefits, but that most patients prefer to directly treat it than to take a monitor-and-wait approach. It's not outside the realm of possibility that personalized, genomic testing improves to the point of seriously correcting this over-treatment, which would presumably be an unpleasant headwind for DVSS. There is also the fact that there is greater reimbursement to be had in an extended, monitored approach (although robotic surgeries maintain higher reimbursement rates when compared to their traditional counter-part, as I understand it). "
2013-07-16 11:47:26,"Here are the assumptions I'm making:

1. US DVSS sales will continue to fall due to decreased hospital capital spending.

2. International DVSS sales will continue to grow as penetration in those markets is very low.

3. DVSS procedure share will continue to grow (and thus IA sales will continue to grow) as doctors that currently use the system will continue to do so and medical school students will continue to be trained on the DVSS. Combine those factors with secular population trends and you'll continue to see procedure growth.

4. At some time within the next year, revenue growth will be driven by International DVSS sales and IA sales rather than by US DVSS sales.

The investment thesis hinges most closely on assumption #1. I don't know how severe the drop in US DVSS sales will be or how long it will continue. I think the sales will normalize at a new lower growth rate. If that occurs, then the stock should start rising again once YOY comparisons are easier in 2014. I could speak with some hospital directors, surgeons, and medical school students to see how they think about the situation.

Either way, the time to buy ISRG is not right now. You'll see how everything plays out over the next 2-3 quarters.

"
2013-07-12 22:55:55,"I think the main problem with asking people on this thread about TSLA valuation is that TSLA is currently better classified as a growth stock, where much of the value is believed to derive from very high growth in revenue and earnings in the future that would justify a very high price for the company you're paying for right this moment. My guess is that very few members of this subreddit have experience or the required technological know-how for them to be comfortable investing in this company in the first place.

Like most others on this site, I know almost nothing about technology companies on the edge of development like TSLA and I think that whatever specifics I predict about TSLA's stock or earnings performance in the future based on current forecasts will probably be wrong. TSLA's market cap is about $15B at the moment, and my guess is that investors will want the company to become at least as large as Toyota is right now, which would be about a 1300% return. I think that's a good ceiling, maybe double that if people are lucky. But how likely is that?

With that all in mind, one of TSLA's benefits is that it's a first-mover. Although TSLA has a first-mover advantage, that hasn't stopped companies in other industries from eating each others' lunches over the history of business.  Technology, brands, and products can be replicated, improved upon, or just plain stolen by a more cutthroat competition. Ironically, TSLA itself is named after a guy who got the short end of the stick from Thomas Edison, and Edison's company (General Electric) is still one of the largest companies in the world right now. There are several massive competitors in the car market that TSLA will have to hold off or utterly demolish in the coming years in order to grow into a leading car company with an established worldwide brand, and I don't think the other car companies will play nice.

What makes TSLA especially scary to me as an investment is that even if TSLA's 10 year plan, or whatever it is, goes off without a hitch and it becomes an industrial giant like the other car companies, it's STILL a car company. This makes super-TSLA a cyclical stock like all the other car companies. A cyclical company depends heavily on how the current economic cycle is doing for its margins, product demand, profits, and growth. Each of these factors can move wildly over the course of 5-10 years. Thus, a cyclical company's valuation problem is compounded by the need to keep quarterly/monthly watch of the macro economy to make sure the cycle doesn't make a surprising turn. As a cyclical stock investor, you need to sell before the majority of shareholders realize a bust in the cycle is going to happen and you're left holding the bag. For me, the amount of speculative game theory required to play this kind of earnings game is enough to make my head spin. But if you really want to play ""the growth-and-cyclical-stock-trading-musical-chairs-game,"" a great reference on cyclical and growth stocks is Peter Lynch's ""One Up on Wall Street"".

Thus, I don't really value TSLA to be more than the $15B it's currently trading at. The risks and uncertainty in a long-term or short-term investment are large enough to discount the value of TSLA's predicted future cash flows to less than $15B."
2013-07-12 19:55:43,"[This thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i4gh6/is_tsla_still_a_good_buy/) is going on in investing.

The other point that no one seems to mention is competition. There are several other manufacturers that have deep pockets and can enter the electric car business. Now the common response would be that Tesla has first mover advantage. But does that really matter in a few years? There's nothing so complicated that Toyota et al can't make (electric motors have been around forever, car frame and other components are similar to existing, etc). Not that Tesla won't sell cars, but the others will too. So it won't be a slam dunk for Tesla, which most would say they need to justify this price. "

They can do the other stuff eazy. That coupled with the fact that I don't see competition anywhere near Tesla gives me the impression that Tesla is still a great buy even at its current price..."
2013-07-12 17:29:42,"Let me start by saying that TSLA is well past the ceiling of a rational assessment of fair value. I know I won't get as detailed as you want because psychology not fundamentals is driving the current stock price. 

When valuing a stock I always start by answering the question, ""Is it cheap?"". The answer to this question is a resounding no when looking at TSLA. Analyst EPS estimates for this year are negative and TSLA is trading for 8x 2013 revenue. For 2014, TSLA is trading at 150x EPS. These are multiples for early stage tech startups that distribute product through the internet and aren't touting building 400 units per week. The type of startups that can expand their user base by millions in a month.

At this point in time, I'd stop examining the stock and look somewhere else for bargains, but I'll go a bit further. You want to invest in securities where negative sentiment is working in your favor to make people ignore great fundamentals.

It's always helpful to run thought experiments and examine unit economics to judge whether expectations priced into the stock are rational. As a though experiment, look at Fiat. They own Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Ferarri, Maserati, and also sell agricultural vehicles and other things. They sold 4.2M vehicles last year and their market cap is $9.3B. TSLA will sell 20-25k vehicles this year and their market cap is $15B. Does that make sense? It doesn't.

What this discrepancy means is that the future expectations for TSLA are absurdly high. They not only have to kill it with the model S, but also with their hatchback that is supposed to come out next year, and get massive adoption with their mass market vehicle that is 3-4 years away. In order for this to happen, they have to increase capacity at their plant, build out a network for recharging their vehicles, and greatly eat into the marketshare of GM, Toyota, Ford, BMW, Audi, Mercedes Benz, and other car makers.

I'm not saying that this can't happen, I'm saying that's what's already priced in. TSLA has to do better than that for you to see a return on your money. Now Elon Musk is way smarter than me, and a better entrepreneur than me, but if any of those milestones slip, the stock will take a nasty hit. I'm not going to bet my money on a situation where abnormal outperformance in priced into the stock 5+ years in the future. I don't think you should either.

2013-07-12 17:17:34,"I think it's nearly impossible to put a value on Tesla (the current price is far beyond what most would consider fair value for a true investment), but [it looks like someone tried](http://www.caseyresearch.com/cdd/what-is-tesla-motors-worth). "
2013-07-12 11:01:42,"ISRG has the potential to be a uniquely special situation in 1-2 quarters depeding on how things develop. Briefly, here's how I view the situation:

da Vinci Surgical System (DVSS) unit sales decreases in the US alone are the reason for this revenue miss. While robot unit sales fell 27% in the US when comparing YOY quarters, international robot sales were up 100%.

ISRG has 2 revenue streams: DVSS Sales and Instrument/Accessory (IA) Sales. This year is the first year that IA revenue will exceed DVSS revenue. IA revenue grew 18% when comparing quarters YOY, but that wasn't enough to meet expectations.

ISRG has a huge moat. Surgeons aren't usually quick to change how they perform procedures. However, the DVSS occupied a place in the consumer's mind where the shiny new tech was better (Research shows that the DVSS not only isn't better, but is more expensive than traditional laparoscopic procedures). The end consumers actively sought out hospitals/doctors that performed surgeries with the DVSS (prostatectomies initially). Doctors that could use the DVSS made more money. Hospital directors were afraid of losing share of procedures in their cities, thus an arms race was created. I remember reading this article years ago:

http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2007/02/da-vinci-uncoded-or-surgical-robots.html

Now, the DVSS has an absurd share of urological and gynecological surgeries in the US. ISRG are continually adding to the list of surgeries this machine can be used for and trying to get doctors to increase robot utilization. This prevents other surgical robots from taking hold in niches that could eventually be used to attack other surgical markets.  Additionally, ISRG has these robots in all of the top tier medical school hospitals where the next generation surgeons are trained. Once they've gotten used to using these robots, getting them to go back to laparascopes is going to be difficult to say the least.

Here's what I hope to happens. Hopefully, US robot sales completely shits the bed and international DVSS sales and IA sales continue to chug along. Eventually, the stock price will hit a point where price implied expectations don't reflect the growth in international robot sales and instrument/accessory sales (The market tends to look at sales in aggregate instead of looking at different business lines). If this happens it will occur in the 2 quarters. Then in 2014, the stock will appreciate do to easier YOY comparisons and the US DVSS sales normalizing at a new lower rate. The stock will be driven by international uptake of DVSS systems in the future.

I've put a reminder in my calendar to check back up on this stock in November. It's like IRBT all over again. Until then, ISRG is on my watch list. If they turn this around faster than this I'll miss the boat.

2013-07-11 22:00:36,excellent.
2013-07-11 10:34:54,"First, let me point out that I do no do this for a living.  There are a lot of intelligent people on this sub who have a far better understanding of this stuff.  That being said...

I think if you understand the basic business model of mREITs than you start to see why falling bond prices affect them so much.  This can probably be more intelligently described so I defer to those who likely no a lot more on this sub.

Their business plan is to take cash then buy mortgages from Freddie and Fannie.  This is significant because these mortgages are ""backed"" by the US government making them higher quality mortgages.  They then use these mortgages as assets to take out short term loans at low short term interest rates.  They use the proceeds of these short term loans to buy more long term mortgages...essentially leveraging their position.  They are then making money in the difference between their short term borrowing costs and the rate of return on the mortgages.  

Over the past couple of years they have been in an interesting position.  Short term yields have been very low which has made their cost basis very low.  At the same time, however, mortgage yields were going down as the Fed kept buying up mortgages to keep rates low.  This presumably lowered the revenue stream.  While the fed purchasing was a bad thing in part because it lowered mortgage yields, I THINK (still trying to understand all of this)... I THINK the Fed buying was also, in part, a good thing for them because it raised the asset value of the mortgages they had on their books so in turn they could borrow more money and leverage themselves to make more money.  Think of it this way, they essentially bought a house with cash, then took out a mortgages on that house, and bought another house, and then the price of both of their houses was going up because everyone was buying houses, so they could take out bigger mortgages to buy more houses...and on and on.

Now, kind of like with the housing crash ruining the purchasing power of the common homeowner who used their house as collateral, NLY has issues because the Fed has said they will start selling these mortgages.  So the assets they have been using to leverage themselves is decreasing.  In the short term, they need to make sure they have sufficient collateral.  Remember that they get their cash to buy mortgages using short term loans. This means that they are constantly having to take out new loans...they are constantly having to re-up their collateral.  Their problem is that every time they go back to get a new short term loan, their collateral (the long term loan mortgages) is not worth as much.  They have to either come up with more collateral or take out less short term loans.  This is a, potentially, a BIG problem for their business model.

Herein is, what I THINK, is the short term problem for NLY.  Their assets are decreasing in value rapidly, thus decreasing the ""book"" value of the business.  Additionally, they can't continue to buy mortgages (their revenue stream) because they dont have the cash/assets to do it.  Thus their revenues will either remain stagnant or decrease.  They are stuck, in the short term.  They cant but new mortgages with higher rates.  So they have to wait until their existing mortgages get paid off so that they can use the proceeds from those mortgages to start buy new higher yielding mortgages.  Eventually, so long as they dont get squeezed to hard,  they will be fine and be able to buy newer higher yielding mortgages.

The question is...will they make it?  And if they do, how much will this squeeze shrink their purchasing power and thus their profit making power?

So to answer your questions:

1) It is difficult to know when to buy because it is difficult to determine the book value of the company.  Rarely is a company's book value as volatile as this.  So if you are trying to buy at a discount to book value, you may buy at a discout today, however two weeks from now, you may have paid a premium because the asset values of the company's balance sheet are devaluing at such a high rate.

2) Short term rates are the costs of mREITs.  Long term rates are the revenues of mREITS.  The steeper the curve, the better.  HOWEVER, you can not forget the fact that these companies are do leveraged.  If you look at the earnings call from this past quarter for NLY, you will see that the CEO says NLY has enough spare equity that they can absorb the decreasing asset values (so as not to cause them to deleverage themselves out of profitability.)  Rather, the CEO says that these situations are ideal for NLY because their costs (short term yields) remain low while revenues are increasing (long term yields.)

At the end of the day, I am not smart enough to know whether their equity is sufficient or not so I am waiting until the next earnings release August 1."

Doctor/Patient relationships are being addressed regardless of what technology is being brought into the folder, but the understanding with these new technologies like robotic arms is that you can now be in a hospital with no expert in, say, neurology, and still get a world renouned neurologist to do your surgery.

That to me is the future."
2013-07-11 03:32:58,"You clearly know your stuff here. I've been looking at AGNC for a couple weeks considering a buy given the serious discount to book and attractive dividend yield (although it seems prudent to expect that dividend to fall). A couple questions:

1) Would you tell me why NOT to buy?

2) Exactly how do rising interest rates affect these guys? Does the speed of interest rate increases affect them particularly? What about the steepness of the yield curve? How does that affect them?

2013-07-11 01:24:30,"I'm not an expert on this equity, but how do you justify the cost/benefit of a machine like this when the entire HC/hospital landscape is being forced to recapitulate the doctor-patient relationship from the ground up? It seems like even hospitals that *might* be interested in this device have a million other things to worry about first."
2013-07-10 23:03:41,"One thing that stands out to me in the article is where it says:

&gt;Investors have been overcompensating in selling REIT stocks while preparing for bond prices to fall further, according to Steven Delaney, an analyst in Atlanta at JMP Securities LLC. That’s increased the discounts to net values of REIT holdings, or book values, at which the shares trade.

&gt;On July 5, companies that invest in only government-backed bonds were trading at 88 percent of current book values on average, he said. Whether to buy the shares depends mainly on the direction of mortgage-bond prices, which may be set for new sharp moves with Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke speaking today in Boston, he said.

That last sentence is the most important.  The book values in the quarterly reports are so irrelevant at this point.  Even if you did calculate a new book value today, the mortgage market's extreme volatility renders such a calculation irrelevant within a few days.  

As for the valuation and negative sentiment, I have no doubt that these REITS have the potential to be over sold.  Likely, many investors were chasing the huge yields of mREITs and bought them up in the otherwise low yield equity/bond markets.  Then the Fed comments were made in May and the company was likely sold by institutional investors due to the confirmed imminent uncertainty of mREITS profitability.  Individual investors likely piled on as they became afraid of a plummeting share price. This mentality of the market could, or has already, created excessive downward pressure.  That's what we like to see.

Another issue, quasi-related to the article, is the comments made by NLY's CEO in the last earnings call.  In hindsight they seem overly optimistic that the Fed would continue buying mortgage securities.  This is the last part of the [call transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1393891-annaly-capital-management-s-ceo-discusses-q1-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=4&amp;p=qanda&amp;l=last) where the CEO seems to think, well in his words he hopes, that the Fed will not change it course until unemployment reaches 6.4%.  He also seems to be banking on the Fed's inability to make an exit.  

The CEO is asked about how NLY's portfolio is positioned to absorb the Fed's exit.  He points out that they have been raising equity in anticipation of the exit creating opportunities.  The question at this point is whether that equity is enough to absorb the Fed's exit.

Whether he is correct or not, we shall see.  New earnings come out August 1.  

Clearly there is a value opportunity that is being created.  The valuation issue is the immense amount of leverage and that leverage's effect on book value.  As value investors, we are used to book value being a rather stagnant number.  This is clearly not the case here.

I would be interested in your thoughts if you have been paying attention to this area.  I am a lay person (non-professional) investor, so I am sure my analysis is flawed.  I'm interested in your critiques."

2013-07-10 15:27:36,"Thanks for your input. It has made me think about the focus of the sub.

This is my current reasoning about the project. 

I focus on quality of information - primary sourcing or direct reports avoiding blog reportage or secondary/tertiary  reporting or self posts or tirades and most politics .

The hub is currently a collection of great but diverse information which needs focus. This should come as the community expands. People will find useful articles in the hub from one smaller sub and cross-pollinate into other appropriate subs. I estimate effects will be seen once the sub hits &gt;500 subscribers. At about this subscriber level there should also be a better ranking of the articles.

Secondly the sidebar provides a shortcut to quickly find small interesting  communities. This is what originally drew me in to this project - I wanted to clear my sidebar and provide an easy to reference list of the various business subs.

Thirdly if you are subscribed to this sub and /r/business etc. an article appearing in both subs has greater weight on your front page. Subscribing is a round about way of giving a greater weight to longer articles in the subs to which you currently subscribe.

Also and this is a personal point; At certain times I want to just read some interesting  business articles, not necessarily in my line of work, and I don't want to have to go looking to find them amidst blogs or wade through politics or slanted reads.
"
2013-07-10 13:20:55,"Not sure how many bites you're going to get out of this sub idea.  With the exception of news related postings, the articles and analysis in this sub are pretty solid.  

Also, I agree with /u/logic_card that you have no focus to your sub.  General business is not really a focus on which you can post in depth articles that will save people time.  If you take this sub as an example, it is focused pretty strongly on security analysis from a value investing standpoint.  As a result, there are not a large amount of posts a day (easy to keep up with).  Furthermore, because of the specific focus of the sub, there is more in depth analysis.  

Please dont take my criticism personally.  I do see value in creating a sub that is essentially a more serious version of /r/business.  I guess I am just saying that it may be hard to really get in depth analysis in a sub that is so broad.  My thoughts, in short, are that the more focused the sub...the more focused (and in depth) the posting.

2013-07-10 01:19:11,"Honestly, too many people do not grasp the fundamentals to these things as well as they should. In addition, too many people try to make these things more complicated than they need to be. You build a complex beast of a model when you are well past the initial talks and want something robust. If you build a beast of a model too soon, then you've probably built in too many assumptions and don't have enough information to price them exactly (plus they ""correct"" assumptions will be slightly wrong anyway), so it's useless. 

If I were you, I would find a simple but sufficiently detailed LBO template and learn how to make it  yourself. Just do it over and over again until you can make it from scratch in 30 minutes. Maybe I'm wrong and you can already do this, but I'm usually surprised by how many people can't, particularly when it comes to junior bankers and junior PE associates. 

Generally, once you can do this inside and out, and then you also understand a given company in question inside and out, then it's kind of just logical to build the rest of the model to company and context. Learning on the job for these multitude of iterations is probably going to better than trying to learn how to build a master LBO model for every single type of company in every single type of industry.

The price of gold over the past few years is a good example.

From 2009 to mid 2011 the general trend was around $300 a year. During this upward trend localized peaks were rarely lower than the last localized peak, when they were lower this signaled a temporary period of stagnancy. The trend was broken in August 2011 when gold had risen more than $300 in around a month, far more extreme than any previous rise, it then dropped from ~$1900 to $1600 and the next 2 peaks only reached ~1800. The ""mean"" price for August should have been around $1500, apparently 64% of Ron Paul's assets were in gold, had he followed this principle and sold when the price rose sharply and hit $1800 he would have saved himself from losing ~20% of his assets."

2014-01-21 15:10:49,"Wow I wish I had read this far down. Captspicy, that's exactly what I've been trying to say. It's price is such that if you're buying it, you're expecting your margin of safety to materialize in the form of the company's growth. I wasn't saying the company is bad, nor did I say it wouldn't grow. Management has advised lower numbers next year, but the year after could be record breaking. I'm not saying this won't happen. I'm just saying that it's not clear this WILL happen, for many of the reasons I listed above. It's going to recede next year, then what? Plateau in year 2, recover to current NI levels in year 3, and start compounding after that? Or break records right away in year 2? Or it could go the other way, and NI will fall in year 2 AND 3. This isn't something like coca cola or Colgate where next years sales and NI will predictably be 2-3% higher than this year's.

Because it's future earnings growth are not easily visible/predictable, and there are significant headwinds that it faces on a variety of fronts, I don't think it's a good idea to use expected future growth as a margin of safety in this case.

Because this is an investment analysis, I don't think it's a good investment. If it was a business analysis, I would most definitely agree that this is a great business. But as Capt said, the price isn't right. And you make your money when you buy ;)

* farm land/ water go together in california.  You can't value the farmland, value the water and add them together.  Farmland without water in california is worthless desert.

* water rights come in different forms in california.  Boswell has rights to water from the state, from the federal central valley project, and to underground water beneath their farmland, wellwater.  The amount of state and federal water they get is set at some maximum. Depending on how much rain fell that year, they get a percentage of the maximum.  (Right now they are saying 5%, because california is in a drought.)

* Agriculture water sells for substantially less than residential/urban water.  Depending on the source of the water (state, federal, or underground) you may or may not be able to convert agriculture water to urban water."

2014-01-18 12:24:42,"I have several.

The first two and maybe some of the third one I haven't done that much work on but I can give you a general overview.

Genworth Financial.(GNW) Insurance company that has gradually been on the rise back up to its tangible book value since the recession. Right now its market cap is $8 billion and it has $13.33 billion in tangible book value. So on a tangible book value basis you're getting $1 for 60 cents.  
GNW is also not losing money at all. It consistently has $800+ million in free cash flow a year. 

Next one is Symetra Financial. (SYA) Symetra is an insurance company and has a $2.32 billion dollar market cap with $3.01 billion tangible book value. Not that big of a deal on the tangible book value side ($1 for 77 cents) but SYA consistently has 900+ million dollars in cash from operating activities. 

One I know a little more about is MBIA. (MBI) MBIA stands for Municipal Bond Insurance Association. So, they obviously insure municipal bonds. MBIA got screwed over in the recession and everyone has hated it since. On a generally accepted accounting principals basis MBIA has $3.18 billion dollars in tangible book value and a $2.21 billion dollar market cap. So according to GAAP you're getting a $1 for 70 cents. Okay deal right? It gets better. MBIA insures municipal bonds. Historically speaking, the default rate for municipal bonds is so incredibly low. You can see here how low. http://i.imgur.com/Tf6exwq.png They currently have $2.5 billion in unearned premium revenue. This is money that they will receive if the bonds don't default. This is carried as a liability because they have to step in and pay bondholders if the city can't make its payments. And considering how low the default rate is we could VERY conservatively say that MBIA is set to have about $2.1billion dollars subtracted from their liabilities and put in their assets. So add $4.2 billion dollars to their tangible book value (Liabilities - 2.1B, Assets + 2.1B) and we get a tangible book value of $7.38 billion dollars. 2.2 billion dollars / 2.38 billion dollars is a dollar for a conservative 30 cents. It gets a bit better. MBIA settled a lawsuit on.. December 24th I think with ResCap and MBIA received 800 million dollars and their stock price literally did not move at all. (The previously mentioned $3.18 Billion in tangible book value is before that 800 million dollars added). If a bunch of cities decided that they didn't need insurance and MBIA wrote literally no new policies they would still receive that conservative $2.1. That's why I sort of don't care what their business is doing now because I am still receiving a ton of cash in the next couple years no matter what.

The last one is Sears. Yes I said it. Sears. I'm not going to explain the whole thing here but I wrote about it previously on /r/securityanalysis and here is the link if you haven't read it. http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1tfvlm/i_did_a_little_write_up_on_shld/

2014-01-18 09:41:46,"Mandalay Resources (MND): Bought in around 5 P/E, posting record sales and NI (before OCI) despite gold being incredibly low. Pretty strong management who wants to grow organically. Guaranteed money in my opinion, and not in the very long term either.

Zuoan Fashion (ZA): Bought in at a hair under 1 P/E. This company is overall insanely undervalued as its books show $7 cash per share for a $1.80 price, no debt, strong growth potential, great ROE etc. Just amazing everything. Of course there's a catch: It's a Chinese company. The company scores a few ""legit"" points (do your research) but it's been very reticent to declaring a dividend despite holding massive levels of cash, which raises a red flag. It promised one in the next quarter (would rather see small regular dividends imo), but we'll see. All in all, for a coin flip at 100% loss or 1500%+ gain over 5 years, it's worth at least a small position.

2014-01-17 22:30:47,"I would argue that a huge part of security analysis (and investing in general) is grappling with the unknowable future.  Decisions under uncertainty open humans up to all sorts of cognitive biases that can cause us to make mistakes.  Value investing in particular recognizes the effect of emotions and behavioral biases on security prices and IMO is the greatest legal opportunity for enterprising investors to ""beat the market"" either through higher returns or through lower risk for the same return.

For me, it reinforced what matters when I am trying to understand what creates value, what destroys value, and what doesn't matter.  Penman preaches anchoring valuation on the reported financial statements, which also helps fight the tendency to justify lofty valuations with high growth rates. Only growth that earns returns above the firm's cost of capital is what matters.

This could be exacerbated by fragmentation of international farming, meaning inadequate sources of capital for big ticket items like tractors. I don't know much about this but it's another consideration...if you don't have a lot of capital, but want more yield, you'll buy the least capital intensive option--seeds

Potentially exacerbated by the forthcoming tightening of credit in eEM as US rates rise

Further exacerbated if financial ops doesn't operate outside the US..again, something to look into"

2014-01-15 12:10:32,"1) 49% vs 45% is not a magic number, just a trend with bad implications.

2) the more that DE exposes themself to credit risk, the bigger the impact of a nightmare scenario on the balance sheet. And, again, I have trouble imagining how you boost lending that much without sacrificing quality. The nightmare scenario has a bigger impact, and is more likely to occur. Whatever that means, if anything, it's not good.


3) I think your last paragraph about interest rates rising necessarily implying crop price appreciation is total hogwash. Too many confounding variables.

Side note: everyone makes this point about how we need to more efficiently utilize farmland, especially internationally. But nobody ever says when this will happen.

2014-01-15 11:30:11,"Yes next year should see revenue decreasing between 2-5%

I don't think the next years should be as strong as the last 2-3. 
"
2014-01-15 10:01:27,"Here is my answer to your points 

1. Like any equipement manufacturers they finance their products. CAT does it for all their machines it's just the way it goes. The loans have very low risk of defaulting because the balance sheets of the farms are great. I speak here mostly if the US since this is where DE makes most of their money. Check a comment I posted in here where I  linked a presentation from DE on the balance sheet of the farms( stats from the USDA) and you'll see that default isn't the concern you expect it to be. 

1. It is not a secret that Deere trucks are more expensive than the others specificaly the domestic brands in emerging markets. They might not have pricing power for the moment but their products are still much stronger than the competition. Once the farmers of the emerging markets start making more money and that the land becomes a problem they like Europe and the US will need more yield per acre than they are getting right now. Paying more for DE gear will make sense then.  MEanwhile Europe will come back in the next years so that will help.

1. The financial arm was making money pre 2008 they will be an adjustment period but Deere financial isn't a REIT so they aren't that leveraged 

1. This one is a bit more problematic but I don't think they are invested 100% in stocks. Now they have to own fixed income but right now I would much prefer them being underweighted in fixed income and overweight in equity. RAtes are so low they will only kill principal of fixed income in the coming years. STocks have more freedom to go up since they can price in rising interest rates. The best course of action would be private equity but pension funds are limited in the exposure they can take. 

The discount rate is shit you are right and companies are a bit scumbags for using such low and irrealistic rates. They pretty much all do it and follow the market in there by restating down the line. It's sketchy at best but I think DE can pay it. 

Maybe we'll see a switch from Defined benefit down to Defined contribution for new employees in the coming years. I know IBM redid their pension plan recently. 


All in all great points to bring up 


"
2014-01-15 08:58:14,"I take it you think Section 179 was significant? I guess will find out for sure in 3 months. I'm a bit skeptical because it didn't seem to drive capital spending in the un-recovered segments of the economy - but that's not inconsistent with pre-buying by those who had the money to do so. Do you have any numbers on how much pre-buying might have gone on?

I wonder if you had a similar reaction to me ... reading about this company and their products, I'm sort of falling in love with them. They make really cool stuff! At the very least, their website and marketing materials strike me as far better than Cat or Case.

2014-01-15 04:05:10,[deleted]
2014-01-14 19:26:23,"Yes, and it's a legitimate business model in many cases. Notice how I didn't say that they generated 2 billion in finance receivables...I said they generated 2 billion more than last year. Which is precisely the difference between 2012 and 2013 revenue. In Essence, they're borrowing from themselves to generate sales growth. That type of growth isn't sustainable, and I also wonder if it's feasible to maintain credit standards in the process (it might be, and they might have, and so this might not be as big of a problem). I think the reason they're doing this is to incentivize more buying activity in off peak season, which is working if you look at Q1-Q4 numbers y-o-y. They intimated this somewhere in the 10k. How long can they continue growing by borrowing from themselves, and does their risk profile change? If farmland is in a bubble, the increasing financing receivables could spell terrible fucking news, even if they have been maintaining credit standards. What happens when interest rates rise and farmland prices fall? 1) sales generated from own financing disappear, hurting equip ops and financial ops, a double whammy, and 2) increased level of receivable inventory means they have more skin in the game and more to lose when farmers start defaulting

 

Loans they made last year that are bad wouldn't show up as NPLs yet, me thinks. "
2014-01-14 19:13:12,"Gunna read into this, thanks a lot. Wasn't sure about a lot of the pension stuff, but from my preliminary learning it seemed quite aggressive. Will respond in time"
2014-01-14 17:15:07,"1) DE's asset allocation isn't unusual for pension plans. Personally, I'd be significantly more concerned about a plan that was overwhelmingly in bonds.

2) Funding obligations are based on discount rate, not expected return on plan assets. EROPA is used solely to calculate income, with the net actual return on plan assets going to comprehensive income, which then gets ... amortized into income over time, I think? I'm actually not clear on that part. I believe it's explained in FASB 87.

3) If you buy Deere, it's because of the $3B+/year they'll hopefully be earning selling tractors to farmers for many years to come. They also have $11B in investable assets, against an estimated liability of $16B ... clearly that's not the same thing as buying an ETF, the math doesn't come close. Nevertheless, the pension plan exists. You can get mad at it if you want to, but if you want to have a rational opinion on DE the stock, you need to assign some cost to the pension plan, with reasonable bounds for upside and downside risk, and continue from there.

4) Yes, I'm long in stocks right now. I think we were spoiled by the situation 3 years ago, when many if not most companies were clearly cheap on a quantitative basis, using conservative assumptions. But I think it's a perfectly fine time for finding great companies at reasonable prices. I think Deere might be one of them, but I'm not sure yet.

&gt; Also, how in the HELL do you assume 8.5% return with only a 4% discount rate? Explain that one to me

Well it's 7.8%, but either way, they aren't related to each other. Pension accounting requires you to use a discount rate based on ... well I'll let the FASB speak for themselves:

&gt;The objective of selecting assumed discount rates is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due.

But they aren't invested exclusively in high-quality debt instruments, so they will do better. I don't think 7.8% is unreasonable. I think many, many stocks will return that much at current prices."
2014-01-14 16:15:10,"Since lower funding obligations and pension costs mean higher earnings, and these costs depend on their stock holdings performance, their profit level is a function of their stock
Holdings performance, or of market return. If I want my investment to be a function of market return, I'll buy an ETF. By itself, it may not have a giant impact on earnings. But, in tandem with lower NIM at financial ops, lower ROIC in growth markets bc they have no moat in these markets, and sales growth increasingly financed by their own finance arm (which is unsustainable and exposes them to more credit risk, esp if they loosened lending standards), I don't know that DE is a clear buy.

Not sure if I read the part about financing receivables correctly, but I think they sold 2 billion more worth of financing receivables (related to equipment ops) to themself in 2013....you should look into this and let me know what you think"
2014-01-14 16:06:35,"Bonds, like normal pension plans. Right now, their pension costs are dependent on the performance of a risky asset class. They are in stocks bc it lowers their funding obligations, but they are taking risk to generate that reward. Considering the nature of pensions, ie; someone's life When they retire, I'd say they're taking outsized risk for the return they're getting (not because the nature of the risk is outsized, but bc the nature of the effect of the risk is outsized...ie people not getting the pension that they were counting on when they retire). 

Essentially, costs are lower because they're investing in the stock market. But, at that point, they're betting on the performance of stocks....The reason I would buy Deere isn't because they're great stock pickers, or bc of the expected return of the market. But that's essentially what you're buying when you buy a company with a pension plan like this. You're betting on 1)the market and 2) the savvy of DEs pension fund managers. I have nothing to say about #2, but for #1, go long on an ETF...in principle it's the same damn thing. As a value investor, would you be long right now? Lots of the best value managers are moving into cash--they don't think they can make good investments in today's markets. Do you think this pension can perform better? 

Even 50% allocation is way too much for a pension plan. They could be in for a sticky situation when markets turn south, which could have the double effect of forcing them to revise LT assumptions that go into the PBO calc

And this is a defined benefit plan--if their stock investments don't pay off, they're on the hook 100%.

Also, how in the HELL do you assume 8.5% return with only a 4% discount rate? Explain that one to me"

2014-01-13 05:57:30,"The main thing is that this is a ""daily"" ETF, meaning that it seeks to match the activity (but in the inverse) of the 20 yr bond. In other words, the managers of the etf basically go home flat each night, and put the short back on in the morning.  So this is a more useful tool if you think that the 20 yr will go down in the very near term, because the math that goes along with it is more akin to compounding daily vs monthly. For examply, if the benchmark (20 yr bond here) were to go down say 3% over a month, the etf would likely not be up 3% due to compounding (not to mention transaction costs).

If you're more of a long term bear, you could short the bond outright. However, if you short the bond outright you will be responsible for paying any and all coupons for as long as you are short."

The answer is no, because even if it breaks even, keeping $1000 today is worth more than having the full $1000 returned 10 years from now.

DCF helps measure how much those individual yearly payments would need to be to break even:  How much the payment stream is worth as an equivalent today.  Since you could put that $1000 in a risk free investment (say GIC or government bonds) for 10 years, you can use that interest rate to discount the future payment streams.  ie.  $100 next year is worth $98 today @ 2% interest rate."

2014-01-11 16:57:22,"The comment posted are talking more about present value mechanics and less so about the objective of discounted cash flow analysis.

A DCF requires 2 things:

1. An accurate forecast of cash flows from an asset (say, for example, the rent collected on an apartment building investment)

2. An accurate estimate of the opportunity cost of capital (sticking with the same example as 1. the rent collected off other apartment buildings adjusting for all the risks of owning a different apartment building than you invested in I.e. Tenant defaults) 

The objective of the DCF is to analyze the relative opportunity of your investment to all other potential investments you could make.  The value gained is therefore realized when you have accurately analyzed these two requirements such that you can allocate your money towards the best possible return while taking into account the risks.

This analysis is particularly helpful with stocks since the frictional costs of buying one stock over another are practically zero. To compare one stock investment to another, DCFs are therefore helpful.  

P/E multiples (and all other multiples) are simply quick ways of doing DCFs. However, the exercise of completing a cash flow forecast and cost of capital analysis allows you to test the assumptions being made by investors and critically analyzing them by doing your own research.

2014-01-11 12:06:10,"With the caveats that I'm self-taught at this stuff, and pension accounting is complex, here's my take on it. Looking forward to others' insights.

The first hint at overall magnitude is on the balance sheet liabilities (pg. 36), line item ""Retirement benefits and other liabilities."" At 10/31/2013, this was $5.4 billion. That means that they'd have to add $5.4 billion to their underfunded retirement plans just to get to the point where plan assets equal the present-value of projected benefit obligations (assuming not very much is ""other""). You can net out the $0.5B of ""Retirement Benefits"" listed under assets, implying that some plans are overfunded. You'll also see in the Statement of Consolidated Income (pg. 35) the line item ""Retirement Benefits Adjustment,"" which was $1.95B in FY2013.

With a market cap of $33B and Net Income of $3.5B, these aren't small numbers. So let's look at some details.

Move to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7: ""Pension and other post-retirement benefits"" running pp. 42-47. A good starting point is the table found at the bottom of page 43, with the headline ""The benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:"" Here you can see projected obligation, broken out between pension and health/life insurance, as well as plan assets with a similar split. So we see the overall magnitude of the plans: $12.2B in plan assets, and $16.9B in projected obligations. Note that at year end, *all* of the deficit was on the health/life insurance side of the ledger. 

Services costs were $330m - i.e., that's how much additional obligation they incurred from an extra year of employers working and incurring benefits. I note that it's disproportionately weighted toward pension plans ... this might mean that they are scaling back post-retirement health plans, and their obligations are primarily residual? I'd consider that good news if true, but haven't found info to confirm.

Actuarial gain in 2013 of $2B (!) - that's simply because assumptions about the future changed from 2012. So that gives you a sense of how far off these predictions might be from reality. The change in 2013 appears to have been primarily driven by health care cost assumptions, with the damning(?) line: ""An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $717 million."" Current assumptions are 6.5% short-term annual cost increase, slowly declining to 5% per-year annual cost increases. In other words, a guess.

To make the bull case, with a not-unreasonable expected return on plan assets of 7.8%, well in excess of the discount rate of 4.5%, they can and should make up some ground (this gets recorded in the income statement, as expected return on plan assets net of interest cost, which came to $168m in 2013). The optimist in me wants to believe that healthcare costs will not increase at the rate they predict. But it would be foolish to pretend it can't happen.

How should we take these numbers to update earnings, return on equity, etc.? That's not a rhetorical question. I'm really not sure what the takeaway is, besides that while the numbers don't terrify me - these plans, with $1B/year in benefit payouts for the foreseeable future, won't bankrupt Deere anytime soon - it certainly would be better for shareholders if the plans didn't exist in the first place.

"
2014-01-11 10:46:36,"At first pass at the article, I wonder if that book value of equity is a realistic number. For an eroding company the book value can stay inflated if the company never takes a write down. 

Einhorn did a good job pointing issues in the book value of real estate at St. Joe, and that company didn't outperform the market. 

Also if theres goodwill, then basically all this company has to do to pass a goodwill impairment test is to be a living and breathing company. So with no write downs of goodwill, means inflated book equity. 

While its good that the CEO own +70% of the stock, but does that mean that that CEO is afraid to look bad and manipulate the books to avoid wealth decline? Or is he on the same side of investors?"

2014-01-11 04:41:22,"P*r = e

P = Price
r = rate of return (%)
e = earnings

Basically, what we have here is a basic obvious formula. If you bought a machine for $100 last year, and you made $20 from it in one year, we can say that the rate of return is 20%. Similarly, if $400 and earned $80, r is the same.

In valuing whether to buy an item or not, we often use this formula. Let's say you want to buy a fridge. The fridge costs $300 (P1), but the amount you save from being able to buy in bulk one month in advance nets you $50 per week (e). So in 2 months, you would have saved $400 (P₂). Therefore, since P₂&gt;P1, the rate of return is satisfactory.

Now in valuing a stock, you want to do the same. However, predicting a company's future e's accurately requires some finesse. So one day an enterprising analyst reverse-engineered the formula and said, if we can get some kind of prediction on the r, we can switch the formula around based on the current e's, like this: 

P*r = e

P = e / r


Basically, calculating it's current price based on it's future r's and future e's. Like the fridge example above. 

It all seems well and good on paper, until you realize that future r's and e's are impossible to determine accurately. A company has so many moving parts, and therefore so many factors come into play. Macroeconomic, microeconomic, potentials, catastrophes... everything is being squeezed into one formula. Not to mention that each individual component which makes up 'e' can have its own set of rules and uncertainties. So when making guesses, analysts like to make a range of r's as a shortcut of accommodating all the possible e's. Which, as we've seen with the 2008 crisis or Japanese tsunami, does not act as a sufficient margin of error.

So does the DCF work? In my humble opinion, no. I have yet to find someone who can satisfactorily justify its use to me, and I am actually hoping someone can prove me wrong. What Warren did in his younger days, (and I believe even now) is to look at the company's current resources and see whether it can realistically achieve a satisfactory expected 'r'. If it can, he does it; if it can't, he doesn't; like the fridge. I always get stumped when I see the calculations which try to simulate his past investment decisions, because they never satisfactorily account for many factors. A sufficient margin of error is useful to mitigate the effects, but as we've seen with Geico, Warren doesn't really care about margin of error. It's just something we use because we don't have anything better, like CAPM for risk, I suppose.

No matter what the required capital ratios are, there will always be people trying to game them. I think that if capital requirements were thrown out, banks would focus their energy not on gaming capital ratios but on ensuring solvency. I have no evidence that says this would work, so of course this is completely speculative. The ""evidence"" you speak of only points to the fact that the pre-recession capital ratios were too low. This means either 1) capital ratios need to be much higher (as you said, and I think almost everyone agrees), or 2) that capital ratios are inherently useless. "

Something along the lines of ""if you take away speed limits, people tend to drive slower"" - it makes part of me think that if we took away capital ratio requirements then banks would naturally become more conservative/overcapitalized.

2012-06-25 12:56:42,"&gt;You can only know how accurate your inputs are ex-post, so I'd want a simpler system to implement to determine position size.
  
Good point, I've needlessly complicated the process.
  
&gt;Although these are just rough estimates, they can be a guide for me to use when determining position size. As I get more data about my record, I can adjust these winning probabilities as needed.
  
I'm starting to agree that this is the best way to incorporate Kelly, by using rough estimates and using the Kelly number as a yardstick when determining position size. Then over time the accuracy of this yardstick measurement will (hopefully) improve. "
2012-06-25 12:50:21,"&gt;You can assign probabilities to the accuracy of your inputs and reduce Kelly to lower percentage to account for possible mis-estimates.

&gt;Let's say you're about 75% confident that the $15 bull case price target is correct. But there is a 25% chance that it will fall between $11-$14:

&gt;(.75 * $15)+(.25 * Average($11:$14))
would yield an adjusted bull case price target of: $14.375

&gt;which would adjust your Kelly number down to:

&gt;Edge = (50% * ($14.375-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.1875 Odds = $4.375 f = 27%

&gt;You could then adjust all your inputs for the probability of them being accurate.

This model has too many moving parts for me.  It's hard enough to assess ""winning"" probabilities in the bull/bear cases. I would now have to assign another probability to how confident I am in my valuation.  On top of this, you attach a valuation range to your probability where I might not have pulled the trigger to invest.  Additionally, I would sandbag one of the inputs to the valuation (multiples, growth rate, market share, margins, WACC, recovery rates, normalized earnings power, etc) to adjust how confident I am, rather than attaching another probability at the end of the calculation.  The process has a false precision where the extra inputs could be an additional a source of error.  You can only know how accurate your inputs are ex-post, so I'd want a simpler system to implement to determine position size.

I know my record.  I'm an average stock picker.  Most of my investments go nowhere, and fortunately my big winners outpace my big losers. Using my record alone, the only way I get a higher winning percentage is if the investment situation is different from the norm.  I think of my winning probabilities like this:

Special Situations (Bankruptcy Reorg, Spinoffs, Tender Offers, Liquidations, Risk Arb) - 65-95% 

Equity With Other Catalyst (Increased Distribution, Earnings Beat, Temporary Crisis, Legal Judgement in Company's Favor, etc) - 50-65% 

Equity With No Catalyst - 50%

I'm anchoring on the relative certainty or merger arb situations to handicap the probabilities in other equity investment situations.  Although these are just rough estimates, they can be a guide for me to use when determining position size.  As I get more data about my record, I can adjust these winning probabilities as needed.

For bull case valuation I would stick to what I already do.  I'd want to find investments where I can purchase equity for at least a 1/3 discount to my assessment of intrinsic value.

Bear case valuation method would depend on the type of company I'm investing in.  My valuation would be based a normal worst case scenario for the company.  If the company is a net-net I would choose liquidation value as a bear case.  If it is a cyclical company, my bear case valuation would revolve around earnings power at a discount to normalized margins/multiples.  If its a faster growing company, my bear case valuation would revolve around slower growth rates and smaller margins.

This is new for me as well.  Let's see how I can incorporate this into my current mock portfolio. "

2012-06-25 12:23:20,"Hell of a presentation, thanks for posting"
2012-06-25 08:55:30,"Wow, excellent post. I agree spot on with your evaluation of using Kelly for M&amp;A deals, where both the bull price and bear price are reasonably obvious, and the probability of ""winning"" is more certain.
  
For normal equity investments, the two inputs of:  
1. the bull/bear prices  
2. the probability of ""winning""  
are much less certain to estimate. 
I'm not comfortable using a 50/50 split as a probability of ""winning"". How do you or I know that is an accurate percentage?  
  
Additionally the bull/bear case prices are not easy to identify. Two analysts can come to different intrinsic values for a certain stock. And that being said, the market may price the stock completely differently (both in a bull and a bear case). 
  
I agree with your final insights: Kelly inspires much more confidence in its results when (a) the risk/return or probability of winning is high, AND when you can achieve a high level of accuracy when measuring the inputs. In these cases I would be comfortable using a Kelly value that is closer to the true Kelly value. (i.e. 3/4ths Kelly, etc.)
  
Additionally I would say that the use of Kelly in less-certain circumstances still has value! For example take your calculation:
  

Edge = (50% * ($15-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.5  
Odds = $5  
f = 30%  
  
You can assign probabilities to the accuracy of your inputs and reduce Kelly to lower percentage to account for possible mis-estimates.
  
Let's say you're about 75% confident that the $15 bull case price target is correct. But there is a 25% chance that it will fall between $11-$14:
  
(.75 * $15)+(.25 * Average($11:$14))  
would yield an adjusted bull case price target of: $14.375

which would adjust your Kelly number down to:
  
Edge = (50% * ($14.375-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.1875
Odds = $4.375
f = 27%
  
You could then adjust all your inputs for the probability of them being accurate. "
2012-06-24 23:47:35,"I thought alot about this in the past couple of days because I also didn't know how to start quantifying the probability of ""winning"".  I thought of something that will help us both.

I dabble in merger arbitrage with smaller companies as the spreads are usually large enough to warrant investigation.  I usually only look at friendly, cash, acquisitions for investment.  I estimate the probability of these deals closing at 90+% (95+% after the acquirer secures financing).  You can find research papers that elaborate on price implied M&amp;A closing odds, [M&amp;A closing odds based on characteristics of transactions](http://people.hbs.edu/mbaker/cv/papers/arbitrage.pdf), as well as the actual records of successful M&amp;A transaction closings in different time periods.  Those estimates will come in around the figures cited.  In situations like this, it is easy see how large of a position the Kelly Criterion recommends.

For example, [On May 14th, 2012, TII Network Technologies (NSDQ:TIII) agreed to be acquired by Kelta, Inc for $2.15/share](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/TIII.O/key-developments/article/2540236).  Before the announcement, TIII was trading at $1.45.  This deal is not predicated on Kelta finding financing as they have enough cash and credit to consummate the transaction currently.  In the days after the announcement, you could have easily bought shares for $2.06 and they expect the deal to close in the 3rd quarter of 2012.  With this investment, you have a prospective 14% unlevered annualized return opportunity and enough information to plug into the Kelly Formula.

Kelly Formula: f(Position Size) = Edge/Odds

Since this is a friendly, cash only, takeover not subject to financing, I'll peg the probability of this transaction closing at 95%.  Let's assume that if the deal doesn't close, TIII will trade at its price before the acquisition announcement, $1.45/share.  Therefore:

Edge = (95% * ($2.15-$2.06)) + (5% * ($1.45-2.06)) = $.055

Odds = $.09

f = 61.1%

It's easy to see why many use half/modified Kelly positions as a 61% position in any security would make me uncomfortable.

Now, you will not find equity investments where you have a 90% probability of winning outside of merger arbitrage and other special situations.  [CXO Advisory follows ""guru"" bullish/bearish statements](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/#notes).  The rockstar gurus are right 66% of the time.  The average guru is right 48% of the time.  Although their ""study"" is colloquial and more macro than micro in nature, it mirrors the pronouncement I've heard; ""You are absolutely killing it if your stock picks are right 60% of the time.""  Since I'm definitely not a rockstar guru, and my long term track record doesn't show abnormal stock picking skill, I will always say my probability of ""winning"" is 50/50 in normal equity investments.

After all the previous setup info, let's go back to your example you posed (Stock XYZ trades at $10/share and you value it at $15/share).  You still need to calculate a bear case return to effectively use the Kelly Formula.  Let's say in the worst case scenario, the company liquidates and brings in $8/share to equity holders.

Edge = (50% * ($15-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.5

Odds = $5

f = 30%

Lastly, the insight I get from the Kelly Criterion is that investors should focus on situations where the return/risk is very high, or the probability of winning is very high.  Sometimes I hear analysts cite return/risk ratios when pitching investments.  It is now obvious to me why they do this.

Both of us should now be able to put the Kelly formula to good use."

2012-06-22 19:43:28,"The upward price mobility depends on if you think that the people that are shorting the stock are right or wrong.  If they're right, the stock will keep going down.  If they're wrong, the stock should rip upwards in a short squeeze at some point in the future.

[Nasdaq has a website where you can view the short interest in a stock](http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx).  This information is updated every 2 weeks with a 2 week delay, i think.  You can use this to back into how much institutional ownership a stock has.

Using SVU as an example, [it has 103.3M shares sold short](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/svu/short-interest).  That's 48.6% of shares sold short.  Using the 111% figure cited above, SVU actually has 62.4% institutional ownership."
2012-06-22 18:20:59,"wow i never even thought of that. makes complete sense.  now in terms of reading into that, would it be safe to say that those over 100% have more question marks in terms of upward price mobility than most ""winner"" stocks that hover around 70% ownership (ie. GOOG/AAPL/etc.)? or is it that, regardless of percentage, some of the ownership could be long and some short- ie. even a stock that has 11% ownership could all be on the short side? and is there a website that breaks down the ownership details in this regard?"
2012-06-22 18:14:18,"It means the security has high institutional ownership and it is also being shorted.

When you think of the mechanics of shorting, a individual (or institution) borrows shares from another investor (or institution) and sells those shares back into the market.  As a result, more than one person can ""own"" the same shares due to shorting.  

[For instance, SVU is at 111%](http://www.google.com/finance?q=SVU)."

Owner earnings formula doesn't actually say that you have a terrible year in years that you make large capital investments because it doesn't actually use cashflow, but net income excluding depreciation.  So you never subtract from performance capital expenditures.  So you have no impact on ""performance"" in spending years, and a nice impact on subsequent years.

The reason net income (including depreciation) is fine, is that you are likely to need to replace the depreciated asset near the end of its depreciated life, so it is a decent estimate of future cash outflows."

Ackman explains that they've been in business so long by expanding into new markets and experiencing ""pops and drops"" as he called it...basically a boom for 2 years, followed by a rapid deterioration in sales as the retail structure unraveled due to the Non Sales Leaders dropping out as they made no profits.

Now, HLF is running out of countries to ""pop""...they're expanding in African countries like Ghana which have really no need (or market) for overpriced weight loss products. They are just going there to expand their pyramid.

There is a lot more evidence in the presentation to back the claim that HLF is indeed a pyramid scheme.

No.  Going in he was likely an average student.  The article would have mentioned if he had gotten a full ride.

I already stated he was hardworking with above average ambition.

&gt;Of course he had a good head start, you think Buffett or Klarman or Soros didn't. 

Soros was raised a Jew in worn-torn Hungary.  His family split themselves up to avoid getting sent to concentration camps by the Nazis.  He arrived in London broke and begged his way into finance.

Buffett had read *every* book in his local library by the age of 10.  He started his own business at 13.  He ran a shitload of businesses as a kid and had $1.6 million (inflation adjusted) in personal capital by the time he was 26.  He read and memorized Value-Line for fun.  You're right though in that he also had rich friends to help him fund his first fund.
&gt;
&gt;Cut the kid some slack and feel free to judge him in 10 years time when he has a longer track record.

I don't because the article makes him out to be some investing genius when its really not warranted.  Its just like all those bullshit piano prodigy news stories that you hear about every few years.  How many times have you heard on the news about some 5 year old kid touted to be the next Mozart or Beethoven, only to be never heard of again.  The selling point of the article is his young age, and how it portends he's gonna be the next Buffett when he grows but past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, especially in finance."

So because the article doesn't mention that he received any scholarship the most logical and rational conclusion must be that he wasn't an outstanding student? And I don't think you get a bachelor's and masters from Cornell along with being on the cycling and rowing teams, starting a company that has been used by Cornell and The World Bank and your own fund all at the age of 25 by being a slacker.

yes it's sales numbers are inflated.

not 27.

$50k was the extent of the fund's assets.

The assets don't need to be in your fund. You just have to convince other shareholders to stand with you, which is what he apparently did. Anyone can do it: just pick up the phone. It's not that surprising; what is surprising is that this doesn't happen more often in the fraudulent microcap world.

Others sure do, and I see nothing wrong with it. It is not as if we are uninformed consumers. If they slander, lie, and do not back up their facts, then they are doing something wrong and manipulating. 

I don't see how exposing a fraud and opening the market's eyes is manipulation. Should frauds and poor businesses go unpunished and with good names until regulators wake-up or they implode? 

In this case, Michael Johnson had nothing but ad hominem attacks and even stated the world would be better without Ackman. Like so many executives he is responding with aggression and posturing rather than substance. "
2012-12-21 16:40:19,"Not that impressive when you read into it.  

Anyone can do the work to be an activist investor; no one gives a shit unless you have tons of money/stock though.  The article mentions that they started their fund with an inheritance and some money from the company he founded.  Even with a partner, they only had $50,000 combined startup-capital.  That means the overwhelming majority of the fund's assets come from the friends he solicited.  Rich friends.  

You don't go bossing around $50,000,000 companies with $50,000 in seed money.  He also happened to start his fund right at the bottom of the worst financial crisis since the great depression (to his credit he acknowledges this).  The whole value approach thing is kind of bullshit because all his successes on the chart are only looking at a 1-2 year timeline, way too short for any real value approach.

This guy may be above average in ambition, but the bulk of his success comes from his background, not his genius investing ability.  Someone who was born on third base and took advantage of it to get to home."
2012-12-21 15:56:17,"It's different, take a closer look. Warren Buffett doesn't care about the price in the least. He cares about the underlying value. On the other hand a short strategy only works if the price catches up with the value. How on Earth can we make sure that HLF declines in the interval of a few months (instead of 1, 3 or 10 years)? By exposing their deals. He has had to open the market's eyes in order to realize a profit."

2012-12-21 13:51:36,"Even if you confine it to the cases of Einhorn and Ackman, unveiling a fraud to the SEC and other regulatory agencies can accomplish little to nothing. Both of them have had extensive experiences where regulators did absolutely nothing and largely ignored them despite evidence. 

As to market manipulation, I have to strongly disagree. If Warren Buffet or some other reputable manager goes on tv and discloses a long position they have built up, we will see a material change in the stock price. Nobody cares about that because its framed in a positive light. There is still a strong stigma (ridiculous in my opinion) against short sellers. With the abysmal record of regulatory agencies, short sellers are essential to uncovering frauds that are far more common than retail investors would believe. Failure of these regulators is why I am abstaining from this short. I hope I'm wrong because that would mean the SEC is wising up."
2012-12-21 13:33:31,"Given that the company has been around for long, I suspect the catalyst is Ackman 's public accusation itself, which should instigate an investigation and cut the flow of new suckers.
If it wasn't for Ackman uncovering the scheme, his short position would have been pointless since nobody can predict when the business was going to collapse. Regardless of whether Herbalife is running a scam and whether Ackman is acting in the benefit of the public, we can also make the case that he is manipulating the market for his own success, no?"
2012-12-21 12:26:46,"While I agree that Ackman is arrogant and does grandstand, I think this is a pretty strong thesis. Just because they are famous does not mean a hedge fund manager is infallible.

I agree it's a pyramid scheme but I don't have any idea of the timeline before it collapses."
2012-12-21 11:24:29,"I believe that most of these ""legitimate"" pyramid schemes that exist today (and some are huge) can be adequately grouped together as ""product-based pyramids"". In order to remain under the radar of the FTC, they cannot pay their reps directly for ""recruiting"". In other words, the company cannot just hand over cash for signing up new members, because this would effectually resemble a Ponzi scheme. While some may say that no purchase is required, all new members are subject to a hard sell by their upline ""success"" handlers to do so. You have to follow orders in order to be successful, they are told.

I personally believe that the use of the product to facilitate this transfer of money from the bottom base of recruits, up to the higher tiers of the pyramid, is why they have longevity over a classic pyramid/ponzi that just takes money and gives it directly to someone else. In all cases, it is proven that they peddle higher-priced products that may or may not even make it on their own in the traditional marketplace. There just seems to be a fairly large supply of people who are easily deluded into thinking that buying this crap will make them rich.  So the collapse of the structure only happens after saturation of the market with the knowledge that the money only quits flowing when potential recruits are aware of the fact that they are actually the target consumer."

Generally though, I personally believe the people acting solely on information ""Ackman shorts Herbalife"" are actually making the market more efficient, thus people like Ackman are good for the market. However, if Ackman reveals information and thought-process why he's shorting Herbalife (and it makes sense because the market agrees) then is that so bad? For example, Greenlight showed its presentation on Green Mountain and it all made sense, so the market reacted DESPITE the fact it could have before.  Greenlight just put the dots together.  Just some thoughts.  The line for market manipulation is somewhat fuzzy for these bigger guys though.  If they were CFA charterholders I'm sure they would have surrendered their charters by now. "

As the technology improves I don't really see any competitive advantages.  Content providers will be forced to offer a service that is at least as good as pirating, a one stop shop for content on any device.  

The only differentiation I see in the future is in the content libraries themselves.  Apple and Google don't own anything.  Netflix leases theirs.  All the actual valuable content is owned by these bloated bricks and mortar tv companies of yesteryear, how do you extract the value of the library from that?

Apple of course pulled it off in music, but they controlled the entire chain from iTunes -&gt; iPod.  They don't have an equivalent to the iPod in the tv space and I think iTunes was a massive wake up call to everyone remotely related to the market, they all understand how burned they got by giving Apple such a huge lead there.

2012-12-20 13:17:55,"If I were you, I'd wait.  Far too early to determine the major players in a new paradigm for TV.

A decent guess is Apple, but I personally detest Apple's long-term direction (an opinion not shared by many these days)."
2012-12-20 12:51:20,"....but that exit price would have only come about, based on the idea that when he announced hes doing this, it would go down, no?

how can we know if that exit price would have come about on its own, without him shorting it and then declaring he shorted it?
"
2012-12-20 12:09:29,"Yes that is what you call market manipulation. But because he's so prominent, he probably has good documentation that he will only exit at a certain price that he originally conceived before he announced this. If regulators were to check his documents, they could (would) see he has a thesis in place, and if/when it is realized, only then will he exit the short. "
2012-12-20 11:08:57,"is it legal, for someone to have this much influence?

couldn't he have shorted it, said he's doing it, let people sell/short, stock value drops, and he buys/closes his shorts?"
2012-12-19 22:08:38,The current TV model will slowly die as did the music and newspaper industries. This is clear. Who will benefit from this demise? How long will it take? I.e. what should I invest in now? NBC Universal?

2012-12-19 21:23:20,"Also, recovering data from a regular hard disk is much easier then from a SSD drive. And regular drives have much higher life cycles, then SSD;s."
2012-12-19 20:56:16,"Enterprises won't get anywhere near 4TB drives unless the failure (UBE) rate drops by several orders of magnitude and speeds improve so a RAID rebuild takes hours, not days at massively reduced performance. They're all using ~300GB SAS drives now, regular large capacity drives are already relegated to archival roles.

When enterprise-grade SSDs drop near current consumer-level SSD pricing (hell, even $2-$3 per GB), we'll all jump ship in a heartbeat. The massive IOPS (in some cases 30000% more than spinning discs) and failure mechanism (turning read-only) really make them ideal for enterprise use."
2012-12-19 20:26:22,"You're right HDDs can store a massive amount of data.  Unfortunately most companies care more about the IO operations/second and total storage capacity is secondary.  The enterprise market will not be the savior for HDDs - though they will be the last people still using them.  Consider that even now people are buying 300GB or less 15k rpm drives just for IOPs.  

HDDs are the equivalent of tape drives - lots of storage but very slow access time.  For example a 1TB WD Enterprise drive has a 128MB/sec write time.  It will take 2 hours to fill the entire drive assuming you are writing sequentially (A database or other real world application would take several orders of a magnitude longer)."
2012-12-19 20:10:42,"Yep, and SSDs are no where near the cost/capacity effecicency. 4Tb will become standard in 2013--- SSD's are no where close to that on an enterprise level with costs around 10x as much for similar units. 

You'll see 10-20Tb become standard, and most likely hybrid solutions (Smaller SSD on the same HDD unit) before SSD catches up."
2012-12-19 20:08:16,"&gt;It's still an end of life technology, even if that end won't be immediate.

Over what time period? The HDD market is still growing and SSDs are nowhere near the price or capacity efficency. 

There is still a lot of growth in the HDD market until at LEAST 2020:

- 2010: ~650M units of HDDs, 10M units of SSD
- 2015: ~850M units of HDDs, 50M units of SSD
- 2020: ~1TB units of HDDs, 200M units of SSD

But it really depends on which category you're talking about. One size does NOT fit all. By 2020 the cloud will account for &gt;60% of the total drive capacity shipped (enterprise and personal cloud).

Client compute will decrease obviously, but consumer electronics and smart phones will account for a smaller part of the total storage capacity than they do today, by about 1/2 - 2/3. 

So while single client compute will see a lot more SSDs, enterprise HDD utilization has at least another 10 years and will most likely see a hybrid configuration currently being implemented by Seagate (the largest enterprise HDD company). "
2012-12-19 19:12:31,"theres tons of years left for hard drives
all they need to do is keep up with the tech

put in larger SSD ""caches"" to speed up r/w of old fashioned wheel drives

these assholes got greedy after the flooding and kept/raised their prices of the drives, even when production was high
so they didn't get as many orders, and had surplus stock
"
2012-12-19 15:21:27,"It's still an end of life technology, even if that end won't be immediate. Hard drives of today will suffer the same fate as tape drives. Unless you are just archiving people want their storage to be fast and not just big. "

I'm not going to deny that Accounting can be a really dry and boring topic and the fun part would be the application of Accounting knowledge in understanding and valuing companies. But jumping into a 10-K would be more like trying to run before learning how to walk. 

There have been posts on r/investing, and r/finance where people ask for accounting help to value a company but they don't even know the basic accounting equation.

2012-12-16 19:25:43,"In addition, the article is more about financial statement analysis, not accounting.

2012-12-16 18:57:28,"After you've learned the fundamentals, sure. Otherwise just jumping into 10-Ks with the expectation of learning accounting will be a bit troublesome. I'd read a K just to get an idea of what may be in there, but to avoid googling every little thing, I'd argue it helps to have a basic understanding of GAAP to make your goolging a bit more educated.

There are too many variables with a small cap stock that are hard for one person without the resources of a hedge fund to get a grasp on.  If you are an experienced investor you might be okay.

I find that finding a good short isn't a problem. It's finding a short with reasonable borrow, and a short that is executable. The idea is almost always feasible, but execution is really what makes the difference.

There is a lot of execution risk, and people frequently forget that. If you're mindful of the execution risk you'll do fine. (I think, not a lot of experience doing shorting)"

There's on target -- no ands, ifs, or buts -- for, there will be 480m supply in the next handful of years, with maybe no increase in demand.  Asian prices (the benchmark) have fallen from $16-18 per million cubic feet to $7; these plants are uneconomic.”"

2015-08-21 10:00:52,"It doesn't completely resonate with me that this drop in oil price is truly a supply/demand thing. With oil I feel like price changes only affect demand marginally, it doesnt make sense that people are completely changing their consumption patterns based on the price of oil, I for one can tell you it has not affected my decision making much at all. To me, the price change has more to do with people's beliefs and less to do with actual supply/demand factors. If people believe oil is going up they buy driving up the price, if they believe its going down they sell and further drive it down. I see the price swings more of a perception problem. As an example I saw this with Jordan shoes, when I was younger jordans werent that cool, they were normal shoes and I could buy them for a reasonable price, perception has changed over the last 10 years and now they sell like crazy and prices have increased! its not a supply demand thing, its a perception change that has affected the economics of the situation."

2015-08-20 20:42:42,"You can probably try a number of screens, but flip open any Ben Graham book and I'm sure you'll see him cite net current asset value as compared to the market cap as an easy way to get started. If a company has $10 of current assets, and $4 in debt, then a simple liquidation value is $6. That $6 is worth it if you can get the firm for less than that, which is measured by the market cap. 

From there, you can do a deeper analysis of the situation. Read the 10-k, conference calls, etc.

You have to be cautious of the value trap situation however, because there's a chance that it's priced cheap for a reason - maybe there won't be a liquidation so that shareholders can realize value. 

In some cases, management will actually do what's necessary, but not always. Just be cautious going into them. Often times, you can get a *pop* in the share price on any kind of good news so investors can do okay in a trade, but if it's a real investment that you'll see through to cash realization, then the risks are more than I realized when I first got into it."

2015-08-20 11:05:31,"This article is quite well written but lacks much value unless you've had your eyes closed for the past 6 months. 

- Oil prices have been dropping so demand for upstream drilling and exploration has fallen
- Big companies don't want to invest more into this division unless it's profitable 
- The least profitable area is offshore because it is most expensive and is less justifiable at the current oil price
- There is now an over-supply of rigs due to the fact companies are reducing drilling operation. 

This is exactly what we'd expect when it comes to supply and demand. The supply was high so it covered the demand and competition for the demand pushed prices down. To compensate for the fall in price we are now seeing a fall in supply because it's not profitable to drill in all areas at every price. Hopefully this will satisfy OPEC members as international supply falls and they will reduce some of their production. 

The most interesting point of the article is the opinion that oil will not rebound and that this action reflects that. In my eyes the oil companies are being cautious. Yes you can snap up a bargain at the moment but the future seems uncertain because oil prices may not recover, this may be the new norm. Whether that's true or not it is diligent for big companies who already have an excess of drilling opportunities to not buy lots more upstream operations at auction. "

2015-08-19 22:06:09,"Here is an Einhorn presentation on Aercap, an aircraft leasing company.  Skip to 2nd half.  Similar model to banks and easy to understand math.  

https://www.greenlightcapital.com/926211.pdf

"
2015-08-19 21:17:33,"Here's a concrete example:  Imagine a company purchased $100 of assets (since we're talking about banks, picture loans).  These loans are expected to return 3%.  Imagine as well that these loans are similar to other other assets that you, the bank stockholder, could invest in by yourself (similar in terms of risk, however you want to define it).  The expected return on these similar assets that you could invest in personally is also 3%.  Now - if you only look at ROIC, you would say that this bank is not ""creating value"" for you the shareholder.  They are taking your money and investing at 3% when you yourself could be investing in very similar assets and also earning 3%.  No value add.  But wait - the bank probably financed the $100 asset purchase by raising $95 from deposits and only $5 from you.  Let's assume the interest rate the bank has to pay depositors is 0%.  The expected ROE for you as a bank shareholder is therefore 60%.  But if you tried to do the same things without the bank, it's highly unlikely you would be able put $5 down to purchase something worth $100 and pay 0% to the people you borrowed money from.  Let's say that if you did this on your own, you'd have to pay 2%.  The ROE you would get by yourself would only be 22% [ (100*10% - 95*2%) / 5 ].  So - Even though the bank is not ""creating value"" for you the shareholder ""on the left-hand side of the balance sheet"" (i.e. by investing the money wisely), they are ""creating value"" for you the shareholder ""on the right-hand side of the balance sheet"" (i.e. by raising capital at below market rates).  All of this ignores taxes and costs of financial distress (with no loss of generality)."
2015-08-19 20:43:07,"ROIC (NOPAT / Invested Capital) is a good metric for most businesses, but not for financial services companies (particularly banks).  Why?  Well, you first need to understand why ROIC is a good metric for most businesses.  Most businesses try to raise capital (debt and equity) at competitive prices and then use that capital to buy assets at below competitive prices.  Said differently, most businesses pay relatively competitive risk-adjusted rates when raising capital (debt and equity) and then turn around and try to invest that capital at risk-adjusted rates that are higher than their investors could get elsewhere.  All of the emphasis is on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, i.e. investing capital at higher than competitive rates.  ROIC measures the rate of return the business is earning is on what it invests; so it is focused 100% on what happens to the capital once it's raised - on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.  This is sufficient for most businesses.  Financial services companies, on the other hand, and banks in particular, not only try to invest at above average rates, they also try to source capital at abnormally cheap rates.  In fact, I would argue most of the emphasis for banks is on ""creating value"" via the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  Because of deposit insurance and too big to fail (among other things) there's a large subsidy given to banks by the government on the capital raising side.  Deposits are abnormally cheap and debt capital has an implicit government guarantee.  Only banks can raise capital at such cheap rates.  So banks make most of their money (i.e. their economic rent or value add) from sourcing capital cheaply as opposed to investing it really well.  Ergo ROIC doesn't really help in evaluating a bank.  ROE on the other hand, measures both sides of the balance sheet at once.  Embedded in ROE is the answer to two questions: 1) How well did the company invest it's money?, 2) How cheaply did they raise that money in the first place?.  So if a company (read: bank) is ""making money from both sides of the balance sheet"" the best metric to use is ROE.  Understanding this should also help you understand why banks have so much more leverage than most companies.  It's because the more capital they raised from ""subsidized"" deposits and ""implicitly guaranteed"" debt, the cheaper their capital is.  They're incentivized to load up on debt.  This privilege is only available to banks; so other businesses are not incentivized to load up on debt in the same way.  "
2015-08-19 17:53:58,"You can't use a ROIC/ROCE ratio. The best ratio to use would be ROE. Useful multiples would be P/E, P/Sales, P/AUM, Div Yield, P/B, P/TBV, depending on the firm. Depending on the firm you could use a gordon growth model or a residual income valuation. You're going to want to look at Cost/Income, PBT and Net income. On the balance sheet focus on equity and CET ratios. 

Financials are tricky because its hard to understand the balance sheet changes. Look at the company's statements and especially their presentations where they might emphasise specific KPIs or ratios that are useful to look at for their business.

I wouldn't say you need to fully understand the movements in the balance sheet, but you'd need to be comfortable enough with the business/management in order to accept that lack of understanding. I'm a generalist, but have done some work on and invested in some financials (buy side equity analyst)."

2015-08-19 13:01:58,"You'll want to look at the portfolio and analyze their exposures as best they let you with the information given.  For example - geographical and industry help.  Don't want too many high yield oil loans out there, or too many in the major drilling states.  If it's a bank they may tell you their ALM/duration management strategies in a call with them, and if you believe in interest rates going one way or the other it could be an added portfolio benefit that the street isn't accounting for.  On the equities side I would be skeptical of any venture capital investments that take up a large portion of their equity portfolio but I doubt we would see that with smaller banks too substantially, but similar rules apply as the liability analysis.  

Also, I've noticed that good management tends to prevail here in the deal-making process so make sure they all have a clean history."

2) If our shorts are going up and are longs are going down something is very wrong and we would move to cash. We monitor our exposures and for the most part both books tend to move in tandem. As our longs go up, our shorts go up we are just betting they go up less. As our longs go down, our shorts go down and we are just betting that our longs go down less. We are truly looking at relative performance in that as long as our longs outperform our shorts we make money regardless of what the market does. 

We spend a lot of time reviewing the historical performance of the companies and work at identifying what the key variables are that effect performance. From a management perspective, we like to review what their incentives are and how they align with what we feel the key variables are.

Now lets assume the market is down 14% and once again our alpha is 3.00% on each side. 250% Gross example would still be positive 0.50% and the 100% Gross example would be down -4%. 

2) Corret, we have 50-75 names on the long side and another 50-75 on the short side. So total is anywhere from 100-150. I have 7 analysts that work with me on my book. I don't get too involved in the day to day unless it is in the portfolio. Then I will take meetings with management along with our analysts, participate in earnings calls, and read the company reports. For the most part I let the analyst take the lead and I'm just there. We discuss the names in the portfolio on a daily basis and do a deep dive whenever something of substance changes. If the name spikes or crashes unexpectedly, we will review our thesis and the new information to try to figure out what happened. Our analyst all monitor a specific sector as their primary and another as a secondary, so they are staying on top of all the names in their universe. I only get involved in portfoio names.  "

2016-02-28 01:35:25,"Haven’t looked at ATW but have done some credit work for other offshore drillers (e.g., ORIG). Given their position in the industry as mostly undifferentiated service providers to the E&amp;P / upstream side of the O&amp;G industry (not to mention their very high, uneconomic break-evens) I’m pretty bearish on offshore operators as a whole. Even some of the bonds, which at least has an actual claim on the assets, are worth little more than the optionality value of what is essentially a vastly OTM call on oil prices. 

Some things to be aware of:

1. These assets are worth very little in true liquidation cases. That is, the actual scrap value of the materials making up the rig is very minimal. This goes double for aged fleets versus newer, modernized ones (not sure where ATW is on that spectrum).

2. If you’re buying here on the perception that book value = asset or liquidation value, you’re likely going to be mistaken. Don’t forget that book value is an accounting concept and entirely different than economic value. Rigs cost a lot (therefore creating a high book value) on the presumption that they’ll be valuable on a capitalized earnings basis. When these capitalized earnings go kaput, as they do when the service you are providing is economically unviable, then the book value you’re looking at is vastly overstated versus the economic reality.

3. There are very potent operating leverage forces working against you. I’m sure you know about value traps / the perils of investing in a so-called “melting ice cube.” With no contracts and high daily operating expenses per rig, this business is like an ice cube in a sauna.

4. Increasing revenue over the past 5 years means nothing, especially when capex has been double / triple operating cash flow over the same period. It’s all about looking ahead to the next 5 years. As a corollary to that, historic ROE and ROA also mean nothing. 5 years is a very short time in the context of a commodity-driven business and historically high oil prices.

Again, haven’t looked at ATW so this is just broad thinking about the sector. From what it looks like, ATW has relatively little debt compared to others in the space. But for me, it’s very difficult to make good predictions when the underlying security is highly dependent on something I view as mostly unknowable and unpredictable."

2016-02-28 01:07:20,"Sorry, I don't know if I can but I'll try. You can essentially break down investing returns into beta and alpha. Beta is what can be attributed to just being in the market. Alpha is what you deliver over and above the beta. Our ""alpha signals"" would be how well we really pick stocks. I think we do a decent job, but I can't say with any conviction that we are necessarily better than some of our competitors. Where we are better is on our risk management. I know that our long/short strategy works. However, I know that it doens't work all the time. Knowing this, I am quick to cut my exposure when the market is unfavorable so that I will be around when it turns. Our competitors, while many are good stock pickers and probably better then me and my team, are unwilling to accept that they may be wrong in the short term. When the market turns agianst them, they will double up to catch up. Although that can work in the short term, in a sustained drawdown it can wipe you out. "

2016-02-28 00:34:04,"Not really, identifying the trend is really more of a mechanical process. Identifying inflection points is the hard part! We always overlay portfolio vol and when it spikes we begin reducing our gross exposure wether we are net long or net short. We use an intermediate term trend following model to determin net exposure. We didn't start using this until early 2000's. Our quant team had done some work and should me that it was a valuable overlay and added an element of long volatility exposure to our portfolio. 

Yes, I am frequently fully invested, its usually when vol in my portfolio or the firm spikes that I reduce exposure.

2016-02-27 23:31:01,"My teams edge is our risk management. Our alpha signals are very average at bets. We preform very well relative to our peers because we will adjust our portfolio's net exposure based on the market, similar to a CTA. When there is an uptrend, we are net long. When the market is in a downtrend, we are net short. When the market is flat we will reduce exposure because generall speaking our vol spikes. Our gross exposure is a function of vol. When they market moves against us and isn't favorable for our strategy, we cut exposure. 

I feel like having a mentor or mentors is invaluable. You are hopefully learning from their experience in addition to your own. I think you will eventually learn as much on you own, it will just take more time. 

Our process is very similar to Tiger. Every day it is either a buy or a sell. We don't have any holds. All position sizes are based on price to value so as that changes, our position changes. We will blow out of a position if it moves against us and we cannot exaplain why. We have a very, I dont know, combative process with our team. We debate things ad nauseam and it is a never ending process for us. You have to have thick skin and let things slide off your back. Its just business. 

I don't think the market is efficient, but I do believe it is an efficiency process. Burry is very, very smart. His process has worked very well for him. I don't like talking about my book. I have a friend thats an artist and she is always terrified whenever she does a showing because she is literally putting a piecce of herself out there and that terrifies her. I can relate anytime I talk my book. Early on, I refused to discuss my book. It was easy for me to question myself. Over time, that has become less of an issue for me. I guess I should add that I am completely transparent with investors and will give them as much information as they want, whenever they want it. But talking to outsiders, thats another matter for me. 

Yes, I have lived and helped build out teams in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. I still oversee those teams, but my main focus is on the US. Generally speaking, I feel the less liquid the market, the more oportunities for enterprising investors. With liquidity comes efficiency. "
2016-02-27 23:24:09,They have zero future contracts at the moment. Zero. That is why they are priced like this currently.
2016-02-27 23:12:42,"B School. Our accounting and back office teams have a couple of CPA's, but nobody on the investment side has a CPA. Your knowledge of financial statements would be pretty useful though. Do some research in your spare time, find some ideas and find a manager you can pitch them to. Demonstrate the value you bring to the table. You could be very valuable to a short only type team in uncovering frauds. "
2016-02-27 23:10:25,"Its possible, just not probable. Your best bet would be bringing something to the table. For instance, our energy group was trying to recruit a guy a couple of years ago. He had zero experience in hedge funds and private equity, but he had been the CEO and previously head of business developement for a large publicly traded energy company. He knew about deal structures and had contacts and experience that were valuable to the firm. "
2016-02-27 23:03:29,"Its not that they have access to sources of info the public doesn't, its the way they analyze that info and the conclusions they can draw from that. Right, our firm has entire teams of PhD's that do nothing but research. Their entire job is to make us better and more efficient. Portfolio management, risk management, trade execution, trade structuring, etc. We have another team that does nothing other than develop quantitative models. Everything from trend following to systematic global macro to long/short equity to volatility to HFT. They currently run 20+ seperate strategies and are absolute rockstars. They have access to the exact same info everyone else does and they consistently generate 15% plus returns with shockingly low volatility. The fact they haven't spun out yet is the surprising thing to me. I attribute it to the fact that they have no desire to run anything. They just want to do research and are happy never publishing anything. Landing them and building that capability out was a real coup. 

Some people and some firms absolutely have access to information you don't. In some cases, hedge funds are the ones feeding news the information they want them to have. Reporters are always looking for a story and giving them the narrative you want them to run with is not difficult. From there, you let them run with it and the next thing you know your rumor has now become fact. How do you think reporters find out about companies like Lumber Liquidators? Or when a huge firm blows up like Amaranth, Bear Stearns or Lehman Bros? When you know what their book is and they get a run on the bank, you can easily start trading against them, leak the news to feed the frenzy and then cover your positions as they are forced to unwind. That why you want to avoid the hedge fund hotels and always monitor your liquidity. 

My main sources of info are my Bloomberg terminal, MSCI Barra, company financials, the news, and some sell side research. "
2016-02-27 22:56:44,"Hmm I have been a bit too scared of shit like Ackman this last year. I definitely want to do 20-25. I think I'm competent enough to find that many good ideas :) 
5% is really concentrated still. 

See if I were to lock it away for 20 years I would invest in the equal weight consumer staples index, I personally think it's the most defensive yet economic sector. My favorite. 

Yeah clearly there are is some skill, but I think it's also the downside/upside. Lever beta the hell up, post a 30% return and 10x your Aum overnight, or the whole thing craps out and you take a job somewhere else. The downside/upside is really skewed because it isn't their money, hence its just one really big gamble. I'm not a fan of that at all.... "
2016-02-27 22:47:08,"Dude, if I were running a long only portfolio with a decent lockup so I wasn't concerned about redemptions I would run an 8-12 stock portfolio. Maybe some puts to hedge market risk. 

If I were going away for 20 years and couldn't touch it, I would rock the Permanent Portfolio: 25% each in S&amp;P 500, Long Bonds, Gold and Cash. 

There are some guys out there that are wicked smart and wicked good. Most are charlatans riding a leveraged beta wave. "
2016-02-27 22:45:14,"What's your edge? 

Thoughts on managing money under a mentor and on someone's dime vs going out on your own? Can you learn as much by yourself as you could working under a mentor? 

Does your fund mostly invest in equities or other asset classes as well? How familiar do you have to be with more esoteric assets/derivatives if you work mostly with equities?

Thoughts on conviction vs questioning your own thesis? I guess this is a question regarding psychology: how do you decide when to average down on a position when it's going against you? I read somewhere that Julian Robertson taught his analysts/PMs that a position was always either a buy or a sell, it was never a hold. If it was not a strong buy, at any given time, it was a sell, even if it was down 20% at the time. Would you say you agree with that kind of thinking?

Given that the market is more efficient now, would you say someone like how Burry was back in the '90s could still succeed just by digging through filings by himself in his office? Do you think it's important to have someone to discuss your ideas with?

Also, do you have any experience with European/Asian equities? And if you do, would you say the market is less efficient in say Korea than the U.S., and would there be more opportunities over there for the enterprising investor?

Thanks!"

2016-02-27 22:14:10,"I trade equities, dude. Our macro is all systematic. We don't have any discreationary traders. That being said, I don't see rates going up this year. I really don't see inflationary pressure in the near term, so I won't say its a bad trade. I like the consumer and think they are stronger than most give them credit for. I definitely think the US is the safest place to be, from a currency prospectice and have been bullish on the dollar since 2011-2012. I think we will continue to see dollar strength thru 2021 or so. Strong dollar is bad for commodties and inflationary pressure in general. Great for consumers, industrials and tech. "

2016-02-27 22:00:53,"Great questions and I'll do my best to address them!

1) Our gross exposure is going to be 200-250%. Diversification is our first line of defense. We generally own 50-75 names on both the long and short side. We adjust our net exposure based on market trends, almost like a CTA which gives us an element on being long volatility in our portfolio. Our Gross exposure is a function of volatility. If vol spikes in our portfolio, we reduce exposure aggressively. Live to fight another day. We only play in the $5 billion + space so no liquidity risk. I monitor our liquidity and keep it so that we could liquidate our book in no more than 5 days with a 20% volume constrait. Being illiquid will kill you when you are subject to redemptions. 

2) We break out our universe into deciles by sector. Our long book is comrpised of our top decile names and our short book is comprised of our bottom decile names. We maintain a net neutral sector weight and monitor our factor exposures with MSCI Barra. Genrally speaking, even if you can add 6% of alpha on the short side its still a losing position because markets are going to do 7-10%. The flip side, is because we balance out our positions, we are truly relative in that we only need our longs to go up more than our shorts and vice versa. We haven't entirely removed our beta expsoure though because we are usually either net long or short. A sideways market is tough on us and we really really want it to breakout one way or the other. 

3) All I am looking at is what our analyst have come up with for a valuation. I compare that to the market price and then weight it accordingly. Net position is determined by market action. Gross exposure is a function of portfolio volatility. 

4) All position sizes are a function of price to estimate of valuation. If I were running a long only book and didn't have to worry about redemptions, I would run an 8-12 name book. 

5) Our edge is risk management and how we adjust our portfolio to market conditions. Our alpha signals are honestly pretty average at best. Our value is really that we are going to be long when the market is moving up, short when it is moving down, and we are going to reduce exposure in a sideways market. When the market turns, we are going to get caught, but less so because we are running a fairly balanced book and will only be either 50% net long or short. We add some alpha on both the long and the short side, but not much. Maybe 3-4%.  "
2016-02-27 21:45:52,Do you guys hire people who are not right out of undergrad or mba?  Take any people who worked in a different area of finance for a while and want to transition?
2016-02-27 21:40:20,"If I wanted to jump from analyst at a BB to PM at your firm, what would you need to see to make it happen? Career wise? Investment management side (like own portfolio with track record etc)?"
2016-02-27 21:38:54,"I attribute it to our risk management. Our alpha signals, if you will, are really nothing that spectacular. Instead, we feel like our edge is in how we adjust our exposure, both net and gross. 

For the most part, the entire industry is a freaking sham. Just looking at long/short, you can attribute the returns to two factors: long small caps/short lage cap and long value/short growth or to put it more concisely long small cap value/short large cap growth with a bias towards being net long 75% or so. "
2016-02-27 21:23:14,"My 401k is up 2% this year b/c i a made a hard pivot to fixed income and treasuries. Is that what you guys are looking at?  

How are you guys looking at term structure given that the curve is so flat? "
2016-02-27 21:11:35,"Hey I'm at a long only and something I've come to be very skeptical about the long short strategy in general. I also have tons and tons and tons of questions. 

What's your gross exposure look like? What do you do to manage your shorts going against you and your longs going against you and then blowout of positions etc. I talked to a fund in town (not NYC) that blew out of their shorts to make margin call and now are ultra long in illiquid small caps. Obviously anecdotal but how do you prevent stuff like that? Is it position sizing/risk a management? Do you guys run a lot of positions? What do you do in terms of risk management specifically. 


Something I also wonder about is how you manage your long/short type positions. I find that when I look at others investors they have to take high risk longs to offset the drag of the shorts, which increases tail risk etc. What is your philosophy on shorting, my current boss is pretty much anti shorting as it is often a negative NPV activity over the long term, but I'm still open minded. All I know is never short open ended growth lol.

On another note how much information does it take to feel comfortable with a position? When do you think that is enough and feel comfortable to pull the trigger? 

What is your position sizing philosophy? Do you subscribe to the ""not in my 20th best idea"" or many to kind of smooth results? 

What would you consider your core competence? Like what situations have you found that you've really knocked it out of the park and have strong reads over. I think maybe 1-2 times for me I have found what I thought was gross overreactions to extremely high quality companies and then felt that I could size up, but what is your type of investment? Changing management etc all come to mind.

Apologize for what is a large amount of questions, but reading your other comments the results seem really great and would love to hear what you have to say! Take your time.

Is some investment banking experience at either the analyst or associate level critical to getting into equity hedge funds? "
2016-02-27 20:52:24,"Its all based on what our estimate of fair value vs market price. If we think its worth $180 and its trading at $90, its going to get a pretty good weight in the portfolio but its all based on what else is available at that time. The most attractive risk/reward opportunities get the biggest weight.  "
2016-02-27 20:42:29,"Our firm is over $5 billion AUM. 

My percent changes based on volatility. As the vol spikes, we reduce our exposures. Currently, my gross exposure is a little over $1.5 billion. Generally speaking I manage 15% of the total AUM, but my gross exposure will be 200-250%. 

Sell side isn't a major impact in my day to day decision making. I like a couple of the big picture analyst/strategist and read David Rosenberg and Jan Hatzius for example. If one of my analyst is adamant that we blow out of a position, I'll challenge them, but will most likely go with their recommendation. Usually, the only time we blow out though is as a result of the market. Something happens that we cannot explain. 

Our tunrover is high because we trade around positions daily, but our average holding period for a stock would be around 2-3 years. Thats usually a result of more attractive names becoming available. All our position sizing is a result of the risk/reward or price/value if you prefer. "

2016-02-27 20:14:58,"We keep our book balanced, so we always have short positions to offeset our longs. Because we are long/short we only care about relative performance, that are longs go up more than our shorts and are shorts go down more than our longs. Each analyst is assigned a sector and maintains both a long and short list of names along with his estimate of valuation. If you take the Russell 1000 as a universe, we would only be interested in 20% of the names, the top 10% and the bottom 10% of price to value by sector. Once a name falls out of that decile, we remove it from the watchlist and replace it. Position size is determined by price/value and changes daily. As a short position climbs in value, we would add to the position. As it falls, we would reduce the position. If it spikes and we can't figure out why, we would blow out of the position becuase there is something going on that we don't know. Our time horizon is usually 3-5 years, but sometimes things happen sooner and sometimes it takes longer. Our risk management is all about reducing our CDaR. As the portfolio vol spikes, we cut exposures. If our vol isn't spiking, we adjust to the market. If the market is uptrending, we are net long. If its downtrending, we are net short. If the market is trading sideways we will maintain a neutral to net long bias. If a position spikes on us, we try to figure out why and if we can't rationally explain it, we blow out in a hurry. "

2016-02-27 19:43:35,"We try to remain neutral on our sector exposures. One theme we are biased towards right now though is the consumer. We think the consumer is stronger than they are getting credit for. Gasoline prices alone should account for an additional $300-400 in their pocket vs a couple of years ago and I don't think they can save it. Its going to get spent. 

Dude, I callled the internet bubble about 7 times before I was finally right! I called the mortgage/housing crisis about 15 times before I was right! The biggest lesson I have learned is that you don't want to fight the market. I am very much a fundamental investor at heart and always will be. That being said, I don't fight the market. If its in a downtrend I am going to be net short. If it's in an uptrend, I'm going to be net long. If my volatility is spiking, I'm cutting exposure and collapsing my book. Always manage your downside and the upside will mostly take care of itself. "
2016-02-27 19:37:44,"How do you run the short book different from the long book? For sure, the types of companies in the short book would be very different. My question is more about a) tactically determining when to initiate a position b) how do you go about building the position (short more on rises or on declines?) c) eventual position size on a short compared to a long d) typical time horizon for a short compared to a long e) any risk management that is different for the short book. Would appreciate your insights. Thanks!"
2016-02-27 19:34:41,"haha Yeah, but I'm biased. Our flagship fund is designed to be a LIBOR + 5-7% type product with very low volatility. There is also a 2x version of that. We offer some other products as well, but those two are the biggest by assets. Our group has done well, we were down 5% in 2008 and that has been the only down year since I started trading here back in 1999. 2008 was brutal, everything went down so unless you were net short you didn't make any money. Our risk controls both saved us and hurt us that year. They saved us becasue we ended up going to cash when volatility spiked, but they hurt us because instead of going net short we stayed in cash. Redemptions were a bitch as well. After some funds started putting their gates up, investors started looking for money anywhere they could get it and we were liquid. "
2016-02-27 19:26:19,"2015 was a decent year for us. Our group was up 11% and the firm as a whole finished up 6% and change for the year net of fees. So far this year, our group is up 2% or so and the firm is flat for the year. "

I used to think it was just a sales role and you would never do any of your own research, but the more I learn, you can set up your business however you want and manage the investments however you want, if you set it up correctly from the get go.

I found out late in my first degree (which I had switched to poli sci from architecture) that one of my passions was finance/econ/investing, and it was just too little, too late to change things, so I just ended up going back for a different degree. I realized even now with the advanced degree in finance that I could do everything I love now about investments and finance, not even being involved in the finance industry professionally. I could have stuck with the architecture degree and still done my investment projects on the side, and been perfectly happy, probably even more wealthy. 

Bottom line. If you have more than one passion besides finance and investments, and can do what you love in finance without making that your profession, I'd advise you to do the other. You can have the best of both worlds. In my case, I could be an architect and still an investor. But I couldn't be a finance professional and still be an architect. It just wouldn't work."

2016-09-06 14:52:31,"&gt; You need to understand the industry (government spending) to understand whether the company's operating models makes sense or not.

I don't think you understand my point, or maybe I'm not getting it across the right way. I do understand this industry and have spent the past month working on this idea. What I'm saying is that I don't need to know the exact numerical figure of public spending for the next few years to become comfortable with this idea. 

This is a business that has grown earnings at a mid-single digit rate over the past two years (arguably their biggest years business wise) that the market is pricing for 35%+ earnings growth over the next two years. There's just no way. 

If you read my report you will see that their main earnings driver, the stun gun business, has been propped up by unsustainable price increases and even tiny variations in that pricing completely craters earnings. Is that not a bad business to you? 

Re: catalyst. I again disagree. Right now that market thinks TASR is the *only* player in the body camera market and can repeat the the monopoly they have on the stun gun market because their competitors are either 1) small and lesser followed, 2) private companies, or 3) obscure segments within larger tech companies. This lawsuit with Digital Ally that I point out is woefully underfollowed and when it becomes a well known issue (when it goes to trial) it will completely break the idea that TASR can continue uncontested in the body camera market, and that they will also be unable to create a monopoly on body cameras. This will happen by November/December. 

I disagree with your hedge point. It doesn't make sense for me to make an investment in a sub-par idea just to hedge something. See David Einhorn's comments on pair trades for further explanation of that idea. 

"
2016-09-06 14:35:56,"You need to understand the industry (government spending) to understand whether the company's operating models makes sense or not.

I wouldn't act on this idea though because the industry theme (mainly public sentiment; see Mylan as an example) against it is too strong, and you haven't found a strong enough catalyst for them to significantly lag the overall industry. Shorting is much better when you long something else to hedge it. An unhedged short should ideally be one where the product or operating model so obviously sucks so much that the emerging knowledge of its shittiness is the catalyst  (e.g. it's fraudulent). "
2016-09-06 13:58:37,"&gt; Why do you find it to a poor investment strategy?

I'm not smart enough to try and guess market tops and bottoms, and I have no special insight into why policy makers will make particular decisions, so I try to base my investment strategy off of a company's fundamentals and operating model. 

But like I said, when a situation (such as with TASR) is linked to what the government decides to do with their money, I can see what sort of expectations that market has priced into the stock and how their fundamentals react to it. 

That said, I think public safety spending will continue to be a thing, just not as much as everyone else thinks. This has two implications 1) TASR will not be able to continue price gouging on the stun gun side, and 2) increased body camera competition (where they have no competitive advantage) will not allow them to reach the critical mass necessary to achieve operating scale. 

I don't need to worry about whether certain bills are passed, or what spending looks like under a republican/democrat congress because when you get down to it federal spending is only part of the equation. There is also state and municipal spending. To try and figure out where each of the three are going would cause one to miss the forest for the trees and I don't think its an appropriate use of time when I can just figure out the overall trend (flat to modestly down).

2016-09-05 21:00:14,"Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0

The reason stocks are rallying in the absence of earnings growth is because we are in the deleveraging phase of the long-term debt cycle. This is where the excess credit in the system is reduced to match the actual level of productivity in the economy. 

The tools used by policymakers to close the gap are austerity/debt payoff and printing of money. The former is deflationary while the latter is inflationary. That's why the US dollar hasn't really seen much inflation despite the increased money supply, because the excess credit in the system is slowly being phased out in favor of actual money.

As more credit is reduced, more money is printed. This has the effect of keeping prices high despite the absence of productivity growth, because to market participants money and credit are the same thing. The goal of policymakers however is to reduce credit, not control prices, so there's a slight asymmetry of goals between the system and those within the system with regards to money supply policy. 

As a result, what you're seeing is prices being maintained at pre-deleveraging levels, while productivity slowly catches up, until the balance is restored. The end result, or at least the one policymakers hope for, is that i) credit is reduced to normal levels, ii) productivity has increased to match the increased money supply, and iii) money doesn't experience too much inflation. 

So if things play out the way they're expected to, we'll just see markets stagnate at artificially ""high"" levels, until real productivity growth catches up. "
2016-09-05 20:55:59,"tl;dr  mrkt is mispricing equity due to opacity around earnings power due to a cluster fuck of balance sheet activity around m&amp;a squared and timing of cap ex cycle that is peaking and depressing fcf.  

if you normalize for this (e.g. cap ex) &amp; normalize for that (e.g. synergies) you have a company trading at a market fcf multiple growing at least twice as fast in a secular growth market with limited competition due to industry characteristics.    "

Aw, I kind of felt bad for Zuck here. This guy like rips him apart (Zuck is no Bill Gates!!). Lol, like yeah, I do suspect FB is overvalued (not going to bet against it though like a moron). The WhatsApp deal was good though, in my opinion. Not sure about the Instagram deal; though I love using Instagram, I doubt they would be anywhere as massive as they are now without Facebook's being their umbrella organization; versus Facebook messenger noticeably improved post the WhatsApp deal. They just need to convert the WhatsApp people into Facebook or else put up some profitably enough advertising so that the users keep using WhatsApp.

I would definitely consider owning $FB at some point though, just not now, for sure.

I'm doubtful this is worse than the dot.com mania. Facebook isn't going away, at least anytime soon. That particular bubble is ""crystallizing."" 

Yeah he kind of has a printing press. Yeah he's probably going to burn a lot of money. I just kind of shrug at this part and don't have many opinions or feelings on it.

Those other companies are maturing, this is a natural thing to happen in industries, while new companies are showing they are much more productive than the average existing company (a good thing).

I pin the blame on our existing education system, it hasn't enabled people with the skills that allow them to react to changing realities in the economy. Instead there's a lot of dumb focus on standardized tests, test taking, test prepping, grit, and just general pushing a dumb worker bee mentality due to our current retarded political system. There's also probably some minor issue with not enough small town banks helping fund new small businesses on Main Street due to onerous regulations mis-written for the banks too big to fail or something like that."

4. let me google that for you
5. bad companies needs to reinvest in order to maintain, better companies reinvest for growth, even better growth without investment. for example, if coca cola needs to spend 10B -&gt;additionally&lt; a year on ads in order to maintain its revenue, then obviously its worth a lot less today. Or a railroad company for example, if it needs to maintain tracks, or if a competitive sales company need to hire more sales. in summary, if the business is ultra competitive, and it's a bad business, though they make money, they would make less each year if significant investment is put back into the hole.

this guy is a little too much theory, i mean in reality you should be able to avoid traps as you see them for what they are. in the last question if you see a company that generate significant income, with no dividend, no acquisitions, etc etc, and no increase in ""real"" equity, then obviously something is wrong."

2016-09-05 10:06:48,"Re: real estate - The money has more to do with the Fannie/Freddie government interference (they artificially lower interest rates in a misguided attempt to increase home ownership rates and a bullshit version of the American Dream) along with the fact that most people are not entrepreneurs--most are working for others and their income depends on the employer in their locale. Those workers are indeed not often using their home as productive assets. It's not a bad thing. 

Yes, they take little risk because they can push it onto the taxpayer. However, again that's the government's problem; my point about that banks can be induced to make loans by using collateral (or track record, or market knowledge, but collateral is the best and real estate is one of the best types of collateral) to lend money responsibly holds true. It's also not that troubling if the majority of people use loans to finance homes; they do have to live somewhere, and getting a loan for it, allows one to move away at the beginning of their career rather than the end of it (would you rather live in a society where people live with their parents for ~30 years until they can finally afford to move out, or worse, a society where people can only move out if their family has enough generational wealth to support their own children while letting the poor have to settle for staying poor)? The other bullshit is how the government pretends houses are the a good place to store wealth for the middle class. No. Not at all. I can go into a rant about this, but I'd rather not for now because it's exhausting. 

Yes, I think you are correct about the exorbitant amounts of money going towards things that are not funding productive activities. Yellen seems aware of this, she is just not going to put it bluntly like that as the decent leader she is. Instead, she has been subtly pushing responsibility towards general policymakers. People are yelling at the Fed for causing the problem; but again, this isn't the appropriate place to direct blame. Our executive policymakers are the appropriate authority to be yelling at. The Fed is doing a good job with what they are tasked to do; they are managing monetary policy so that people are not mass starving or rioting in the US. 

The Fed is like the construction guys that are filling potholes on the highway. The roads are safe enough to drive on. But they are not responsible or have the toolkit to change the extreme traffic or weather conditions that are constantly causing those potholes. That's on our executive policymakers to think about and fix (and using this analogy, I don't think the optimal solution is to repave the road and/or encourage people to disperse to the suburbs and take public transportation back in at all, which is essentially what the analogous policies that many politicians back).

2016-09-04 05:43:56,"perhaps someone else could help out with the technicals (2+4)

1) Might be anecdotal, but I find that the funds with the best returns really do have an intense focus on a specific discipline of value investing. Whether that be finding net-nets, special situations, compounders or even certain geographies and markets. It's certainly not a disadvantage to be a generalist, but I do think it's an advantage to be specific to a certain strategy. See Curreen capital (spinoffs), Riskowitz capital (south african compounder focus, some 35%+ returns) and Denali capital (Malone feitsh dude, spinoffs and special situations)

2) well the whole premise of a DCF is assumptions on ""variables"" - assuming revenue growth, margin expansion/contraction etc etc. Obviously a lot can change in 5-10 years and you're essentially trying to forecast the future, as such, DCF's are really just assumptions based on changing variables and then discounting fcf to PV.

3) Just some thoughts here - why not use goodwill as well in ""reproduction costs""? That's certainly a factor as well as SG&amp;A and R&amp;D when trying to replicate a company. I'd also put weight on the cost of assets, especially if it's a capex heavy industry - what's the cost basis of a factory on the b.s etc.

5) I think you would be right regarding your logic for maintenance capex. But I believe that quote is referring to growth capex. Some industries, i.e low moat industries, think airlines - say one airline is experiencing high levels of passenger growth (winning market share), this has to be followed up with large growth capex in aircraft (the reinvestment in the business). I mean, its not really being given back to shareholders, right? Especially given the average airlines destroy invested capital. 

The best businesses are able to scale without constant reinvestment, i.e capital light compounders so as to return the free cash flow back to shareholders via buybacks, dividends, acquisitions etc etc. Perhaps someone can chime in and give a good example."

&gt;. In one recent quarterly earnings announcement, for example, Musk unveiled pro-forma figures that lowered Tesla’s official loss almost a quarter by eliminating “stock-based compensation expense” from total costs. As Warren Buffett argues, equity options and restricted shares are a real cost—and correctly treated as such under GAAP—because they cause dilution by shrinking the share of earnings that go to existing shareholders.

correct, but it doesn't hurt Tesla's cash flow. Surely it is a real cost when considering valuation, but when calculating whether the business is solvent or not it's quite irrelevant."

paywall:

How do you separate a department store chain from its debt? Hudson’s Bay is trying to find out.

The owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord and Taylor is in talks to buy Neiman Marcus Group, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Hudson’s Bay wants to buy Neiman’s assets, but not the retailer’s $5 billion in debt. Hudson’s Bay’s own debt already stands at a hefty 5.6 times estimates for its fiscal 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company declined to comment on the deal but said it looks for opportunities to grow “while maintaining or enhancing its credit profile.”

The unconventional arrangement may seem like a relatively low-risk proposition for Hudson’s Bay, but Neiman’s bondholders aren’t likely to love it. The company, which was purchased by its current private-equity owners for $6 billion, including debt, in 2013.

Last fall, Neiman’s lenders allowed it to extend the maturity on its credit line from 2018 to 2021, buying it some time. The company scrapped its plans to go public in January.

For bondholders, the deal may be the best payoff they can hope for. Neiman’s bonds have fallen more than 11% this year and yield more than 10%, according to FactSet.

Sales at Neiman have been in steep decline, falling 6.7% to $2.47 billion in the 26 weeks ended Jan. 28. The company reported a net loss of $140.6 million for the period.

Neiman debt holders now face a choice between continuing the long march toward bankruptcy and an unpalatable deal that at least gives them something. Investors in other debt-laden retailers should beware. "

It was also a good place for parents to bring kids. Its just boring now.

2017-03-14 01:59:32,"Tesla says it will get a 20%+ margin on the Model 3. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. In either case, it's certainly not easy, it's incredibly hard, which is why most of Tesla's engineers work on designing the factory to build the Model 3 rather than the Model 3 itself. Tesla does actually have a coherent argument here as to why it's different from any other car maker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Szj2qIYX8 Elon Musk has never actually failed to deliver on a grandiose promise before, like returning rockets from orbit and landing them with the precision of a helicopter. He's only been late. The Gigafactory may not live up to Musk's promises, but hey, I think he's earned some credibility at this point. 

Tesla doesn't do marketing. It doesn't need to. The UBS estimate that it will cost $8 billion to build out the supercharger network misunderstands the purpose of superchargers. UBS bases its estimate on achieving the same coverage as gas stations. Superchargers aren't designed to replace gas stations. Superchargers are intended for long-distance travel only. You're meant to charge at home or use destination chargers for everyday charging. "
2017-03-14 00:36:28,"I work in commercial real estate and have been intimately involved in several B/C mall transactions in recent years. I've got a couple thoughts on this.


* Generally anchor tenants like Macy's or sears own their underlying real estate or operate under low rate long term leases. This means any income from these tenants is at most a couple $100k annually, usually not enough to throw one of these malls into default. The much larger issue comes from cotenancy clauses in other tenant leases. This means if Macy's decides to close, someone like H&amp;M who would otherwise be locked in on a 10 year lease now has the right to either terminate their lease or stay open but only pay a fraction of their previous rent. The cascading effect this can have is what really pushes these malls over the edge. Macy's is probably a curveball, but a lot of the smart operators have seen the writing on the wall and negotiated their leases to avoid this where possible.


* CMBS debt has been difficult to come by on favorable terms for enclosed malls for nearly 10 years. We are at the tail end of the ""wall of maturities"" and will see the last round of CMBS 1.0 defaults coming up shortly. After that, any deals from 2010 - present in enclosed malls have really not been priced aggressively. Underwriting standards for loans have increased dramatically. High cap rate cash buyers have really dominated the REO and second tier market, which is where these closures are likely to occur anyway.


* Strong malls or those in A markets (like those owned by GGP or Simon) actually want these anchors out in a lot of situations. Redevelopment into lifestyle pieces or even just splitting the box and adding junior anchors like tjx or dicks sporting goods have been strong value add plays at a lot of malls. Think of what kind of value seritage is trying to unlock.

Overall, I'm glad I don't work exclusively with malls, but the situation is a lot more nuanced than people give credit for."

2017-03-13 22:39:12,"Why are you comparing margins earned on a $100k car and a $150k SUV with a $35k car (that is not gonna average that much  after options btw, it's going to be more like $45k to 50k which is NOT mass market). 

DO you think the margins on a 3 and 7 series are the same, or a C and S class? Obviously the margins Tesla makes are due to the high sticker prices, there's no way they can compete in the mass market and earn the same. 

If it were so easy, why don't BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Toyota, Honda, Lexus etc. do it? You CAN assume that Tesla's margin will be thin because they have NOTHING that other manufacturers can't and haven't copied. 

Also, gross margins don't mean anything when you have to cover marketing, G&amp;A, R&amp;D, cash taxes, and cash interest as well. 

The other thing you're missing is that lets say Tesla has 400k cars on the road. Where are they all going to go to charge and get serviced? If Tesla wants to build out a service and charging network, that's going to cost upwards of $15bn (UBS estimates $18bn). Those are slim margin businesses, and returns on capital are poor (as they are in cars), so as a shareholder who stands at risk of being diluted, I would question why I'm funding projects with a ROIC of ~10% when my cost of capital should be 15 to 20% for a company as risky as Tesla.

So Tesla's margin in the car business is pretty high. It claims it can do a 20%+ gross margin on the Model 3 as well, once high-volume production gets going. 

Some share dilution in 2017 is very likely, but it seems unlikely to exceed market cap growth in the long term. I'm not sure at what point Tesla will become profitable. It's a difficult decision because taking a profit now can mean foregoing growth and future profit."

Don't forget teslas other businesses in batteries and cars and solar are capital intensive, incredibly competitive, and unlikely to yield high margins. I hate when people compare Tesla to Apple becuase the unit economics are totally different and that is perhaps the largest reason Apple is valued as it is today.

I usually just stay logged in in the background while I'm working and I check my dashboard with all of my watch list of stocks occasionally throughout the day. I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

2017-03-12 12:04:17,Buysiders are much more generalist.  Only the fidelities of the world have the scale to have an analyst cover 20 companies. 
2017-03-12 10:54:05,"Depending on who you ask, you'll get radically different answers.

There are sentiment cycles, that I think are best explained by the confluence of good/bad economic conditions, posture vis a vis risk and biology. A good paper on the biology is 'From Molecule to Market'. If you accept that the wider economy is cyclical, then it's not a stretch to suggest credit spreads would also be cyclical.

Equity valuations also exhibit something approaching a sentiment cycle.

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1538/331

Some cycles are caused simply by the long lags before supply stimulated by higher price comes online. I think that's probably true of most of the commodity complex.

Same goes for shipping. Pops in shipping rates are caused by high levels of fleet utilisation. The pops stimulate supply, which eventually flattens rates."
2017-03-12 10:40:46,"I am no expert, and won't claim to be... But I'll take a stab at it.

Similar to how people need sleep, society tends to funnel necessities into specific time frames.

Growth is necessary during certain times, and harmful during others. I feel that there are many organic, as well as intentional, affects to balance growth. This balance creates a cycle.

I may be very confused, so I urge you to take this as solely opinion, rather than being empirically verified. "
2017-03-12 10:32:14,"But do you understand what I mean by the difference between a cycle and a random walk? There is a ""sleep cycle"" because the period (~ 24 hours) is relatively constant. But the plot of the number of red cars I see per day shouldn't really exhibit cyclicality (I'm sure there would be some ""day of the week"" effect or something).

So why are the credit markets cyclical?"

2017-03-12 10:20:57,For this reason I like to see management both competent and have stake in the company. A bad example of this would be the CEO of stanley furniture.

2017-03-12 10:02:25,"Not sure how to explain it, it's more a question of english than finance.  I'll try with a real life example:

My taste in women is cyclical, I go from blondes to brunettes; at the top of the blonde cycle I go for looks like Indra Petersons, while at the top of the brunette cycle I go for looks like Jaimie Alexander.

Usually the cycles are pretty regular in 6-months cycles, but often I might fall in love for someone new at random intervals especially if I meet someone with a hardbody like Lauren Drain."

2017-08-23 07:46:00,"Well they manage like $100Billion so they are probably doing many things. But treasury exposures seem like one of the more likely places to *tactically* reduce risk. For example Congress needs to pass new spending budget and debt ceiling measures ASAP after they get back from their vacations or there will be a government shutdown first week of October. Congress passing ANYTHING at all is never easy, even when tensions and conflicts are not as high as they are now. So that's not good. 

Bridgewater could be hedging their Treasury exposure via derivatives and/or tactically choosing certain spots on the yield curve to move out to. But in this case, actual CASH (NOT EQUIVALENTS) seems like a particularly appropriate choice in the short term. One can add a USD currency hedge layered on top of this as the dollar may weaken further. "

All these are private companies. The valuation process is different for each. Also, in cases of large established private companies (e.g. Cargill or Mars...) while many of the techniques one would use are similar to how comparable public companies are analyzed, there are key differences for private companies. Most notably. valuation multiples on private companies tend to be lower vs comparable public companies...When analyzing a larger private company, private equity firms or investment banks or whoever is doing it, often will estimate both ""if public"" and ""if private"" valuations for a company."

2017-08-22 06:02:59,"It's pretty much the same as with a public company, if you do not have the financial figures, there is really now way you are going to be able to evaluate it.

As for where to get the figures, if it's a big company like Uber, there has been plenty of information leaked about how much they charge, their burn rate, debt situation, capital raises, billings. With enough work, you can slowly piece it together and get a rough picture of the company's financial situation. Someone with a good grasp of accounting would be able to do this with uber despite the limited financial data.

There are also databases of data but you would have to pay and the availability is going to come down to the legislation in that particular country. Or if you have enough money and are interested in buying a substantial stake in the company then you will likely get access to the books.

So you basically have two options, either have enough money to pay for some sort of data service or have good enough accounting and investigation skills that you can sort of piece together a picture of the financial statements based particular data that is publicly available.

Since you're new to this, I would recommend sticking to public companies and working to understand everything about accounting that you can.

2017-08-22 03:13:05,"For a stock pitch in equity research, I think you would be better off using an income statement model to calculate EPS because future corporate earnings growth is the main factor that drives stock performance. A more efficient method would be to forecast revenue segment growth and EBIT margin to forecast future EPS, and using P/E for upside/downside/base cases. DCF models, while being the most detailed, are better off for entire business valuations so they reign in IB and private equity. For equity research, they're too time consuming due to all the time you will use up talking to contacts and filtering out the good information from the noise (source: took an equity research class as an elective, my professor was an ER analyst and associate director at Morgan Stanley)."

It is not about making 100% of the voters happy, it is about the most supported option winning. That can leave 49.9% 'unhappy', but that is how the system is meant to work.

2017-08-21 20:57:56,"While I'm at it, let me briefly cover what I think is the number #1 problem with ""novice"" equity research. 

They practice what I refer to as ""elevator analysis"". (See 95% of SeekingAlpha, /r/investing, Zacks, etc research). 

An elevator analysis occurs when the analyst will regurgitate trends in revenue, margins, earnings, etc by way of saying ""Revenue was up ~10% YoY"", or ""the Company's forward P/E ratio is at a 20% premium to the comparable average"". So on so forth. 

This is a tricky position young analysts fall into because to them it FEELS like they're communicating good information and producing a work product, but they're actually completely missing the point of where analysts add value. 

I don't need you to tell me revenue went up or down, or that the multiple is at a premium/discount to historical/comparable averages. I'm capable of arriving at those conclusions myself with a simple glance at the numbers. 

What you should focus on is the WHY behind those metrics. 

WHY did revenue go up 10%? WHY did margins increase 150bps when consensus only modeled 50bps? WHY did the Company only repurchase $20mn worth of shares over the year when they said they were going to retire $100mn? (Hint: Its probably because management are idiots and didn't realize a $100mn buyback announcement would put them in a position to be shaky on a principal payment). 

If you can learn to identify the cause/effect relationships behind the numbers, and succinctly communicate the story underpinning the financials, you will be a valuable asset wherever you work. "
2017-08-21 20:56:13,"This is all great information that I really needed. I appreciate this very much. So, it sounds like I should spend most my time preparing for interviews by just learning the business' and their industries. Would you agree?"
2017-08-21 20:46:03,"&gt;What exactly would you mention in this section of a stock pitch though? 

My methodology may vary from some, but in my opinion a perfect pitch has the framework of something like - two thesis points which will effect earnings, one thesis point on something structural with the business that is underappreciated and adds and extra ""oompf"" to the thesis. You don't need to have all of that, but I've found that to be my sweet spot when evaluating the quality of my ideas. 

But anyway, my pitches are structured so that I walk through my points which will effect earnings/EBITDA/whatever...so that by the time I get to the valuation its more like ""Yea so I just told you why EPS will be $0.25 instead of $1.00, the business is already trading at 10x so instead of $10.00 the equity is worth $2.50"" and call it a day. 

Edit: It's my opinion that analysts who underwrite multiples expansion/contraction in their security analysis take on unnecessary, non-fundamental risk. I bet you 9/10 times if you strip out changes in the multiple in this work you'll find the underlying EPS/EBITDA numbers to be in-line, or within the margin of error, of consensus estimates. This is not good because in these cases what ends up driving your thesis is market sentiment/judgement rather than changes in business fundamentals the market is not expecting. 

&gt;How much time would it take to prep a stock pitch?

Depends on the complexity of the idea and how much time you need to work it out. I've been assigned a stock to look at and pitch for an interview and had 2 weeks to throw something together, but I know people who've had ~1 week or less. But generally if you're going in to interview for a buyside/research it is expected that you'll already have pitches prepared.

&gt;Anything else I should know to be prepared for interview?

Buyside/research interviews are very different than the typical investment banking process. You can find loads of interview guides with technical questions that you can memorize/regurgitate and as long as you don't come off as a psychopath you can land an investment banking position. Doesn't work that way with investing. Within the first 5 minutes I can tell if the person I'm speaking with is truly passionate about research/investing or if they just saw the earnings potential for a $1bn hedge fund under 2&amp;20 and decided thats what they wanted to do. 

I will tell you that NONE of my buyside interviews actually felt like ""interviews"". They were all basically just shooting the shit about stocks with whomever I was speaking with, and I honestly think thats the way they should go/feel. This experience ranges from meeting with folks at no-name, sub &lt; $1bn funds to top HFs. As far as I'm concerned there isn't a difference in the type of person who works at either sort of place when they have the passion for investing.

So really your main goal should be communicating that you have the passion and drive for investing. Though getting this point across is largely qualitative, so I don't really think there are any internet resources out there which will help with that. "
2017-08-21 20:45:20,Makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the feedback.
2017-08-21 20:38:16,Becoming a competent business analyst is far more valuable than financial modeling. 
2017-08-21 20:38:12,"Good on you for being ambitious. DCF &amp; other valuation templates should be the core of your quantitative analysis. That said -- and I'll just be succinct -- a model is only as good as its underlying assumptions. In the case of a DCF, you should be able to qualitatively justify your (1) revenue growth outlook, (2) margin trends, (3) terminal growth rate and/or EV/EBITDA multiple, etc.

Those assumptions serve as the core of any good stock pitch and will only hold weight if you do the requisite background research (both company &amp; industry specific) AND synthesize your findings in a creative manner (this means not relying on the consensus). In my mind, this is where the real fun lies; formulating a thesis allows you to add your own touch to a presentation and is much more fruitful than plugging in numbers into an Excel model.

To summarize, models belong in the appendix of your stock pitch. They should complement a qualitatively-based stance that is both creative and sound from a logical perspective."
2017-08-21 19:41:33,"When I was first learning I'd go through 10Ks&amp;Qs, investor presentations, and earnings transcripts and would consult textbooks when I came across concepts I didn't understand.

What exactly would you mention in this section of a stock pitch though? How much time would it take to prep a stock pitch?
 
Anything else I should know to be prepared for interview?

 
"
2017-08-21 19:31:58,"This was not harsh at all, more of a dose of reality. For someone that is trying to understand businesses, do you think it'll be better to go more textbook or to jump into the 10-k's, q's, etc? If you do recommend the textbook route, any specifics? "
2017-08-21 19:16:53,"&gt;I am hoping to use these models for stock pitches during an interview for entry-level positions in asset management and equity research mainly.

Alright, so I'm gonna stop you right there give a dose of tough love. 

If I were interviewing a candidate for a research position, and they handed me a MODEL of their DCF I would auto-ding them. Why? Because it doesn't take any effort at all to find a DCF template online, plug in your Co's. historical #s, dart throw some assumptions and come out with a target price. The target price of a DCF is NOT the purpose of a DCF. 

The point of your valuation is to stress test your operating assumptions and key value drivers under different scenarios - usually base, bull, and bear. 

What asset managers/equity research folks want to see in competitive candidates is the ability to synthesize and critically think about businesses - what they do, how they operate, what makes them successful/tick, etc. Whether someone can put together a solid valuation model is really not a concern...at least not of mine. If a candidate comes in and can talk for hours about how consensus' estimates of $3.00 forward earnings is bullshit, but doesn't even know how to open an Excel worksheet, I will take them over an excel wizard every time. 

I'm not sure how much fundamental work you've done on your company, and I could be way off on this, but the fact that you said you haven't built an operating model yet makes me think you haven't done much yet. 

If you're going to post the DCF for us...at least include some bullets on how you came up with your assumptions. How are you coming up with your revenue growth rates? They all appear to be hard coded except for Y5 which is an average. You have operating margins expanding from 12% to 15%...why? How? Why is D&amp;A and capex increasing as a % of revenue? Why is 8x an appropriate EBITDA multiple to assume? 

The point I'm trying to make is that there is SO much more to fundamental analysis than putting together a DCF. Your time would be much better spent figuring out the business and answering the above questions than spending hours on a valuation model. Really, your valuation should take no more than 5 minutes at the end of the day and I can't really think of the marginal benefit of spending hours on a DCF rather than a quick back of the envelope calculation. 

As a candidate what you should be focusing on is how you can add value to a senior analyst through your understanding of a repeatable research process and business acumen. When I was interviewing for an analyst position practically the entire interview sessions were just chatting about stocks and going over my pitches. Do you wanna know how much time was spent on the valuation part? Maybe 1-2 minutes explaining why I used a certain approach and that was it. 

Sorry if this comes off as harsh, but I'd rather you spend your time working hard in the right direction rather than the wrong direction. "

Couple of thoughts.  Capex&lt;da implies your capital is shrinking while the business is growing.  Most likely not realistic esp in terminal year since at infinite it would mean you invested capital is zero.

Investing is not mostly luck, it's more like backgammon, using one of his analogies from the show.

2018-10-06 20:11:56,"He was likely referring to 1P and 2P reserves. It's very weird to trade below PDP because PDP is nearly certain. However, more importantly, PDP doesn't account for G&amp;A or tax so you should burden it with that if you want a true value 

OP didn't say it is inventory, he said it's the closest thing you get to inventory. I agree it's not a great analogy, especially since drillers refer to unbooked locations as inventory.

According to this article, current AUM is $5.5bn, with $1bn of his own, and $1bn of greenlight re.  So like you said, mostly external - $3.5bn.

At peak, the AUM was supposedly $12bn.  Let's simplistically assume that all of those 3 buckets declined by say 20%, since peak until current (weighted avg) - based on me eyeballing those returns since 2014 and assuming some negative contribution from 2018.  That takes the capital to $9.6bn.

Delta between $9.6bn and $5.5bn is $4.1bn, which implies that most of the external capital has already gone out of the door (only $3.5bn left), even allowing for the 20% assumption (which tbh I think is unrealistic - I'm guessing a meaningful amount would have started going from mid-2015 onwards).

Also I wouldn't be surprised if more capital has left since that article from the start of July... given worse performance as well as that article."

2018-10-05 11:32:52,"What analyst was that?

I'd like to read the rest of the note but that sounds about right.

I'm surprised they would say Q3 was strong. Everything I've heard is that Q3 was looking soft (at least relative to analyst consensus) for all the pumpers.

I think the fall was/is due to overall negative sentiment in Canada around oil and gas. I think the KML pipeline facing delays exacerbated it and we've been in a downspiral ever since. There has been zero good news since then (outside of LNG Canada which mind bogglingly didn't move any of the stocks).

Additionally, there's been bad weather in Alberta. Unlike the southern US, Canada's q2 is their weakest for the pumpers because all the snow melts and makes it impossible to drill because everything is essentially a muddy bog. They call this spring breakup. Unfortunately, the weather has included a ton of snow causing similar conditions (some colloquially call it a fall breakup) which has softened capex in Q3 and that will leak into q4 as the weather is continuing.

I don't see any long term reasons we would see a significant downturn in pressure pumping. Canada is relatively transitory right now and once pipeline capacity starts to come online spreads should close and capex should pickup. I've read in the US we're starting to see a bit less intensity on the fracking side but nothing concerning. 

I don't understand how the analyst doesn't see any near term catalysts. Positive capex budgets from E&amp;P companies would be a near term catalyst.

TCW is the only stock that should be getting hammered since they're a Canadian pure play. Even the selling there is overdone.

I think STEP has been hit harder than the other two because of it's small float and it can't catch a bid right now. I'm waiting for a bit more of a technical chart sign to add since it could drop further before it bounces.

I think we're at max negativity (or near it) at this point. Shorts have piled in in Sept so there could be a squeeze at some point

EDIT: I reviewed some recent industry reports and Step also has had some issues in drilling with their Oklahoma assets. I'm assuming it's related to Alta Mesa who is another stock that is getting absolutely crushed, but this is another thing that I expect to be transitory with oil prices moving higher and the Permian going into full drive once capacity constraints are relieved next year "

&amp;#x200B;

Just a question what distinguishes the economics from markets analysis to the economics from macro analysis? I ask as, if I recall correctly, they look at the same data. Albeit, econometrics looks at it from a more quantitative/statistical approach. (Assuming I'm right in assuming econometrics is almost identical to quantitative analysis.)"

2018-10-04 17:06:11,"If you want to do markets analysis then focus on economics and econometrics. Though keep in mind it's not going to make you any much better at predicting the future, so if your aim is to do markets analysis so as to trade short term positions, you will likely lose a lot of money.

If want to do securities analysis then focus on learning fundamental investing of the various securities and how to analyze businesses.

If you want to macro-economic analysis then I think you should start with some micro and macro economics courses on cousera or one of those platforms
"
2018-10-04 16:35:04,"At present my goal is getting better at macro analysis, alongside general market analysis. 

My other goal is educational, in that I'd like to know the differences.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for an educational perspective, I'd like to know the types of analysis and differs them. I know types like technical, sentiment (the concept, not any method) and the basics of company analysis. 

Though I noticed you differentiated economic analysis and macro analysis- I was under the notion that they were the same?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of how I define the stuff:

Markets analysis, I believe is financial markets analysis-- I guess analysing the capital markets in terms of how they would with trading with charts. Though, I believe it is financial markets analysis after your post which you outlined is broad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Securities, I would imagine stocks/bonds/derivatives based on my limited knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps, if you need me to clear up any more, please let me know. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit off-topic:

I suppose what would help if I knew of any books/reading which goes into the different types of financial markets analysis. As you said, it is broad, so something like a reference/text book guide which goes into what each type is and how they're conducted in practice would help. 

I know the first reply would be ""check the sidebar"", but I've looked into a few sidebars and there's nothing about financial analysis in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Would he have sold at $170 then? If so, how is that a long time holding? That is the basic issue with all of these positions: you go in based on discount to NAV, inevitably you find out that NAV wasn't what you thought it was, and then you hold because...well, you are in it now.

If you are going to do this, ignore NAV and look at the underlying growth in whatever it is that you own (and don't buy based on NAV then hold based on some other idea).

And don't write a post on this either. Unless you an odd person, you are not going to be able to sell after this post. If you choose to bail, fine post about it because it is done. But if you are holding on, writing about it is like strapping yourself to the wheel as it goes down. That doesn't mean holding is a bad idea, writing about it definitely is though."

2019-10-22 02:09:45,A DCF valuation is a DCF valuation. Value investing is irrelevant to doing a DCF analysis properly. Perhaps you're going about this the wrong way? Get a book for DCF analysis and get a book for value investing. Take the ideas from both and apply it for yourself in the way you want to.

“The terminal value is where 90% of the final value resides in the DCF model, and it is subject to wide swings in values based on tiny changes in assumptions”"

2019-10-21 01:13:24,"Too long. You have all these random, non-sequitur facts but no focus on stuff that will move the share price.

Even as a long-form report - with more general information about the company - it is still way too flabby. Don't say stuff like, paraphrasing: ""retail has low margins"" or ""margins went from x% to y%""...it just isn't interesting.

One thing that might help is to go back through it, and look for the stuff that is really important. What are the real headlines? What caused movement in the financials? Then build a story around that information? Stuff like ""high ROE"" or whatever isn't a thing, no-one cares (because that is already in the price).

You shouldn't have charts breaking up the text (use columns). And your layout for the charts is pretty bad too (backwards X axis, very boring to look at and kind of uninformative).

Finally, this reads like you are young and need more writing experience. A lot of your writing is clumsy which obscures the point of your argument.  Readers, particularly in finance, like clear and predictable writing.

To show you what I mean (I have picked this para at random):

&gt;What I think is one of the metrics that demonstrate that DG is a great business is its phenomenal ROE and other metrics that study the return on shareholder’s capital. Not only is the core business remarkably attractive, but the management has also made reasonable capital allocations decisions and has done so consistently, resulting in a rise of both equity and ROE. The figures for the last 10 years are shown in figure 10.

You could say instead with no loss of meaning:

&gt;DG's consistently high ROE is due to good capital allocation decisions by management (Figure 10).

I don't like this point at all. You shouldn't make this observation without talking directly about the decisions (i.e. which decisions, specifically, were good). But, hopefully, you get the larger point.

I would try writing far shorter summary pieces, and just repeatedly go over them and cut the fat. Doing this will also make clearer to you what information is actually important."
2019-10-21 00:35:38,"There no way of telling what future cash the company will generate will be. Of course this will always play a factor, but other aspects cloud a fundamental outlook. Companies like Fiat Chrysler will likely earn a consistent amount of money for the next decade, however are incredibly discounted relative to a company like IBM that will likely do the same. The market decides what earnings multiplier to assign based on what others are willing to assign it (ie supply and demand). An example would be the difference in P/E multipliers. If every company was only valued based on future earnings, all companies would end up with the same forward P/E ratio. However, that is not even close to true."

2020-04-30 17:36:17,Emerging markets usually lack foreign reserves to stabilize currency in these situations so I would expect to see some national debt crises in emerging markets.  Another consequence is an increase in USD dependence where struggling emerging markets who aren’t already pegged to USD institute a semi floating peg.  If I wanted to make a huge leap I’d say eventually inflation catches up with the USD and causes an even bigger issue down the road where even the world reserve currency has problems holding value.

I don't know what second waves you are talking about because they haven't shut down their economies again. So this second wave you speak of it largely benign. 

Rates are at 0% for the forseeable future, $6 trillion and more is being added to the economy and the country is opening back up. There are plenty of stocks which are still down 50% from their February prices."

2020-04-30 16:45:08,"I'm no expert on Japan, but I do remember the Nikkei trading above 40,000 before they started to collapse rates after the crash of '87. From what I hear they've been treading water ever since - that's why they can't raise rates.

Take into account that, depending on what time-frame you include, a fair historical average for the price of money is around 6%-7%. Remember, the rate also has to be interesting enough for savers, not just borrowers. That's why it's called a damned *interest* rate.

Apart from giving no incentive to save, the main trouble with zero, or near-zero rates (as most large economy CBs have been peddling for more than a decade) is that there's little or no room to stimulate when needed.

Drop a rate from from 0.50% to 0%... meh. Drop it from 7% to 1% if you have to, bam! that's stimulus!

But there's another existential problem with super low rates. The deposit, or risk-free rate is an anchor to value. It offers a safe alternative against which, in theory, all investments should be weighed. Sure, cheap money can create a lot of new enterprise, but it also give births to a lot of duds. If you can finance at 0% and earn a return of half a percent, you look like a genius. Probably explains a lot of the new billionaires.

I believe monetary policy, other than urgent rescue packages, is moot under current circumstances.

Fiscal policy has to be kicked into high gear, in the form Government work programs for infrastructure, like FDR did in the 1930s. Right now the economy needs spending on manufacturing, transport, education, and hospitals, a heck of a lot more than we need to reflate stock valuations -- quickly, quickly, before the next reporting season."

It is far more pleasant to own Visa than it is to own the stuff he owns. Since inception, he has beat the Russel 2000 and russell microcap by 5-7% annualized (AFTER FEES). Over time, I don't think the Russell will underperform the SP500. He is one of the highest alpha managers out there. 

If you don't like the russell exposure, any investor can buy puts on it or just short the russell. They would have (and likely continue to have) a very good return stream."
2020-04-30 16:33:43,"China and Germany had second waves, a lot of other countries have had their population adhere to social distancing better than the US.

Stocks are forward looking, sure. When do you expect earnings and GDP to be at levels of mid last year? Because that's where the market is right now. Personally I don't see that happening until Q1 2021 at the earliest, which would even so, lead to basically a flat market for the rest of the year"

2020-04-30 16:25:08,"What are you talking about that it's not the show stopping virus feared? We had -4.8% GDP in Q1, and that was largely only March effected. Q2 estimates are in the -25% to -40% range. Unemployment right now is north of 20%. We may re-open in late May but it will not be back to peachy right away, and there is still a risk of a double dip into rising infections. The vaccine is still far off. That 6T will obviously help, but PPP ran out of funds in a week, this next round will be gone in another week, how many times is congress going to pass a $300B+ package? My guess is not many more times lol

Again, I'm not saying the SP500 should be at 2200, but it definitely shouldn't be at 2900 either"

I wouldn’t touch the stock, though. I was even leaning short about two years ago. It’s expensive at current valuation (you yourself mentioned it too in your analysis), at least for my investing style.

It leads to a great ride up but a bad one down and we do keep kicking issues down the road, which will eventually need to be dealt with."
2020-04-30 16:06:46,"Great analysis. I always appreciate it when someone takes the time to analyze a company. 

I looked into Dominos a few months ago. From a industry perspective, the fact that consumer’s tastes can change so quickly turned me off. 

Pizza hut, Papa Johns, Dominos  all suffered declines in the past years. Dominos turned it around but i just wasn’t convinced it was a long term phenomenon, especially in the age of uber eats, grub hub, etc. 20 years ago delivery was only pizza and chinese takeout, now its anything you want.

2020-04-30 15:02:47,"VLO stock was up almost 15% after releasing Q1 earnings yesterday (though has given some back today). The near-term operational outlook was bad though better than expected. But the big story was management’s conviction in continuing to pay its current dividend. They mentioned it several times (see below for quotes). The original thesis was that the stock was cheap assuming a dividend cut. If the dividend is sustained, the IRR increases by over 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**We continue to prioritize our investment grade credit rating and non-discretionary uses of capital, including sustaining capital expenditures on our dividend**, and you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses primarily organic growth capital and buybacks.  
\[. . .\]  
We've got this capital allocation framework in place that we've adhered to for years and within that framework, **we consider the use of cash for sustaining CapEx and turnarounds and then the dividends to be non-discretionary**.  
\[. . .\]  
But if you look at additional actions that has been taken, we have a very capable proactive Board of Directors and they declared the dividend last Friday. And they have the same confidence in our business and this team that I have. So the things that we've talked about for years are the things that we've implemented and that we use both when margins are really strong and when margins are weak, like they have been here over the last six or eight weeks, and so **in my view relative to the dividend we've got a long way to go before we need to take any action there**."

But I named MSFT and AMZN and encourage you look at more web service based companies that have a little bit of an economic moat protecting their business... both MSFT and AMZN are big players in scalable content hosting and that seems relatively future proof and immune, maybe even benefitted, by COVID keeping everyone isolated in their homes. Healthcare is another industry (which got beat up a little bit yesterday) which is unlikely to be negative impacted by COVID. People still get sick, they still need medicine, and while a Democratic win in November might be seen as a headwind it’s by no means a reason to avoid the industry altogether. I tend to go for small cap development stage names but I see some promise in bigger players like GILD and BMY though I would wait for GILD to come down a little after this remdesivir run up... I’m not particularly convinced by the results I’ve seen so far or by the fact that they substantially changed the trial design half way through, ordinarily that would kill any FDA application but these are desperate times. 

Banks are also just a safe bet on a longer time horizon, everyone knows they’re all fucked in the near term but there is some serious value to be had looking at price to book ratios. When interest rates do inevitably one day maybe in the future possibly go up you’ll be happy to own those (of course some have speculated we’ll be at full stimulus for decades to come and amazingly the rationale is not unreasonable which is scary). 

Then you’ve got dividend plays like some of these mortgage REITs or $T (ATT) which is yielding 7%. Is that dividend safe? For ATT I would say “yes” and for REITs it depends on the nature of he underlying property but yeah, the housing market seems to be relatively protected this time around though we will undoubtedly see some defaults by the time summer is over. Probably some opportunity there. 

Of course the best approach is to invest in things you’re familiar with. Think you’ll still be using apple devices in 5-10 years? It’s a great core position to hold with good growth and modest yield. Think you’ll be driving a Tesla? Buy Tesla! Musk’s idiocy be damned! Think you’ll be shopping at the mall at Macy’s? When’s the last time you did that? Probably want to avoid. I’m certainly not about to get on a plane or cruise ship anytime soon if it can be helped and I don’t think I’ve been to a movie theatre in well over two years. When you invest in companies you’re familiar with in your every day life, it’s much easier to stay on top of your due diligence and understand how extraneous events can impact the business on a fundamental level. That’s what retail investing is all about. The only client you have to worry about is yourself!

Here’s the open data:

Notice cases and hospital reduce use continues to trend steadily upwards. In the moronic tweet you reference, Musk suggests that because the early estimates were so much worse than the current reality, we should open back up the economy. In fact, the data conclusively shows CA is likely months away from considering reopening under the very optimistic federal guidelines put forward by the Trump administration that needs to see a decrease in cases over a given time period, something we haven’t seen on any timeframe. 

See how this works? Any by the way, while California, through extreme but necessary measures, has managed to flatten the predicted curve significantly, the IHME model continues to be slowly updated to its original prognostication that over 100k Americans will he dead by August. Last week they were predicting 60k by August 4. We’re currently at 62,300 deaths and it’s not even May, the model was updated 3 days ago to reflect a new expected death count of 72,433. We’ll likely be there by May 5 or 6.

You're confusing long term deflation with a temporary price shock. And yes at the beginning, if people believe prices will rise again in the long term it will likely spur consumption.

The more deflation persists though, the more people stop having expectations that inflation will return. Nobody in Japan believes house prices will rise much these days, because they're still below their heights from 30 years ago.

If you believe asset prices will continue to fall, which serious deflation will do, then you wont buy that house, because you'll run the risk of being in negative equity."

Additionally, we did not see a massive ETF sell-off yet IMO and this will happen as the 20+ million unemployed in the U.S + millions in other countries start taping on their savings in the next months to make ends meet

In the long run, the risk (bigger than covid) is that we see increasing refinancings of businesses that should not be refinanced according to their fundamentals (zombies) since 2008 as the Fed has kept interest rates low for a long time. This also happens in the EU with government debt as yields are hitting all-time lows again despite rising debt levels.

There are some drawbacks to this though. Firstly, if you find that you've overinflated the economy, it's much more difficult than to pull that money back out again than if you'd just purchased government bonds. Second, you can't guarantee that the public will spend that money. In fact, if the economy is very weak and consumer confidence low, and the public think the government cheques will just be a one-off and not repeated, much of it will end up sitting in bank accounts for a rainy day, rather than spent which is what the economy needs (but might not be optimal for any one family)."
2020-04-30 13:51:17,"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm updated every Thursday afternoon. 



I think basket funds like that are a loser in this environment, you want to be more granular in your stock selection right now as there are obvious winners and losers in this pandemic recession— index and etf investing is going to take a back seat for a little while which we’re even seeing right now with all the cyclical trade (yesterday is a perfect example, big caps all flat or down while the most hated industries led the rally... oil and cruise lines and such). If you’re on reddit you’re too young to own any bonds, particularly with yields as historically low as they are... with where the 10 year is you’ll probably make more money in 5-10 years by buying a house and paying the carrying costs at 3% mortgage interest rather than holding t-bills. Bonds are just uninvestable right now unless you’ve just got way too much money and don’t know where to put it. Even guys like Gundlach are lightening the load in light of what’s happening right now. That’s pretty unusual. 

Cash is king right now and contrary to what our /r/wsb OP here likes to think, most fund managers are sitting on appreciable dry powder and waiting for the next leg down. Sure, the FOMO from this bull rally has undoubtedly caused some of that to make its way into names like MSFT and AMZN which are both back at or near all time highs or into some of the cyclical industries I mentioned which were hard to ignore on a valuation basis but the general consensus among *smart money* is that we’ve only seen the beginning of the economic impact of this virus and that things are going to get a lot worse and this recession is going to last longer than most people think (many analysts think we’ll see a recovery in q4 which is pretty hard to imagine as someone modeling the progression of deaths from the virus in this country in additional to my own anecdotal sense that a large swath of consumers are not going to be so quick to return to their usual spending habits even after a safe and effective vaccine has been widely distributed which will likely take substantially longer than 2 years). 

At the same time, on a longer timeframe, 20% drops from the high have always been been historical buying opportunities. What I have been telling family members is that this is the time to start picking at positions in stocks they can imagine holding for a minimum of 10 years. I encourage them to buy 10 shares at a time (unless they like something like AMZN, sheesh, I don’t know why anyone would want to trade shares over calls at its current price) since there are no commissions anymore so they can cost average over time. 

I think you want to be a cautious buyer in this market and not chase equities up. It’s very rare to bottom with as much positive sentiment as we saw at the depths of the recent crash, people were buying the dip with confidence. In my experience (I’ve only participated as far back as the dot com bust in ‘99, full disclosure) that a much more complex and protracted bear market rather than the v-shape recover everyone has been hoping for and what one would expect from an ordinary illness-related economic event. At this point the divergence between markets and economic data has made it clear that a real v-shape recovery of the economy is most certainly not in the cards so I, like most other professional portfolio managers, am highly skeptical of this rally. 

I think a 20-30% cash allocation is not unwarranted if you don’t have to worry about current holdings / unrealized gains or losses. I’ve been selling into this rally, it never hurts to take a profit."

2020-04-30 13:29:06,"Well depends - definitely can go higher no doubt because of this so it is something for a bullish case.

If real estate prices come down, which have been artificially frozen with transactions falling, I could see a lot of money moving into that asset class over stocks. The real estate market is very, very interesting to me right now. Some houses are still selling but what about commercial with retail and office... There is plenty of leverage in this market so it might be the opportunity money flows into. 

There is also plenty of systematic risk by taking on more debt, even if cheap. Take AMC - they explored bankruptcy but have backed off of it. That's not a high margin business and one that doesn't necessarily come back quickly. Maybe even people decide that they want to watch Netflix and there is a fundamental change.

Check out the equal weighted returns of the S&amp;P 500, retail sector, etc. We all know what has led this rally - large cap tech, FAANG, etc. These earnings are coming out now and look pretty good. Microsoft and Netflix obviously are great in this environment but even things like Facebook and Google's results showed this and provided hope for the market because ads are supposed to lag in recessions but ads are cheap and they have more users on right now, which gives a tailwind in tough times. These tailwinds aren't around for some companies that are riding on expectations on a return to normalcy and normal business activity sooner rather than later. 

For me - Yesterday, with Remdesivir was the first time you really saw and felt like the laggards were truly leading the rally. You're right that it seems to be enough... but what if it doesn't give confidence to the consumers. We see in China data that people aren't going out as much. This with zombie companies - like AMC - could lead to lots of risk. We will see that revert - and we are with small caps today. Until we see a continual recovery in those true laggards, there is risk, even with money on the sidelines, that we will slide significantly lower.

I'm not a market timer so I won't guess in the next 2 weeks/months what the market will do. I have a very hard time trying to figure what the mentality of people are. So I'm picking my spots to invest in some things. Maybe you're right and we rip higher but I think we are in a weird spot and it will take very little to spook the market not to the March lows but possibly quite a bit lower. Just like it took very little to euphorically rise us to this point. 

Though I do agree multiples deserve to be higher in this macro event so if we magically had 100% immunity tomorrow we would see levels go above the February highs."

Significantly increased money supply and lower economic productivity -&gt; high inflation

Low interest rates and high valuations / prices -&gt; low returns

Inflation &gt; financial returns and economic productivity = negative real returns and economic stagflation

The last stagflation event we had resulted in an extreme low valuation down cycle. Now keep in mind that this is just one scenario. What other scenarios exist in a low productivity and low interest rate environment?"
2020-04-30 13:26:08,"&gt; If central bank printing was enough to overcome fundamental problems with a country's economy, why is Zimbabwe a meme?

2020-04-30 13:24:11,"&gt; What stocks are you holding for long term that are at reasonable prices now and wont be affected by 30 mil unemployment?

Spirit Aerosystems (SPR): Critical parts supplier to Boeing. Stock is down from 70 to 20. Boeing isn't going to fail and people are not going to stop flying. The 737 Max will get approved to fly again in a few months.

OMAB - Mexican airport listed in the USA as an ADR. Down 60%. Again, people are not going to stop flying. This is an airport, not an airline. They have ZERO net debt.

Restoration Hardware (RH) - Was at 250 in Feb now at 150. Plenty of people sitting at home right now who want to redecorate their homes. Have an ecommerce business which is firing on all cylinders during lockdowns. 

Ventas (VTR) - best in class management team in healthcare focused REIT. Was at 60 in Feb now available at 30.

2020-04-30 13:23:03,"&gt;Some will want to debate the minutiae of the science but the drug is better than nothing and is a big lift to sentiment.

It's not lifting sentiment. It's adding hopium. 

&gt;Economic data appears to have bottomed in mid-April. 

Uh. We added 3.8M more unemployed today. GDP report yesterday was almost 5% contraction and the next report is widely expected to be calamitous. 

&gt;There has not been a major credit event and the Fed has backstopped the bond market successfully so far. It's anyone's guess but I don't see a systemic blow up.

There wasn't a credit event in the GFC... until there was. The Fed tried to unwind their balance sheet for a hot minute and the repo markets freaked the fuck out back in September. 

Excess liqudity has only forestalled the problem. The market is trading with frankly pitiful volume. There's a huge amount of participation that's waiting on the sidelines looking to pounce. 

&gt; Yesterday Powell basically told us he was not going to taper monetary stimulus for a long time. They're going to print for years.

If central bank printing was enough to overcome fundamental problems with a country's economy, why is Zimbabwe a meme? 

&gt;Most stocks I see missing earnings and pulling guidance don't react, indicating the market is willing to look through bad results.

Is that what it means? Or does that imply the market is no longer trading on fundamentals and is instead taking outsized risk based entirely on the premise that the Fed will be enough to keep everything pushing higher. 

Declaring that the market is ""past it"" when we haven't even seen the effects of the economic shut down is just myopic. 

You think 30M people can get laid off and that have NO impact on the market? PEs are so high, it's a wonder Jeff Bezos doesn't walk around with a permanent nose bleed. 

And none of this takes into account the fact that *every other country in the world is just as fucked*. Even if the Fed could just print the economy past the crisis, it can't do that for the rest of the world. 

And none of this has anything to do with the state of the virus today. This is all stuff that has already happened and cannot unhappen. 

Imagine if states ease lockdown restrictions and the virus immediately rebounds - like we just saw in Germany.

I disagree with that assumption, so I'm bearish. I don't see ~35 million unemployed Americans getting rehired as soon as everything reopens. I don't see everyone going back to the movies and taking international flights, buying things from retail stores, etc. as much as they did pre-Covid. That's just me. Now that people are learning to live below their means, and generally have less cash due to the crisis, I don't see consumer sentiment skyrocketing back to the 130 level anytime soon.

To me, this is less about the death counts and infection rates and more about the underlying affect is has on consumer sentiment, spending, and economic data.

OP, I suggest you pay closer attention to the Fed balance sheet rather than taking Powell at his word. The fed has been jawboning since early March but they’ve substantially pulled back in repo operations and bought exactly $0 worth of the junk debt and ABS they said they would.

They’re hoping barking will be enough to elevate markets in the face of unprecedented economic contraction. That only works until it doesn’t. I deal a lot with small cap biotech and I’m pretty familiar with the FDA approval process.... in any other circumstances, Remdesivir would be sunk by the fact that they completely changed the primary endpoint half way through the trial from looking at patients on an 8 point scale to looking at recovery time which seems to me a confident way to disinclude negative outcome. Based on Fauci’s comments, it’s easy to imagine that they didn’t see statistically significant benefit but it was close and there were no safety concerns so what does anyone have to lose? Quell the public panic and give the president something to be happy about which keeps Fauci in charge.

If you figure we get 2% inflation, cash is a -2% investment. Bonds will be say -1.25% or something, and then stocks if you assume they will be flat or higher then sure, but if stocks have even a slight down year, they won't be the best asset class anymore. Plus, once they lose their perceived best asset class status, people will sell even more.

You can't just assume stocks will go up in the short term. Sure in the long run like 10+ years yeah I agree, buying now is fine. But why would I buy something at 25 P/E which has downside risk? That P/E means at their current earnings rate it would take me 25 years to recoop my investment. What if earnings don't just pop right back to what they were?

Since when has the market just been completely ignoring things 1 year out and sooner? This market is divorced from the reality of this crisis. Yes, we will have a sharp bounce back in Q3 and Q4, but that doesn't mean we will even be back to even in GDP or unemployment or earnings by year end, yet here the market was yesterday, higher than before the 2018 spill.

2022-05-17 20:34:32,"The idea of an auction process is to ensure a buyer can't swoop in and get the company cheaper than its really worth. But a dutch auction doesn't work for that.  A dutch auction is typically done for buying some shares from shareholders willing to sell. You need an auction where the company as a whole is sold and all the shareholders are forced to sell, otherwise the sale has less value to the buyer if they have to manage owning a still public company with outside shareholders owning a significant part of the equity.

The typical reason a company is trading at a big discount to IV is that the daily (mostly retail)  buyers don't reflect full possible demand. Other companies interested in buying the target aren't buying shares in the daily market because they'll have to disclose well before they can reach controlling share position. They want to own the company outright, not a tiny piece. .  

So if you want to maximize value, the board needs to talk to potential buyers directly, typically by using an investment bank to approach all possible buyers which is starting an auction like process for the company as a whole."

2022-05-15 23:30:18,"**The Men Who Flipped on Bill Hwang Were Trusted Lieutenants**

* Executives who spent careers with Hwang turned on their boss
* William Tomita, Scott Becker could become star witnesses

Not long ago he was playing polo on the Connecticut Gold Coast -- a dashing young Wall Streeter charging hard for a winning shot.  
But on April 22, with his nerves on edge, William Tomita reached for the Xanax: He was due in federal court that Friday to plead guilty in the Archegos trading debacle and to formally turn on his longtime boss, Bill Hwang. Tomita was so distressed to speak publicly, he would tell the judge, that he had to take anti-anxiety medication first.  
Before him to the Manhattan courthouse had come his colleague Scott Becker, down from his home in Goshen, a quiet New York town named after the biblical land of plenty. Becker, too, had arrived to plead guilty and officially flip on Hwang, the enigmatic investor accused of masterminding a vast, criminal scheme to mislead banks and manipulate markets.  
Until that moment, Tomita and Becker were virtually unknown in financial circles, at least beyond the insular domain of Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. Now they will play a key role in prosecutors’ case against Hwang and Patrick Halligan, the former chief financial officer of the secretive investment firm. The once-trusted lieutenants could become star witnesses.

Few have been closer professionally to Hwang for longer than Tomita, his top trader, and Becker, his risk manager. With those two at his side, Hwang amassed one of the world’s great fortunes in virtual secrecy, only to lose it in a public spectacle of recklessness, hubris and, prosecutors assert, fraud and more. Tomita and Becker have cut deals in hopes of avoiding prison, or at least shortening their terms. Hwang and Halligan have pleaded not guilty to a range of charges, including racketeering conspiracy brought under statutes typically associated with mob bosses.  
Who are the Archegos insiders who’ve turned on Bill Hwang? Like their boss, Tomita and Becker have flown under the radar for years. Both 38, they’ve spent almost all of their careers working with Hwang, first at Tiger Asia Management, where Hwang initially ran into trouble, and later at Archegos, whose collapse last year sent shock waves through global finance.  
Despite playing key roles at Archegos -- which at one point amassed a staggering $160 billion position in stocks, according to prosecutors -- their public resumes are practically nonexistent. Neither appear to have active LinkedIn accounts. A Google search turns up almost nothing before Archegos imploded and made headlines around the world. Their lawyers didn’t return calls and emails seeking comment.  
The prospect of a courtroom drama replete with accusations and betrayals is bound to captivate Wall Street. The prosecution is depending on the pair to provide an inside account of supposed lies and deception. The defense will almost certainly question why Tomita and Becker have turned on their former boss. Hwang and Halligan are due back in court May 19.  
Jackson R. Sharman III, a white-collar defense lawyer, said one defense strategy would be to argue that the two cooperating witnesses are merely trying to cover up their own mistakes or wrongdoing, and that while Hwang may have lost a fortune, he didn’t intend to commit any crimes. The likely argument, according to Sharman: “There’s no smoking gun, there’s no fingerprint.”

What’s more, the Archegos debacle fractured ties between Hwang and some of his former staffers, who have fought to recoup deferred compensation that was tied up with the firm, Bloomberg has reported. Many Archegos employees were required to invest 25% or more of their bonuses with the fund and collectively lost millions of dollars, according to the US. Becker and Tomita elected to have a “substantial” portion of their money deferred, the SEC said.  
But the duo’s testimony will be crucial for prosecutors to obtain a conviction against Hwang because evidence in the indictment of his knowingly and intentionally violating the law “is exceedingly thin,” said Justin Danilewitz, a partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein &amp; Lehr and former assistant US Attorney. Without detailed independent corroboration, “the government’s job is tougher here.”  
Tomita and Becker certainly have a lot to tell. Both spent almost a decade and a half working for Hwang. Tomita, the son of a prominent Chicago surgeon, graduated from Northwestern University in 2006 with a degree in economics and international studies. After a brief stint at Lehman Brothers before the investment bank’s 2008 collapse, he went to work for Hwang’s hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management. A few years later, the firm pleaded guilty to wire fraud related to illegal trading in Chinese stocks and shut down.  
While Tomita wasn’t named by US authorities, Hong Kong regulators charged him with helping Hwang commit insider trading. He was cleared in 2013, with regulators saying he was just a junior staff member acting on Hwang’s instructions.  
Despite the close call, that year, Tomita stayed with his boss as he opened his family office, Archegos.  
There, prosecutors contend, Hwang called the shots and relied on Tomita to execute trades. Tomita also was one of Hwang’s primary contacts when communicating with about a dozen counterparties, according to the government.  
When not trading for Archegos, Tomita often played the No. 2 position on polo fields including one in Greenwich, Connecticut. With a half-point handicap, on a scale of -2 to 10, his typical job involved setting up goals for the No. 1 player and taking his own shot after a missed try.   
One player who practiced with Tomita said he came across as polite and deferential -- almost unusually so in a sport known for aggressive and even dangerous play. Tomita avoided big risks on the field, said this person, speaking on the condition of anonymity. After Tomita filled in for this player in one game, the trader followed up with a personal Thank You note.   
Tomita has also been seen on the polo fields near Palm Beach, Florida, where he has a white mid-century house hidden behind tall hedges that’s a block from the ocean. No one answered the door there this week.   
Tomita has pleaded guilty to five counts, including conspiracy, fraud and market manipulation, according to court records. Each crime carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. Tomita is free on $500,000 bond.  
At the April hearing in front of Judge Laura Taylor Swain, Tomita admitted under oath that, as head trader from March 2020 to March 2021, he made trades intended to build market power in particular stocks and used financial derivatives to mask the size of Archegos’s positions from other traders and from counterparties.  
He also made false statements to banks and brokers that allowed Archegos to trade on margin and convince them to enter into swap agreements with the firm.  
“I agreed with Bill and others to carry out the business of Archegos through a pattern of manipulating the prices of securities and deceiving counterparties,” Tomita said, standing and reading from a prepared statement.  
The day before, Becker had pleaded guilty to three criminal counts of conspiracy and fraud. Becker, who graduated summa cum laude from Manhattan College with a degree in accounting and finance, told Swain that he started on Hwang’s operations team at Tiger Asia in 2007. He told the judge that he lied to other financial institutions about Archegos’s holdings as part of a scheme to get them to extend credit or take part in swap transactions.  
“For example, in 2021, I falsely represented to certain financial institutions that Archegos’s largest position was approximately 35% of its net asset value when, in fact, I knew the largest position had grown to significantly higher -- to a significantly higher percentage than that,” Becker told the judge.   
“And when you did these things, did you know that what you were doing was wrong and illegal?” Swain asked Becker.  
“Yes,” he replied. Becker is free on $300,000 bond.  
While Tomita cut a striking figure on various polo grounds, Becker appears to have lived a quieter life in Goshen, a 75-minute drive north of Manhattan. His tan two-story colonial-style home, with warm red shutters, sits on a large, grassy hill speckled with spring dandelions. Reached there after his hearing, he declined to talk about his background, Archegos or the case against Hwang and Halligan.  
“I have a young family,” Becker said, looking over his shoulder into the house. “Please don’t come back.”"

I listened to this interview a couple of days ago, but I recall Powell stating (well paraphrasing what he said) that in hindsight there is value to the claim that they should have started sooner.  But that they only work with the data as they get it, and the data at the time showed they were doing what they needed to do.

It was a YES! moment for me seeing him admit that.  But on the other hand, it didn't give me warm fuzzies.  That considering the same approach he, and the committee, are taking to getting us out of this mess is the same approach that got us in this mess in the first place.

2022-05-15 10:06:39,"&gt;wages would still be moving up at healthy levels. They wouldn’t have to go down, but ultimately they would be at levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation.

How I understand that is wages aren't going back to precovid wages.  Rather from here on out the increases would be consistent with 2% inflation.  

So there really isn't any getting the eggs out of the cake with what happened in the past 2 years.  That cake is baked.  And I think the effects of this will take years to even out.  

There are going to be many more people still looking at their salary (who didn't already get a large inflationary raise), looking at what other people are getting for similar work, and either asking for a raise to get pay in line or jumping to competitors that already pay more.  Which will then cause more employers to raise product prices to accommodate the salary increases.  Or cut corners on product quality.  Or both.  It's messy.

It also makes me wonder if we don't end up with a multi-year period of wage stagnation as companies try to absorb higher costs.  And seeing how far they can get away with it.  It is such a complex matter due to all sides being squeezed financially."

2022-05-15 00:36:41,"Arguably yes. Given that we had already been at the tail-end of the credit cycle in 2008, and considering the additional stimulus from the past decade of ""Not QE"", US markets and the real economy had already become fragile relative to previous cycles - even before covid hit us. The reason why policymakers came out with such force in terms of monetary policy in 2008 was because we were truly staring into the abyss of another Great Depression *a la* 1929 - and we managed to kick the can down the road for another decade before the 2020's pandemic began. 

When 2020 started, we were staring into that same abyss once again *with even worse odds* \- greater leverage, lower growth, lower interest rates and a synchronous global recession. Basically the global economy was standing at the ""Whatever It Takes"" precipice - as evidenced by the justification to finally pull the 'helicopter money' taboo card. A Global Great Depression that dragged on for another 10 years (and possibly more) would have been far, far worse than whatever we could possibly face in the present day, and going forward - it could spiral into an actual Great Power war *a la* WW3. 

Given that choice, it was pretty obvious what the only remaining path was - kick the can down the road again, and figure things out later. There wasn't an easy answer (and there still isn't) *-* at this point, it's all about tradeoffs and optimizing ROI. Even the top of the food chain remains hostage to the whims of Mother Nature."
2022-05-15 00:22:55,"While I pride myself in understanding valuation and having a reasonable attitude and temperament towards investing, can someone who better understands macroeconomics and stimulus tell me whether or not this should have been done far, far earlier?

The insane run-up we saw in stocks... the stimulus happening for as long as it did... was it absolutely necessary to alleviate any credit crunch or whatever we experienced this time around? I call back to the 2008 recession where every talking head in business said if they didn't do what they did, the economy truly would have collapsed. Has every action to this point been as important?

I disagree with some of the actions taken during COVID but the Fed actions behind the scenes that are rarely discussed... was this all vital to keep our economy going, despite the insane inflation it caused especially recently?"
2022-05-14 22:36:12,"\&gt; So a soft landing is, is really just getting back to 2% inflation while keeping the labor market strong. And it’s quite challenging to accomplish that right now, for a couple of reasons. One is just that unemployment is very, very low, the labor market’s extremely tight, and inflation is very high. So it will be challenging, it won’t be easy. No one here thinks that it will be easy. Nonetheless, we think there are pathways, as you mentioned, for us to get there. And really what that means is just as we raise rates, we — so the problem, what causes inflation, is that demand and supply are out of whack. There’s too much demand. For example, in the labor market, there’s more demand for workers than there are people to take the jobs, right now, by a substantial margin. And, because of that, wages are moving up at levels that are unsustainably high and not consistent with low inflation. And so what we need to do is we need to get demand down, give supply a chance to recover and get those to align. So how might we do that? Right now, in the labor market, there are two job openings for every unemployed person. It’s historically high-level. So in principle, and I’m not saying this will be easy to do, in principle, you could moderate demand, reduce demand to the point where job openings move down substantially, and the labor market gets much closer to being in balance. And that would affect … wages would still be moving up at healthy levels. They wouldn’t have to go down, but ultimately they would be at levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation."

Even if the stock falls post deal to $2 you still double your money as the sponsor. What do you care then about the quality of the target company? You just want to get any deal done.

Too often I see in fund letters talk of how they like the stock because of returns/growth/mgmt and think it's cheap because it's at a low multiple or whatever, but it can't just be that the market is offering a company with no fundamental issues at a discount for no reason, right? There must be something you believe that the consensus doesn't, and that's the only source of alpha I feel. Let me use two examples:

(1) Meta/FB: there is disagreement over whether Meta's heavy investments into the Metaverse for the next 3 years will pay off. That could be an opportunity for alpha if you in fact believe it could yield great returns because the street is currently undecided or doubtful. That's why FB is cheap.

(2) Google: I don't really see any divergence in views on the street on Google's fundamentals medium or long-term. Maybe some difference on 2022/3 numbers bc of recession or whatnot, but nobody is really disagreeing on Google's fundamentals (moat, returns, margins, growth, etc). So even if Google's multiple has contracted from 30x to 22x or whatever, why is that necessarily ""cheap"" or an opportunity? 

I don't know, maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way, but I feel the market is pretty efficient in valuing a business where there isn't much divergence in views on its fundamentals. Where the market price may be inefficient is when the range of fundamental outcomes is sufficiently wide, no?"

2021-11-16 10:01:01,"What the author is describing sound like an industry already at capacity, and then going over.  In the case of lumber I never saw any shortages, just a huge jump in prices.  Nor do I believe the lumber industry is facing shortages or working at capacity.  I could be wrong.  
That jump in prices came down just as quickly because most people weren't will to pay it, and waited instead.  I don't believe there were massive build ups in the system that will take time to clear.
So in one case we've got an increase in demand + increase in price, which fixed the demand, at which point prices returned to a similar level.  In this case we appear to have an increase/same level of demand resulting in a massive backlog, and increases in prices, hopefully leading to a corresponding correction in demand.  

However, the question for me is how much of the demand in shipping is inelastic?"

2021-11-15 22:38:23,"It was very similar in lumber earlier this year, prices mooned, and sawmills didn't jump to make significant efforts to increase capacity because they understood (being much closer to the moving parts in the system than we are as observers) that any long term investments made today wouldn't come online quickly enough to reap the rewards of spring '21 pricing.


We've known about supply chain issues for many months now (basically all of 2021 Odd Lots podcast episodes have been focused on the topic), while consumers might be surprised, if you're ordering parts/goods in size you've been over-ordering for months now and there will eventually be a buildup in domestic inventories that frees up space in the channel.


The implication that supply chain issues will continue for years assumes that domestic consumption will find a higher resting point than pre-pandemic and/or total shipping capacity is lower for longer. It also assumes that there is no political will to intervene, which could undermine the ""perverse"" incentives which are driving the global shipping magnates to constrain capacity."
2021-11-15 20:11:03,"For capacity bottlenecks, more incentive can sometimes make it worse.  If you have 100 people trying to cram through a doorway, it's not going to get better by making it 1000 people, throwing a bunch of hundred dollar bills on the ground on the other side or setting the place on fire.  There are physical constraints involved and everyone shoving for the door slows the throughout overall.  Motivation is not always the problem.  The solution to that problem by the way is actually to place a pole or barrier in the way to slow the pace down to something more orderly.

It may be the case that the reactions to the shortage are actually making things worse.  If company X buys up all the shipping containers it can find so it can ship cargo during a shortage, that actually reduces the utilization of those containers since they will sit until needed.

I'm not saying that things will go on like this forever, but complex systems like this can go sideways even with rational players in the middle and lots of motivation."

Their reduced cash flow conversions for 2021 are a result of a FY2020 where the company operated on unsustainably low working capital caused by supply-chain issues.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think that causes some near/medium-term issues, but we'll see how much. There's already a ton of automation that was coming for those jobs before any wage bumps, and if those costs go up substantially that focus will be redoubled.

Inflation might be a general problem, but it can be very specific in some cases, like this one where they've already got one problem (back ups) and need to hire to fix it in a way that a place that's just lost a couple of workers and can pick up the slack cannot.

I agree there's automation coming for these jobs, automated trucks make more sense than automated cars, I'd think the same thing for crane operators at a port, but the question is which is cheaper.  I'm guessing it's been the human for a long time, but I don't know where the line/cut-off would be."
2021-11-15 14:59:35,"&gt;if the amount of stuff being shipped at the end of the day is decreased then someone somewhere in the supply chain is losing out.

The consumer and retailer is losing out.  That is why you see pictures of empty shelves in some stores and one of the reasons you are starting to see prices increase across the board."
2021-11-15 14:57:58,"If you operate at (example numbers) 90% capacity typically, and stop operating for 6 months, and then start up again, operating at 100% capacity, how long will it take to move through the backlog? 54 months. After covid itself stopped impacting port etc. operations (over a year ago!) and they started working again, well... They didn't work at 100% capacity. Nor 90%. Just 5-10%. The backlog is absolutely immense.

Building more chassis requires you to move steel to factories, which is very slow and expensive, because warehouses and transportation links are backed up and steel is at $2000/ton, so they can produce them. There should be no reason to have or need a single chassis per container anyway, but...

* they can't load goods in warehouses, because they can't get empty containers to the warehouses

* they can't unload container ships, because the docks are full

* they can't move containers from the docks, because their are no empty chassis

* there are no empty chassis because they are being used to hold empty containers they can't store on the ground

* they can't bring those empty containers to warehouses, because it's more profitable

A lot of these are caused by stupid processes (and regulations), because the market is not magical (but yes, also not fully liberal) and doesn't actually solve problems with more money, due to perverse incentives. Expanding the buffer size by stacking containers more high frees up a lot of chassis, and lets you unload ships. (Previously, 2-3 ships waiting at the port of long beach was high, nowadays you have 50+ (actually: https://www.businessinsider.com/supply-chain-crisis-record-number-of-container-ships-ca-ports-2021-11 ). Overall throughput across the seas is thus much lower than before.) They only started operating these ports 24 hours a day recently. Many stupid regulations. But not only.

This is why stocks like ZIM have a p/e of 1 and are making hand over fist. This is why steel has skyrocketed etc. etc. etc. /r/vitards has been profiting off of supply chain stocks for most of the year and seen the port waiting numbers go from 10, to 20, to...

-----

You talk about investment, but capital expenditure isn't always a good business idea. If suddenly everyone lay out billions to increase throughput, they will go through the backlog quickly and suddenly have way more capacity than necessary. This is the business cycle, causing booms and busts. For this reason, commodity and logistics companies haven't made investments in years - they were still burned from 2008. Even the number of container ships is much less before, as they decommission them without replacements, because newer ones didn't seem financially sensible (the market punishes unused capacity). And now, well... It takes a long time to build a large ship."

Yes, and yes it's true that some of it doom and gloom.  OTOH, I've also noticed a tendency amongst managers to always dismiss the reports from the people actually doing the work.  I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle.

&gt;  For ex, do you really think if US ports are clogged and port operators are just bumping up storage fees to be profitable the govt isn't going to step in? Do you think port operators don't know this?

They have been pretty quiet about a lot of the bumps in life saving drugs.  The truth is that they've turned a blind eye to a lot of rent seeking behavior, unless it gets a lot of national attention.  If the port operators continue to fly under the radar like they have so far, then yes, I expect it to continue.  If the news outlets get ahold of it, then there might be some push back, but this is a temporary issue in a way that jacking up the price of insulin 3x permanently is not.  Assuming they do step in, it's likely to be long after the issue has been resolved in the next year or two."

Things are messy as hell in the short-term, and frankly it'll probably take longer than my expectation to fully fix because this stuff always does.

However, what he's postulating as a long-term scenario would have a ridiculous amount of public resources directed toward it to fix. 

It'll be interesting to see what happens with shipping. Seems like we're setting up perfectly for normal boom/bust cycle in the industry. Baltic Dry Index is still ridiculously high, but has fallen nearly 50% from its high a month ago which is...hilariously absurd."
2021-11-15 14:29:13,"&gt; He's getting the incentives all wrong which is the problem with his analysis. Short-term there will be profit seeking, but this is 100% not going to be the new normal, and you'd have to be a fucking moron to think that's true.

Right, which goes to his point that there is no incentive to change.  I agree with you that he's probably not correct about 3x shipping, or that this is a new normal, but if things are as bad as he makes them out to be, and the system had that little elasticity, then it makes sense that we're looking at months or years to straighten out the system.  So to me this becomes a question of how long will it take for things go back to a state of equilibrium, and what that new normal will be.

Further that the areas where it needs help, more people, appear to already be under strain, so that it's going to be difficult to fix.  Which goes back to the issue with it taking a while to settle back.

Finally, while it might not be triple shipping, I'm expecting some rise in shipping, and maybe few companies offering free/subsidized shipping like Amazon does now."

2021-11-15 12:37:29,"Agree... the argument the author presents is there are basically two ways the ""boss"" can respond:

1.  Take advantage of the situation and start increasing revenue without making any extra investment (increase profit margin with no risk or cost).

2.  Invest in infrastructure and higher wages, meaning you may see topline growth as you increase throughput but you also have increased cost.  You also run the risk of shipping demand going down or normalizing as the situation resolves meaning you are stuck with higher wages/extra infrastructure with nothing to show for it."
2021-11-15 12:36:31,"I'm a little surprised by some of the cynicism in this thread. While a lot of the evidence put forward is anecdotal, I thought a couple of key points came across that aren't discussed that frequently in the financial press:

1. Trucking presents a huge freight bottleneck.
2. There is little incentive for truck drivers to transport goods to/from ports.
3. There is less of an incentive for port operators to move cargo than one might think, given that they can increase charges for storage.

These, taken in conjunction, provide a degree of support for an argument that supply chains are going to remain tight for quite some time. This conflicts with a lot of the narrative spun by analysts and/or journalists, who seem to be positing that supply chain tightness should alleviate in the short-run."
2021-11-15 11:48:35,"Can't really say without knowing the future. It does seem like the supply chain has been on a 40 year pursuit to zero inventory/just in time paradigm a reality. I would think there might be fear of building in even the slightest bit of over capacity.

If there's 1 crane per 50-100 trucks at every port union and non-union as this author claims, shouldn't the ports that manage to work around this limitation (or get more cranes) do the best?  Shouldn't the private contractors working at premium manage to resolve this pretty quickly (with less margin for vendors higher up the supply chain)?

Like to put it in a simpler question, to a logistical ignoramus like me this seems like a straightforward problem you can just throw money at (leading to higher near term prices across the board up and down the supply chain for sure) and it'll resolve in the near term (6 months to a year).

2021-11-15 10:27:22,"&gt; But it doesn’t hurt the owners of the transportation business — in fact the laws of supply and demand mean that they are actually going to make more money through higher rates, without changing a thing. They don’t have to improve or add infrastructure (because it’s costly), and they don’t have to pay their workers more (warehouse workers, crane operators, truckers).

??? And wouldn't they make even more over the long run if they did add infrastructure?"

Of course there is incentive for companies to clear up the supply issues, so they can ship even more.

Definitely going to take time to work through it, but the notion that the existing problems are here to stay is laughable.

This whole ""shortage of truck drivers is never going to get better and will never be solved"" sounds like what you hear around peaks of certain phenomenon."
2021-11-15 06:48:25,"&gt;People who want their deliveries in a reasonable time are going to have to start paying premium rates. There will be levels of priority, and each increase in rate premium essentially jumps that freight ahead of all the freight with lower or no premium rates. Unless the lack of shipping infrastructure is resolved, things will back up in a cascading effect to the point where if your products are going general freight, you might wait a month or two for delivery. It’s already starting. If you use truck shipping in any way, you’ve no doubt started to see the delays. Think about what’s going to happen to holiday season shipping.  
&gt;  
&gt;What we have is a system with a limited amount of trucks and qualified drivers, many of whom are already working 14 hours a day (legally, the maximum they can), and now the supposed fix is to have them work 24 hours a day, every day, and not stop until the backlog is cleared. It’s not going to happen. It is not physically possible. There is no “cavalry” coming. No trucking companies are going to pay to register their trucks to haul containers for something that is supposedly so “short term,” because these same companies can get higher rate loads outside the ports. There is no extra capacity to be had, and it makes NO difference anyway, because If you can’t get a container unloaded at a warehouse, having drivers work 24/7/365 solves nothing.

I watched a video recently of Steve Eisman (from October 2019) talking about Zillow and Tesla and he said there's no point shorting anymore anyways because if it's at 2, it first goes to 6, then 0. He's right. It's just not right. But who cares what I say and what's right, retail and altos after will rush in and maintain the pump as long as they can."

AR is where the metaverse is going to be at its most convincing imo, or maybe I just lack imagination. I'd expect the first AR glasses from Apple to be worried to the phones rather than be wireless standalone devices like Google Glass. 

In such a scenario it's possible that the metaverse ends up being ""developed"" in an apple centric way. And like android vs Ios there opens up atleast one slot for a competition to exist.

And maybe, FB wants to fill that slot before someone else does.

2021-11-13 09:34:15,"Progressive has long been an outperformer at rating/selecting insurance risk. I believe they had an edge (long ago) insuring individuals with DUIs, because they selected the ones who had children after, presumably a major reason for them to improve their life. I don't follow telematics in detail, but I don't think these technologies provide a *permanent* advantage to an insurance underwriter, because what it really depends on is how long it takes others to adopt it. Competitors might be behind the curve, but they'll make attempts to better classify driver risk. Firms like Verisk will want to provide the tools for this if they want to maintain their position as a provider of data as well.

The wildcard, which could provide a long runway, is that segmentation could become more and more precise over time to include factors such as traffic congestion levels on the routes you drive and the specific time of day. Maybe the vast amounts of variables will provide a decade of competitive advantage as Progressive rides ""the wave"". 

I'm not 100% sure though, because if you go back to the 1980s, the ability to segment risk that deeply was somewhat taken away before. In that case, it had to do with marketing tactics, because (some?) auto insurers were called out for only advertising (via billboards, etc.) in *certain* parts of town... technically, the insurance rate available was for all in the jurisdiction (non-discriminatory), but if you only put your ads on one side of the town, it's not made known to everyone as fairly and indirectly created some discrimination.

I'm not sure where the limits will end up. When I last looked, Progressive just wasn't cheap enough by my rudimentary benchmarks, and I'm naturally a bit more cautious about growth in areas like workers comp, which can carry long-tailed risks. I guess if anyone will do it well, Progressive has the right culture, but I can't help but wonder if it's a distraction from focusing on their auto business that they have managed well for a long time. If anyone here follows Progressive in more detail, I'd be curious to hear what you think."

That's how they know of it then, as a borrower from the bank or investor via stock ownership, and not as a lender themselves. I just wasn't sure on the full relationship.

With the initial comment you made (and thank you for following up!), it sounded like there was a group here that more broadly followed banking credit trends. That would have been of crazy high interest to learn from more experienced individuals. 

FRC is a little niche you've found and gotten to know - thank you for sharing the information."
2021-11-12 09:26:25,"I wouldn't say that, but more that it fits with FRC's attempt to market themselves to HNW individuals and be a one stop shop for them.  As if you are HNW in that area, it isn't unusual to have a concentrated illiquid type of wealth (such as a PE fund or carry interest, restricted stock of some nature) or be invested in such things (such as an LP), and if such a person needs liquidity but still in the banking realm, FRC is one of the few places to turn, as they have built out such an arm.  No idea what their rates are, as the few bankers that I've talk to that will lend against private stock will only do so at mid-terms (usually fully amort 3-6 years, and something like prime plus 2.5-3)."

You can see multiple recording engineers being involved in a song when you don’t really need more than one.

2021-11-11 16:36:08,Interesting - thanks for following up. It sounds like they consider those loans as a way to earn more yield? So maybe the folks in that subreddit are finding a way to participate directly with the loans?
2021-11-11 15:33:15,"Loan/asset growth is limited by growth in shareholder's equity, unless leverage increases (and it can't keep increasing every year). The bank could grow its equity by retaining earnings, and/or issuing more equity. So without issuing any more equity, the maximum growth in equity, in case the bank retains 100% of earnings, is the ROE = earnings/equity.

Therefore a loan growth that outpaces ROE indicates that new equity is being issued (or leverage is increasing). That is how ROE and loan growth are linked.

And for the sake of clarity, this is ROE, not ROE growth."

Maybe velocity of money has components driven by demographics and slower moving aspects such as people's view of scarcity. The other thing... she (I respect Lyn to be clear) has a chart of money supply growth, but I don't see the negative impact I expected from the removal of silver in the US in 1873. I believe this had an impact for many decades until around 1932 when it was brought back in.

One other comment... currency debasement is confusing. Back in the day, you could take the edges off of a coin and form new coin. If you put in 1 coin in the bank and then got back something 1/2 the size, you'd probably immediately tell your customers, ""I need either 2 of the new size, or 1 older."" It's a little less obvious when currency is effectively digital. (This is not a crypto comment, but just referring to use of credit cards, bank accounts, etc. as opposed to a physical debasement)

2021-05-09 15:45:09,"Distributors get paid a bonus in the form of points for recruiting associates during their first 6 weeks as a distributor (refer to page 10). IIRC, their filings don't reveal any info related to the ""President's Circle,"" which is an exclusive group comprised of top-performing distributors (i.e., those who have an extensive downline). I don't think BWMX's model is predatory per se, but it clearly incentivizes recruitment efforts. Another example would be the gift prices: they offer catalog items (usually SKUs that don't sell) at a steep discount to associates, who can then go on to resell those items for a considerable profit (e.g. 1000 peso catalog item sold at an 80% discount). BWMX is essentially using associates as an inventory liquidation channel, and these associates end up taking the bait by purchasing these items - items that they end up giving away via raffles or end up using themselves because they don't sell. There are some parallels you can draw b/w the ""pre-reform"" Herbalife model and current-day BWMX, albeit they are very very different (BWMX sells products that end customers seem to like). In short, BWMX is a good business, but an MLM nonetheless.

Transportation costs have risen significantly over the past few years with the state owned petroleum company becoming privatized- subsidized gasoline used to be $1 cheaper than in the usa but now it is more expensive because it is imported from the usa. Also look at corn prices increasing, corn is the basis of the Mexican diet and is eaten daily. 

This doesn't leave much extra money to spend on home accessories. Looking at the catalog, anything in it could probably be picked up cheaper at the local market/swap meet. So it would have to really be better stuff to want to buy from them. Since they have grown so much over the years, it probably is better. But I wouldn't count on radical growth in Mexico or other (poorer) Latin American countries.

I'm not trying to knock your analysis, I'm just offering potential bear cases from my personal experience."

&gt;I do understand their acccounting. Just because it isn't illegal doesnt make it less shady. Enron's Accounting was also legal, and just like Enron they book it mark to mark.

I think the converse could be true. Just because the accounting looks weird doesn't necessarily make it shady.

And I Respectfully disagree about mark to market. They don't really book it ""mark to market"". That phrase refers to marking a security to market based on publicly traded data. This doesn't apply for the commissions receivable, which isn't publicly traded. Its more like accounts receivable except that it's longer term. 

I can expand on how commissions receivable is more like accounts receivable than an securities held for sale if you need. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's because every year they grow their customer base, they are expending more to acquire members and their cash inflows members will come in the upcoming years. Once their growth slows, their cash inflows will eventually start becoming larger than their outflows.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is not how cash flow works if you have a proper stable cash flow.

Respectfully disagree. Let's play out a simple scenario. You acquire 1 member in year 1, then 2 members in year 2, 2 member in year 3, 1 member in year 4. Then no new members after that. For ease of discussion, let's say life is 3 years, LTV is 900, and CAC is 600.  Your cashflows are as follows: 

* Year 1: - 300 (paid 600 upfront for CAC of 1 new member and received 1/3rd LTV of 300)
* Year 2: -300 (paid 1200 upfront for CAC  of 2 new members and received 1/3rd LTV from priors member of 300 and 1/3rd LTV from the 2 current years member of 600)
* Year 3: 300 (paid 1200 upfront for CAC  of 2 new member and received the final third of year 1 member for 300, received the 2nd year's 1/3rd LTV totally 600, and received current years LTV of 600 )
* Year 4: 900 (paid 600 upfront for CAC of 1 new member and received the final third of year 2 members for 600, received the 3rd year's 1/3rd LTV totally 600, and received 1/3rd LTV for current year of 300)
* Year 5: 600 +300
* Year 6: 300

Total Cashflows for all years should be: 

6 members \* (LTV 900 - CAC 600) = 6 \* 300 = 1800

And this reconciles to the example I laid out to you. Year 2 and 3 was when growth slowed and it was the beginning of it being cashflow positive. So once its market share stabilizes, it'll be cashflow positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As long as LTVs &gt; CAC plus other expenses, the company is profitable regardless of churn.  
&gt;  
&gt;No that can't be said like that. There is only a certain amount of people that will use their service. If their churn rate is high, that decreases.

Maybe at more mature stages of the market. Currently, the market is growing quickly so even if you lose some members, you have others to sell to. 

But to directly address churn. This is something that they are working to directly address. In fact, in Q1 earnings, they talk about how they've been recapturing members that have churned. However, they didn't change the way they measure churn. If a member switches from one insurance product to another sold by EHTH, that member is still considered churn even though they still have an active insurance policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I would argue that most 65+ don't go to the website to check it, so if their insurance gives them a deal, a lot would take it. the fact that a lot of their orders come via phone and not online seems to confirm that.

Believe it or not, more of their transactions has been going through the online platform. It's in the Earnings Slides. You can compare the most recent quarter to earlier quarters. The argument for this is that as more people turn 65, the new cohort of 65 year olds are more tech savvy than the previous one. The numbers represent this and you can see the trend in our life.  The 60 year old guy working an office job would know how to use the internet for e-mails and browse the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Seems to me the risk is way to high to invest.

That's fine. Appreciate the conversation."
2021-05-07 16:39:39,"&gt; They are actually complaint with US GAAP and have an unqualified opinion  from their auditors. I actually think that negative sentiment about  their accounting is because the market doesn't understand its  accounting, which makes this an opportunity for those who do.

&gt;  But potential enrollees won't be able to directly compare plans at each  Traditional Insurance Companies website. It's more convenient to go to a  marketplace where all that information is gathered and organized for  you.

2021-05-07 13:39:17,"Thanks for your comment, I appreciate your questions! I moved some of your sentences around below so I can address each question more concisely: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why would anyone not use Medicare directly from the government but through a third party? 

Because eHealth's website is better. See the link below

[https://www.doughroller.net/insurance/alternatives-healthcare-gov-coming-soon/](https://www.doughroller.net/insurance/alternatives-healthcare-gov-coming-soon/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As the government Medicare websites gets improved and online insurance customer seemingly having no loyalty how will they get to your price target?

Yeah, this is a good question. I would argue that this is a threat to eHealth's business. Arguably speaking, it's direct competitors (SLQT and GoHealth) have platforms that would be a threat to EHTH as well. So let me generalize this question to a comparison between for-profit entities competing with governmental entities. I think for-profit entites have the funds and intention to protect their source of income. So from this standpoint, if they need to invest to stay competitive and get customers, they will. Government entities, on the other hand, don't have this profit motive. They may update their website/tech periodically. But do you really believe that the government will regularly invest in tech? I think they are slower to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Their accounting is quite shady. Looking at their cash flow statement from 2018 they had surging revenue (maybe due to their accouting change), a huge drop off in accts receivables (cancelships and lost payments) so they actually have negative cash flow from operations and finance that cash flow by the sale an issuance of stock. Even with those sheenanigans they are far from cheap or good value. 

They are actually complaint with US GAAP and have an unqualified opinion from their auditors. I actually think that negative sentiment about their accounting is because the market doesn't understand its accounting, which makes this an opportunity for those who do. Here's a resource to refer to understand the rules and how eHealth is in compliance:

[https://www.bkd.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/Revenue-Changes-for-Insurance-Brokers.pdf](https://www.bkd.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/Revenue-Changes-for-Insurance-Brokers.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to take this time to point out that accounting rules don't always reflect the real economics of the business. Sometimes you have to make your own adjustments on US GAAP to derive your Free Cash Flow. For example, treating of Operating Leases in the past and the value of land. 

Specifically with EHTH, you have to convert LTVs and CAC to cashflows that you think are reasonable.  Let's say your member's policy life is 3 years. Then for each member: 

* Year 1 Net Cash outflow (Full amount of outflow from CAC and 1/3 of inflow from LTV)
* Year 2 Cash Inflow (1/3 inflow of LTV)
* Year 3 Cash Inflow (1/3 inflow of LTV)

So from that, hopefully I've answered why there's Negative cashflow. It's because every year they grow their customer base, they are expending more to acquire members and their cash inflows members will come in the upcoming years. Once their growth slows, their cash inflows will eventually start becoming larger than their outflows. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also their churn rates are quite high (in Q4 2019 is was 42% -  so 42% were no longer their customer after 1 year -  for an insurance that is absolutly terrible). 

I think you're focusing on churn too much as a key metric. In my opinion, it's really a second order metric. LTV's is the first order metric you should be concerned with. As stated in my post, LTV is derived from commission rates and the life of the insurance policy. As long as LTVs &gt; CAC plus other expenses, the company is profitable regardless of churn.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As they book their Life Time Values of their customers on Day 1 -  profits should be high, yet they are barely profitable even with them booking customer aquistions on a mark to mark basis.

It's reported positive net income since before they got into the Medicare Business so not sure what you're referring to exactly. If you clarify, I'd be happy to address it.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Furthermore the e-Healthmarket is very fragmented and new entrats show up every day (even if they are also shady like Clover Health). As more traditional insurance companies enter this space, what will deter them from just taking eHealths potential customers?

The market is very fragmented because it's a new and growing market. It only started existing in 2016 - 2017? Entrants are showing up because the total addressable market is huge and they believe it is highly profitable. The medicare advantage policies are actually provided to members by Traditional Insurance Companies (Cigna for example). But potential enrollees won't be able to directly compare plans at each Traditional Insurance Companies website. It's more convenient to go to a marketplace where all that information is gathered and organized for you. Hence customers would prefer to search for a plan on a platform like eHealths than to go to each insurance companies website.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;eHealth is not a new company. It is more than 15 years public and never be able to generate proper cashflow. I would say it should be 20$ or less and not 100$.

Yes, eHealth is not new. However, their management team is new, Scott Flanders started with them in 2016. Derek Yung started in 2018. Additionally, the current Medicare Segment, which comprises of 88% of Revenues, was started around 2016ish - 2017.  So for all intents and purposes, they are practically a new business. To further drive my point, the Netflix Streaming Business is a very different business from the Netflix DVD snail mail rental business."

For example, the company reported huge losses on its derivative contracts. However, I guess these are all covered contracts (were the company sold say soybeans but it had them of would obtain them after the harvest). Are these losses notional, non-cash?

Contra 3. Discount broking is capturing customers but there are many who can't switch due to switching costs and stickiness.

Contra 5. IIFL Finance is split off from Securities and the management is different. I wasn't aware about Finance's unethical practices but I will investigate.

If you research a little bit you will know why IIFL's fortunes seem to be declining. Many take 2018 as the base which is the year the spinoff happened so that's understandable. However, 2018 was the peak of a bull market in India, with lots of IPOs and retail interest. That market lost steam and for a few years IIFL's revenues and profits fell by double digits.

4. Current pricing model unsustainable. All discount brokers give 0 brokerage for cash trading, while IIFL charges double digit basis points. This will have to come off if the company has to stay relevant. Once the pricing falls, so will the revenues.

5. I won't go into the controlling shareholders' integrity issues (read about IIFL finance's lending and evergreening practices), but not the cleanest set of people out there.

2021-05-04 23:51:03,"&gt; The plan to consummate a merger is the latest twist in Hometown’s puzzling corporate existence, which began with its incorporation in Nevada in 2014. Barely a year later, the company filed for an initial public offering, identifying itself in a 2015 SEC submission as “the originator of a new delicatessen concept” featuring “‘homestyle’ sandwiches and other entrées in a casual and friendly atmosphere”.


&gt; That draft prospectus, filed before the Paulsboro deli opened its doors or even “fully executed” a lease, prompted the SEC to write a letter to Morina stating: “We believe that you are a shell company”. Morina shot back that the company had purchased new carpets, taken down walls and doors, put in gas pipes and wiring for refrigerators, and bought an oven with six burners, among other equipment — all to “accomplish its goal of [a] grand opening”.

&gt; Hometown began selling sandwiches in October 2015, but it would take longer before the public could buy shares in the company that owned it. Most of the stock was owned by Morina and his fellow director Christine Lindenmuth, who teaches mathematics at the high school where Morina is principal.

&gt; A few dozen financial investors put up $180,000 between them, in return for a roughly 5 per cent stake, in a private placement that began in 2014. Among the early backers were a state superior court judge and his wife, and several people who appear to be relatives or associates of Peter Coker, a North Carolina businessman.

&gt; Large blocks of shares have occasionally changed hands in off-market transactions. In March last year, shortly after he became chair, Coker’s son Peter Coker Jr bought a 29 per cent stake from Lindenmuth and immediately sold the shares to three separate purchasers.

&gt; The following month Hometown struck its boundary-pushing deal with an investment firm.

&gt; Hong Kong-based Maso Capital is in many ways the opposite of the meme traders that have taken stock markets on their wild ride. For much of the past decade, Maso has busied itself finding ways to help cash-rich companies in Asia transition to nimbler balance sheets. Last year Maso even launched a Spac, with Coker Jr as a director.

&gt; “We’re not afraid to roll up our sleeves and be innovators,” Maso’s co-chief investment officer Manoj Jain said. “We’re viewed as proponents of good governance in the region.”

&gt; Where Einhorn sees an overvalued food service business in southern New Jersey, Jain sees a way to control a US acquisition company on the cheap. “The concept of shell companies has existed globally for many years,” he said. “These are broadly quasi-dormant public companies, that can be used to merge with private companies quickly and easily.”

&gt; According to Jain, repurposing an existing business for M&amp;A is an efficient way to extend the Spac model to smaller deals. “The target companies we’re speaking to are in the $300m to $600m zip code in terms of valuation,” he said. “To get it to work from a public market perspective, the Spac needs to be $75m to $100m.”

&gt; A Spac has cash. We can value cash. The deli might have pickles and pastrami, but I doubt they’ve got $100m worth of pickles and pastrami

&gt; Joseph Grundfest, law professor at Stanford Law School and former SEC commissioner

&gt; Yet setting up a Spac can cost millions of dollars in administration fees alone, eating up a large portion of the value in such a small deal. “[Hometown] is a more flexible structure . . . with a longer time to find a target, and a better economic uplift,” Jain said.

&gt; “It works like a mini-Spac,” he added. “When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes, as the merged entity enters the US capital markets.”

&gt; Not everyone is convinced. “This doesn’t work at all,” Coffee said. “The [over-the-counter market] doesn’t give you real liquidity. All you get is the ability to negotiate on a bulletin board with a possible purchaser on the other side.” However, Jain believes that, with the right acquisition target, Hometown may be able to list on the Nasdaq exchange. Yet last week the company was pushed further away from the investment mainstream when trading venue OTC Markets attached a warning to its shares.

&gt; While some shareholders have recorded big gains, trading has been so thin that Hometown’s $100m valuation may be little more than hypothetical. Duke and Vanderbilt paid $1 a year ago for shares that were quoted at $13 this week, and investors who went in before 2016 have done even better on paper. Yet fewer than 2 per cent of Hometown’s shares changed hands in stock market transactions over the past 18 months, according to data from Senteio.

&gt; Uncertainty over Hometown’s valuation could yet thwart the company’s M&amp;A plans. “Who will want to merge their company into a deli and give them a $100m valuation?” asks Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford and former SEC commissioner. “A Spac has cash. We can value cash. The deli might have pickles and pastrami, but I doubt they’ve got $100m worth of pickles and pastrami.”

&gt; Despite the limited market for Hometown’s shares, Wall Street scrutiny has at least invigorated demand for its sandwiches. Philadelphia Magazine was among the outlets to publish a restaurant review last week. When the FT ordered a cheesesteak, a clerk suggested adding a $15 dollar T-shirt with the Hometown logo and the slogan “Eat so we both don’t starve”.

&gt; “I’m keeping your credit card,” said the clerk, briefly looking as though she might be serious. “And if you write a bad review, I’m going to keep charging it.”"
2021-05-04 23:50:55,"&gt; Duke and Vanderbilt universities, two of the most prestigious seats of learning in the US, are among the biggest shareholders of a company that owns a single sandwich shop in New Jersey and has a stock market valuation of $100m despite recording just $13,976 in sales last year.

&gt; The delicatessen in Paulsboro, a dusty refinery town abutting the Delaware river near Philadelphia, has attained notoriety on Wall Street after its parent company Hometown International was named by hedge fund manager David Einhorn as an example of the “quasi-anarchy” that he said had taken hold in financial markets.

&gt; “The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn quipped in a letter to investors a fortnight ago, citing Hometown’s nine-figure valuation as an example of how toothless financial regulators were permitting a destructive feeding frenzy. “Small investors who get sucked into these situations,” he wrote, “are likely to be harmed.”

&gt; Hometown has filed financial statements as a public company since 2015. Its shares are not listed on an exchange, making them far less liquid than blue-chip stocks; instead they trade “over the counter” through a network of broker-dealers who negotiate transactions with potential buyers and sellers. On a typical day, trades in Hometown’s stock add up to only a few thousand dollars. Yet the share price has soared, from $1.25 in October 2019 to $13 this week.

&gt; Unlike GameStop and other “meme stocks” that have ridden a wave of interest from housebound day traders, Hometown’s valuation was propelled not by amateur speculators but institutional investors. Among its key backers is a Hong Kong firm set up by up by veterans of Och-Ziff Capital Management, which sees its investment as a potentially lucrative variation on the special purpose acquisition companies that have recently helped to drive corporate dealmaking to 40 year highs.

&gt; It works like a mini-Spac. When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes

&gt; Manoj Jain, co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital
Through a review of securities filings and public records, and interviews with key insiders, the Financial Times has pieced together this account of one of the strangest episodes in an extraordinary period for US capital markets — one that has appalled some experts. “[This] is a self-parody of a Spac,” said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University’s law school who has written about hostile takeovers. “And that is what I would expect at the end of a bubble.”

&gt; Hometown “has had limited success operating its current delicatessen”, a lawyer for the company told the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. During a recent lunchtime rush, three customers waited in a harshly lit dining room while staff tended the griddle and struggled with a temperamental credit card machine.

&gt; The company has excelled, however, at raising cash. Hometown brought in $2.5m in a private share placement in April last year, despite a six-month closure of its deli prompted by New Jersey governor Phil Murphy’s pandemic stay-at-home order. About $1m has already gone to cover last year’s losses, loan repayments and other outgoings, according to financial statements filed in March. By December last year, the kitchen was open again, with monthly losses of about $70,000 — and enough cash to sustain them for more than a year.


&gt; Duke university is one of the biggest shareholders in Hometown International © Lance King/Getty
Much of that money came from the multibillion-dollar endowments of Duke and Vanderbilt universities, which together invested about $2m. Both colleges referred questions about their investments to Maso Capital, a Hong Kong-based investment firm.

&gt; Now, Hometown plans to use what remains of the cash to fund a business acquisition that sounds as if it would set the company on a trajectory leading far beyond Paulsboro. The company, whose chief executive Paul Morina is also chief wrestling coach and principal at a nearby high school, is keeping an open mind about what it will acquire.

&gt; “We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location,” Hometown told investors in March. That phrase echoed a formulation commonly used by “blank cheque” companies, or Spacs, which raise capital on the stock market as empty corporate shells and use the cash to go shopping for deals.

&gt; Spacs are fuelling America’s mergers and acquisitions boom, accounting for $172bn worth of US corporate acquisitions in the first quarter, according to data from Refinitiv, and persuading emerging technology companies including Lucid Motors, a rival to the electric car maker Tesla, and the online broker eToro to embrace public ownership.

&gt; Although critics say Spacs are a lightly regulated backdoor to the stock market, which allows untested companies to go public with little scrutiny, the vehicles are gaining widespread acceptance. Still, experts say it is unusual for a business such as Hometown with existing operations to try to reinvent itself as a blank-cheque company, years after it filed to become a public company."

2020-11-03 18:40:59,"I'm pretty divided on this action.  First, I think it's hard to argue harms, since Google has the better product, and has for a long time.  I'm very familiar with the other options, and all of them just are not as good.

However, it's hard to argue with the author's point about the virtuous cycle Google has setup to feed this, with better searches leading to more traffic, which leads to more searches.  I'm not really sure how you can fix this, and allow other companies a better opportunity to compete.

I don't really think it's search that's necessarily a problem here, so much as it is their domination of online internet advertising.  A lot of the harms generated from Google (other than their constant cancelling of products) comes from the need to make money selling advertising.  It might be possible to separate out their current ad network for Android and other places from the ads sold on search, and de-integrate that part of the company.  This could potentially generate enough revenue for other companies to compete in search.  It would also fix some of the sneaky stuff going on with their domination of browsers, and subsequent removal of ad blocking capabilities from Chrome.

What bothers me here is the knock on effect of a rule that prevents them from paying for placement of their search.  If this happens that is a death sentence for Firefox, since they derive a massive amount of their revenue from this agreement.  With the movement of Edge to be a UI around the Chromium Embedded Framework, and Safari being based on a similar branch from WebKit, that would leave us back where we were when Microsoft's IE dominated browsers.

Allowing one company to completely control browsers would give a strangle hold over the internet."

*Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.*

In the context of the antitrust situation, it doesn't seem so innocent any more and especially because it has held others back from developing scale.

I'll just throw out an additional risk... the lack of advertising revenue growth at non-tech firms has probably been one of the reasons that small distribution newspapers can't make it. If they, and other ad revenue based companies, are feeling similar pressures and complaining to their political representatives, it may create all the more desire to create regulation for internet advertising.

GloFo had to license Samsungs process to stay relevant

[https://www.globalfoundries.com/news-events/press-releases/samsung-and-globalfoundries-forge-strategic-collaboration-deliver-multi](https://www.globalfoundries.com/news-events/press-releases/samsung-and-globalfoundries-forge-strategic-collaboration-deliver-multi)

And Intel's fabs/process has had a 5 year delay, leading them to seriously consider turning fabless.

You mean to tell me that TSMC and Samsung license US technology and IP, and yet are able to provide better fabs and processes than US companies?

You silly goose do some research."

Interestingly, in Jeremy Siegel's ""Stocks for the Long Run"", he says Altria has been one of the best total returns ever (this was from the updated version of the book published a few years ago), and his rationale was that since Altria has been so hated for so long, it has depressed the valuation, which has allowed Altria to return cash to shareholders at very attractive rates. The current environment seems like an extreme version of this. I think if they can tack on a meaningful share repurchase program to their meaty dividend, this stock can start to work in a big way."

For a $500,000 home, do you really think knowing an inspector, lender, negotiating, and drawing up the correct paper work is worth $35,000 (7% commission)? 

It’s more work, but Is hiring a RE attorney, finding an inspector (through reviews or other people you know), and showing the house really worth that much? If your house has a fair market value of $500,000, wouldn’t it be better to list at $475-485,000 and handle it yourself? 

Priced to get interest from the beginning, and having the right people in place and you’ll still come out ahead after your costs. This part time job for 1-2 months just earned you an extra $10-15000 dollars. Not bad for a part time gig. 

This in theory has been done for years with FSBO, but there’s a lot of bad stories about people’s experiences. If the person on the other side (Zillow) can be an easy to work with intermediary between buyer and seller, there’s even less of a reason to have an agent."
2019-04-13 12:07:34,"The price of assets are going up, but not necessarily their intrinsic value. Remember that housing indexes include larger and modern homes that are being built, this improvement cost would be added to the index on top of the land and deceive homebuyers into believing that their depreciating house will go up in value at the same rate. What homeowners should really be looking at is the inflation of land and bet that against the depreciation of their house on top of maintenance, insurance, property taxes, HOA to really get a picture of if, during a bubble, they will really turn a profit. If interest comes into play, it gets even more difficult to make a profit."

2019-04-13 12:01:36,"From what I understand asset prices are inversely correlated with interest rates which means that no one is ""winning"" when interest rates get artificially forced down low because asset prices rise in tandem such that the total cost of the debt is the same. Once the interest rates rise again, people's assets drop, most panic sell, and a deflationary spiral occurs.

In a free market, full reserve interest rate system the interest rates - price of money - would adjust for the scarcity and abundancy of lender money. When money is constrained, interest rates rise, only high profit businesses would be lent to therefore making the best use of the money available in the economy. When money is in abundance, interest rates drop, and lenders are willing to let you use their money on the cheap organically because there are not enough investments being implemented and it is time for ""experimentation"" and ""innovation"". With artificially low interest rates this ""experimentation"" goes on without any checks or balances and perpetuates malinvestment, prices keep rising, people's productivity keeps stagnating/declining and everyone becomes poorer."
2019-04-13 11:43:32,"Do investors really spend their energy caring about margins during a growth phase? I think the big ask is is there growing demand and production to eventually meet that demand.

That's why I look at the model 3 not as a profit making tool but as a gateway product. The more stubborn drivers they can switch to the electric drivetrain, the more successful they are in my eyes."

2019-04-13 09:24:09,"Housing, real estate, stocks/equities, bonds.

The price of bonds is inverse to yields/interest rates, so when rates go down, the price of bonds go up.

This also pushes up stock prices because people will make less money from parking it in savings accounts or bonds, so stocks are more attractive in comparison.

Housing and real estate prices go up due to increased demand from lower interest rates (lower monthly payments), especially when the Fed directly buys mortgage-backed securities.

The ERP seems to be getting compressed as there is a reach for yield and that will continue as long as interest rates are low.

2018-01-29 15:42:13,"Some random thoughts as to why predicting CapEx is difficult and/or not a valuable use of time:

* CapEx investment depends a lot on strategy. Is the company in a highly competitive industry where investment in equipment leads to competitive advantage? Then the business is prone to regularly invest in CapEx. However, if the business is a non capital-intensive business CapEx will rarely occur and will not be a material use of cash flow. This also fails to take into account changes in strategy which makes CapEx predictions even more uncertain.
* The depreciated value of PP&amp;E isn't a very meaningful number. A company may accelerate the depreciation of PP&amp;E for tax purposes, or match it more closely with annual CapEx for predictability. Unless you fully know the assets, expected lives, maintenance spend, etc. (which is unlikely given info limitations as a public market investor) asset value just isn't that meaningful.
* Market reactions to CapEx/investment announcement are highly dependent on the ""story"" in the market. For example, as a result of the oil price decline over the past few years, major oil cos got very disciplined and slashed their capex budgets. For them to announce big upswings in CapEx at this point would likely be viewed as negative. Similarly, a major retailer announcing a major investment in physical infrastructure or build out of a larger store network would likely be punished by the market for investing in a dying space."

They also tend to raise after completing milestones (each phase of clinical trial), giving even more precision.

2018-01-29 11:25:30,"&gt; Is it possible to predict...

No. 

And I don't mean that to be rude, but to save you a lot of time chasing down the age-old rabbit hole of trying to divine future events. Knowing the future is simply one of those things that is not-knowable can help you put your efforts to greater use.

Now, you made a fair observation about looking at a company's depreciation schedules. Which, on the face of it, seems like a reasonable strategy. EXCEPT! There may be multitude of reasons why Company A chooses a certain depreciation schedule, to the point where the literal expected life of the asset is no longer the chief concern. Depreciation is one of those things that often gets twisted and mired by the guesswork of accounting.

So what does that leave us with? Well, if it's an industry you are intimately familiar with, you might have a general sense for how long certain things stay ""in fashion"" before they start feeling dated or obsolete. And, if you have a sense for the personalities behind the management team, you might be able to glean some sort of impression about what motivated their decisions. Are they penny pinchers? Big spenders? Do they care about how others perceive them, and by extension, their company? Is it possible they feel a strong incentive to ""keep up with the Joneses""? Questions like this...

The other angle to look at is to get a sense for what management's priorities may be in relation to value. If they're rabid hawks about generating long-term value and have an incentive structure in place that rewards this long-term focus, then seeing them drop a large amount of money toward ""modernizing"" superfluous assets would probably seem highly out of character. So your thoughts might then turn toward trying to identify the ""key ingredients"" for the business. What is absolutely crucial to their dominance in xyz? What threatens that dominance? Is it something they can possibly guard against by outspending their competition in &lt;asset xyz&gt;?

Just my two cents! Take it or leave it, but maybe these thought exercises help somewhat? 

TLDR: It may be more useful to try to ""get inside the heads"" of management to understand how they view their competitive landscapes and then put yourself in their shoes. I readily admit this too may be an exercise in absurdity, but (unfortunately?) it may a bit more grounded than getting lost in the weeds in accounting as it relates to depreciation schedules."
2018-01-29 11:24:38,Penman touches on this topic well in both of his books.  Value investing is just that--determining the value of a company.  Investors can include a company's growth in that valuation if they choose.

However, due to the tax overhaul companies are able accelerate depreciation for the next 5 years. So regardless of previous run rates and investment timelines companies will be looking to invest now. "
2018-01-29 10:37:03,"Hmm.

Well first off got to account for inflation, the 25 cents of 1985 is now .57 cents according to an online inflation calculator (not scientific, ik)

2018-01-28 23:40:32,"1. Commodity business with hard assets
eg: Natural gas producers which are currently hated by the market but need to look at ones with strong balance sheet. The logic here is that the reproduction value of their assets goes up when inflation goes up. Plus Natural gas prices have been deflating for too long and inflation should help these companies.

2. Using the bridge example:

a. Cheniere Energy - its a bridge for LNG export (their contracts are linked to natural gas pricing)

b. Other heavy asset companies such as railroads or power plants
(again they are like a bridge)

3. mREIT would be a bad example for inflation proof. They hold bonds which will drop in price when interest rates go up as inflation rises.

Now, some caution: Predicting the macro is a game not worth playing. Prem Watsa predicted for years that there'd be a deflation and that never came. I think its best to buy undervalued assets and wait patiently.

2018-01-28 23:33:19,Not necessarily the case. Buzz words and macro stuff are what drive the market and most analysts take that into account sub-consciously (timing the market). No point being right on the intrinsic value of a stock but it'd take 100 years for the stock to correct itself.
2018-01-28 23:31:28,"The answer above is good. Adding some more to it:

Monish Pabrai looks for strong balance sheet and low cost producer when investing in commodity stocks. Both of these factors help a commodity company to ride the low cycle without going into bankruptcy. That is the biggest risk - getting assets taken away from equity holders. 

The uncertainty comes from not knowing when or how the commodity cycle will turn.

Cash burn shouldn't really be a concern. They're in their growth phase. This isn't Ford we're dealing with here. Capex will keep being super high.

Obviously they're nothing compared to Ford and GM, but comparing two mature stage auto manufacturers with huge cash on their hands and massive economies of scale to a 5 year old car company persuing advanced technologies from the get go is stupid.

That's a really interesting idea that gains will be competed away in the long term, which ultimately is good for consumers.  This is something that hasn't been talked about much, from what I have seen, but bodes well for consumers that now pay less than the did before."
2014-04-27 21:59:45,"Warren Buffett:

* “If you get access to an enduring and free (or less-than-free) float — whether it comes from insurance underwriting, derivatives contracts, trading stamps, travelers’ cheques, stored value cards, deferred taxes or any other source — then assets financed with such a float will become “an unencumbered source of value” for your stockholders. This will happen because (1) the assets financed with such a float would still be valued on the basis of their expected future earning power; but (2) the true value of the liability represented by the float will be far lower than its carrying value, provided the float is both costless and long-enduring.”

I agree short cash conversion cycles and negative working capital can be very beneficial provided it is not a cyclical float. "

2014-04-27 17:52:11,"OK, of course no current investor in amazon is focusing on net income/operating income. Is their mentality - that of current investors in amazon - representative of investors in aggregate? and by 'investors in aggregate' i mean people with capital to invest. certainly that is impossible to prove either way, but judging by most of what i read, i think the scale tips to the side of people focusing on P/E ratios and operating income.

I think your last point is the primary source of contention around the stock. You see the expansion into other businesses as desperation and possibly negligence. I see it as fulfilling a long-term strategy. 

The float discussion is something i find pretty interesting. there is more to it than stretching out payables, but certainly that is a big component of it. AMZN may indeed not be able to continue to generate float when growth slows meaningfully. But at that time, it shouldn't need float anymore because it won't be in ""re-invest every dollar back into the business"" mode. "

Maybe they are not indicative of general investor sentiment, but i see an overwhelming majority of people talk about those items.

Doesn't seem like you actually understood my comment. It would be hard to find a large investor in AMZN that if focused on their current net income ore operating income. I'm sure many bears have the view that after two decades, the firm should have material positive net income.

&gt;I don't know why it's troubling that AMZN generates cash from float.

This isn't a LT sustainable way to generate cash (you can only do it as long as you can push A/P days further or continue to grow sales at a fast clip), and if the money is pumped into a venture with low or negative returns on capital, then that can be troubling. 

&gt;I'd rather have them generate cash from float than issuing debt or shares.

Vendor float is nothing but a short-term liability similar to commercial paper issuance.

I won't pretend to be an expert on the firm, and I have neither a long nor short position, but I mostly see AMZN's diversification into myriad competitive businesses not as a strong bull thesis but as a desperate move to buy sales growth at an uneconomic price. "

Google gave android away for free to increase search revenue, to collect data, and probably also because they want to commoditize smartphones to lower apple's margins &amp; clout.

IaaS relative to IT spending generally is similar to ecommerce relative to retail spending generally, in that both are tiny pieces of gigantic and growing markets. AWS will not be solely an IaaS business in 10 years, they will do everything they can to spread out into the greater IT market. "
2014-04-27 15:07:55,"This is free research, and the blogger is a notable producer of large quantities of articles that arent flagged by google as blogspam as they ought to, so what do you expect?"
2014-04-27 14:56:06,"I think of the current state of AWS as similar to AMZN's retail business 15 years ago. Start with books and then relentlessly expand the product selection over time. With AWS, they are starting with cloud computing and cloud storage, and they will expand their service offerings over time. Lots of enterprise-focused IT companies have operating margins way above 10%. I would be surprised if AWS, in 10 years, still focused solely on IaaS. 

AMZN doesn't disclose margins, as you noted. I've seen estimates for AWS gross margins from 40% to 90%. Operating margins are lower than they could be, imo, because they are investing every dollar back into the company, just like they are with retail. That doesn't mean AWS operating margins are destined to be low forever. It means they are focused on building market share.

Free shipping is just one of the many reasons why AMZN has consistently taken market share over time. It will be interesting to see what happens when the free two day shipping becomes free one day shipping and then maybe even same-day or same-hour for certain products.

2014-04-27 12:49:26,"yeah ok this article pisses me off.

if you are just a normal person who is casually reading this sub reddit there is a 99%+ chance you will not notice the huge error this guy makes.

it's not just an error as in a mistake its an error as in the guy writing the blog has no idea what he is talking about.

using a black scholes calculator is not complicated there are very few inputs....yet he still fucks that up completely

the only number that should be debatable is the volatility you are assuming....here is using 18% looking briefly at recent historical vol and the past few years this number is not completely unreasonable....i would not argue strongly with anyone who was running any number here in the teens.

BUT he's not using the risk free rate of return AND THAT IS A FUCKING HUGE FLAG THAT HE HAS NO CLUE WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT

the risk free rate of return is pretty damn near zero right now. in fact rates are so low if you short stock against a long warrant position to capture volatility by gamma hedging you are probably PAYING interest on your short capital.

there is literally NO ONE on the planet who knows what they are doing that is not using a risk free rate of 0.1-1% to price options out into the next few years.  

THIS guy has decided that since the company has guided to 8% growth that that is what the risk free rate of return as an input into black scholes is.  HE HAS NO CLUE WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT

In conclusion using the actual risk free rate of return inputted into a black scholes calculator gives you a number very close to the 1.85 that i am seeing the public markets have priced them at. 


TLDR;  the only reason this blogger thinks warrants that are trading at 1.85 are worth 4.80 or 6.60 is because he doesn't have the slightest understanding of what is meant when talking about risk free rate of return.  he is assuming it is 8% or 10% instead of &lt;1%.

I would also suggest they cut the dividend and use the proceeds to pay down debt - if the stock craters they could use some to buy back shares and avoid double taxation.

Depreciation is the biggest component of CFO so they are a Cap heavy business.  That's not necessarily a bad thing  but their actual cap-ex is about ~44% of their Dep charges.  This means they are not spending to replace old assets which makes their cash flows look good.  Eventually they will have to spend more on cap ex and FCF will decline.

If you can not project future free cash flows, it's not a possible task.  You have to assume that they will be successful.  If successful, they will generate $X in revs.  If they make that in revs, assume 10% of that will go to FCF.  Then use a 10x multiple.  Add in total equity.

If you do this as a bag of stocks investment, determine the probability of success.  If 25%, multiple the resultant market cap for 0.25

Look at the shares outstanding and add to that any convertible debt.  With that you get your fair share price.

Where to buy?   Toss in a 50% margin of safety since this is a VERY tough thing to value.

That's all there is to it.  Valuation is simple.  The hard part is understanding the business and where it is going.

Man, college courses are such a waste.  With practice, valuation should take 5 minutes.

Almost forgot.  Let me guess, this company is in growth mode so it is constantly issuing shares and diluting current shareholders.

2014-04-25 15:56:23,"Thanks and I completely agree. Utility maximization, game theory, incentives, the invisible hand and the all important opportunity cost is all I found useful. I have taken about 5 econ classes as electives and the only useful one seemed to be labor economics. It was not the class but the teacher telling it how it was and calling bullshit on most conventional statistical measures. 

Most of what is taught in business school is bull shit and it is a shame. 

It is nice to find the straight shooting profs still out there, not afraid to criticize conventional wisdom and traditional theories. Unfortunately [in my opinion] thinking for yourself can't be taught and I seem to think it comes about from finding authority fallible at a young age. Although that is my anecdote for identifying as a skeptical optimist and contrarian in most walks of life. 

I am glad you cited wealth of nations as it sits on my bedside for casual passage re-reading as you can never get enough Smith. "

2014-04-25 10:18:33,"As an economics graduate from a UC school that attacked current economic concepts, cheers! Its funny, i finally got one economics professor to confess to me, away from the students that the vast majority of what is taught in schools is wrong and that students are taking the concepts as fact when the assumptions dont apply to reality. You have to adjust accordingly and think for yourself. 

I found utility maximization combined with game theory is pretty much a solid approach to economic thinking with some tweaks here and there, mostly intangible stuff. also, most of undergraduate econ can be summed up in wealth of nations by adam smith. "
2014-04-25 02:56:44,totally stupid to pick a fledgling company with probably zero revenues as your first major valuation project.  pick an established company with an easily defined market.
2014-04-25 02:45:09,"Oh man, that's rough =/ there's a template for valuing high growth/early stage firms - http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/ - under ""high growth"". She can use that format for her valuation model if she likes.

Is she volunteering to go early? She does not have to incorporate the newest earnings statement, assuming her investment horizon is long term (i.e. over a year). She can just preface her presentation by saying the investment recommendation was based off data for 4/15 or 4/1 (whatever day she picked to use has the initial/actual stock price). 

Also some general advice for her - don't freak out about the valuation #s. Nobody is going to be sitting there calculating her inputs/# checking. All she has to do is have logic behind each assumption - i.e. my revenue growth rate was X based off a median/average peer group/industry group, etc all the way down. Have her do a quick explanation (""I grouped their closet comps, broke out their revenue over the last X years, and took the average"". Then gloss over your actual input #s quickly).

Since she has so little time to prepare it might be really hard to break down a peer group thoroughly, so quickly gathering their margins/growth rate/capex rates and taking the median or average and using it on a DCF should do the trick. 

Sell the growth story here - all the stuff they talk about in the intro to their 10k. Use that info (# of treatments, $$ in industry, how new it is, why its crucial). I didn't check if they had negative earnings (assuming it is negative though) but pick revenue/cost growth assumptions. If it's really bad # wise maybe go slightly positive 3rd or 4th year. Have her stress that the time horizon is long for this recommendation (atleast 1 year, I'd say 2-3 yrs). 

I remember doing my senior projects I picked some #s straight out of equity research reports + industry reports, and simply used past history to extrapolate some % (that were reasonable). It was a very minor portion of the presentation, so don't sweat the #s. People in the industry still struggle with that shit, no one expects her to get the #s right. 

Oh another trick she can use if she doesn't like her valuation price at the end is discount it ~25-30%, and justify it using the time horizon + a peer group that is trading at a discount due to the enormous uncertainty/risk about the trials + success. She can throw in a probability of success rate for young firms in that field and pretty much get away with any # she wants. "
2014-04-25 02:03:10,"Is this for an undergraduate class, or something more advanced? I'm assuming undergrad, so sorry if this is comes across as basic:

It'll be pretty hard to do any sort of valuation based on an absolute/intrinsic value. They have no financial history, very few comps, and a high chance for growth/failure. Leafing through their 10k they still have a long way to go in terms of expanding their network, testing, trials, etc

You'd probably be best off starting with the comps they listed (page 32 of most recent 10k). Figure out who is most similar, and how the established firms started in terms of their revenue/costs (particularly R&amp;D/capex), growth, and clinical trials. Look how their stock price moved as they went from testing--&gt;commercialization. You can take weighted averages there to use as your forecast assumptions/stock price, adjusting for size/fundamentals.

You can also look up industry analyses from your school's database and figure out if there any specific metrics that may apply here or unique valuations (I believe clinical trials is huge for pharma firms, not exactly sure of the unique ratios/metrics they use). 

Also if it's still an option your gf might be better off switching to a more established company. Usually these type of projects have caps like the firm must have been public for atleast 5 years (so it has a track record of fin statements). If she can switch to an established firm the valuation will become tremendously easier to complete/justify

Could you maybe give some more detail as to why this is a ripoff of existing shareholders? As far as i see it they receive the 3620 of value in the new company as well as 6380 in cash (total uses - debt repayment - transaction costs - new equity share = 18050 - 8000 - 50 - 3620 = 6380). The new equity stake and the cash adds up to 10000 (3620 + 6380 = 10000) which is equal to the value of the company at takeover (100 shares * 100 price). 

Am I missing something?"
2014-04-24 00:58:12,"It looks to be right based on what you have outlined above. (Management and LBO fund make off like bandits while existing shareholders suffer - based on proportional capital invested)

It's definitely never ""required"" to publish letters between you and a company, but if you'd like to make your opinion known by posting it in a public place you are certainly allowed to do so.

Ackman's argument is that these aren't true sales to a real customer but rather they are products sold to people in training programs and their family and friends for the sole prospect of becoming potential distributors. In other words, people aren't buying product because they are happy cusomters who enjoy it. This clear distinction is what is extremely important, and I think Ackman made a pretty damning case. The fact that Herbalife keeps no record of it's retail sales is mind-boggling. It blatantly shows, in my opinion, that there is something to hide and a reason they don't want to collect that information. This is a *huge* red flag. People complain that there was no smoking gun or evidence, but Ackman's case was that the reason this scheme has gone on so long is because Herbalife has been able to conceal the ""facts"" so well.

The sign-up cost was $500 and by signing up, they promised that yes, one day we can be where he is.

In my area, it got to the point where the female upline would give out sexual services in order to recruit members.

It seemed very odd to me that a man who always seems so calculated compared the company to the Nazis and called the CEO a predator.

Even the lead attorney working on the case for Pershing Square admitted that having the ability to subpoena documents would be incredibly beneficial to their thesis.

If anybody would be sensitive about name calling I assume it would be Bill. He was called a ""financial terrorist"" by MBIA after one of his short presentations and in the book Confidence Game it touches on how personal he took the name calling."

2014-07-18 16:00:42,"Although you aren't wrong about the accounting entries when a sale is made on credit / inventory purchased on credit, you're basically just saying changes in working capital are either a draw or source of cash. Which is correct but not answering his question.

In typical corporate valuation (not value investing), you forecast changes in working capital in tandem with sales growth. Sales growth requires capex (investment in equipment, tangible or intangible) but also investment in working capital to handle higher volume day-to-day operations.  For example, if sales go up 10%, you would expect receivables to go up 10% as well. This would be a draw on cash. 

But in value investing you first start with ZERO GROWTH free cash flows so sales growth = zero and hence change in WC = zero. So another adjustment you would make is maintenance capex instead of total capex (since growth capex = zero if sales growth = zero)."

Seth Klarman is trying to calculate ZERO GROWTH free cash flow, which assumes working capital will remain constant.

Investopedia / typical corporation valuation methods assume growth in revenues (or decline) and hence forecast that working capital will grow (or shrink) with revenue.
"
2014-07-18 14:51:32,"the latter.  here's why

suppose you sell widgets to me and i dont give you cash, i promise to give you cash in 3 months.  revenues have gone up, earnings after tax have gone up and so FCF has gone up if you follow the first formula

however, we're talking about CASH here.  i havent given you the cash.  your accounts receivable have gone up which means the revenue increase counts the sale but omits the fact that cash hasnt been received.  so it needs to be removed, reducing FCF which is why the 2nd equation is better

same argument holds if you buy inventory but dont pay cash yet, the earnings go down by the amount you owe but the cash hasnt come off so you add it back.  "

This sub reddit is about value investing. the concepts of alpha and beta are completely against value investing. I could be wrong, but i doubt it. I just read a comment where seth klarman attempts to discredit the use of the terms.

For example, if you are valuing a stock and come to a conclusion that the company is worth 2 billion, then if the stock drops to 1 billion or fluctuates lower doesnt mean it is more riskier because the stock price is fluctuating. The lower the stock drops below you 2 billion dollar valuation makes it a safer and not a riskier investment. This is of course if your valuation still stands at 2 billion. "

The current ratio should still give an idea of whether a company needs any cash shown on its balance sheet. In cases like you mention and the special cases like Walmart they seem to juggle current assets and liabilities very well with very low debt and cash balances. They wont usually have excess cash lying on the balance sheet as it negates the benefit of having good cash management and utilizing the revolver."

"
2014-07-14 22:45:11,"&gt;The answer is that companies cannot operate with zero cash. They will have suppliers that need to be paid and capital expenses that need large up front payments to name just two. 

Plenty of manufacturing and industrial firms operate with low/no cash balances, especially in this interest rate environment.  With interest rates as low as L+150-200bps on senior secured debt  for low-middle market companies (even for troubled/highly leveraged credits), companies can afford to carry no cash balances, use revolvers to pay for working capital, and pay almost no interest on the outstandings. I'm not saying carrying no cash on the b/s is the best possible strategy, but it's incredibly common and often times effective. "

&gt;In 2000, Julian Robertson's Tiger Management failed despite raising $6 billion in assets. A value investor, Robertson placed big bets on stocks through a strategy that involved buying what he believed to be the most promising stocks in the markets and short selling what he viewed as the worst stocks.

&gt;This strategy hit a brick wall during the bull market in technology.

Going against your instincts is not just hard, it's unnatural. It needs training, like a boxer needs to be trained to not look away from a punch. There will always be a place for this type of investing because of that.

I talk about my investments with other people in ""real life"", and I can tell the malaise they feel when I describe the companies I own, especially when I talk about why they're so cheap. And these are  ""wonderful, wonderful"" type businesses too, they just come with a few boo-boos.

2014-10-28 19:00:04,"with P*Q, many ways i suppose
quick and dirty would be to see if they give you Q i.e. chips sold and average selling price...else revenues / quantity sold
also, id look at capacity utilization and connect that to my capex...i thihnk it takes 2 years to build out capacity so in my model, if im hitting say, 80% utilization rate, spend 50% of capex in the subsequent year to increase capapcity and the balance in the following year

discount rates do matter
people try and use CAPM to figure it out....at my firm and personally we use 10%...why? because it's a hurdle rate, that my investment has to make at least 10%, if not more...this is a cyclical business too so thats why that number may make sense vs. something calculated like a 8%

i would  build a sensitivity table where in one variable is the wacc i.e. 8,9,10,11,12% and terminal growth varies from 0 to 4%

Mainstream value investing is buying growing companies and estimate earnings 'cheap'.  I've seen write-ups saying ""A DCF of the stock shows it's worth $80 and it trades for $70 giving us a margin of safety""  There is no margin of safety when estimating the future.."
2014-10-28 00:59:07,"Semiconductor stocks can often be quite cyclical, meaning the earnings can move around a fair bit year to year. If you're looking at a Price/Earnings ratio based on what's considered peak earnings, it'll be a low P/E, whereas if it's considered trough earnings, it'll be a high P/E.

If the trailing P/E is 3x the forward P/E, then earnings are expected to go up. I'd have a look at the history of past earnings (say 10 years) to get a feel for how cyclical earnings have been, then work out some reasons for why earnings are going up. If it is cyclical, perhaps work out what a normal level of earnings is and what multiple you should pay for that.

If it is or has been highly cyclical, constructing a DCF will likely be difficult to do. I'd probably simplify it and work out what you like about the company and where you think the stock will go in the next few years based on where you think earnings will go and how the market will value it.

Once you're done explaining your understanding of the company, you could try explaining what you think the market view of the stock is and what it's gotten wrong, which is creating the opportunity to buy here (assuming here that they're a fundamental firm and this is in line with their investment philosophy &amp; approach).

Good luck!

add depreciation which you can calculate as a percent of fixed assets


subtract capex which is a big deal for a semi company since its lumpy and big


calculate working capital as a percent of sales and subtract any increase year over year


that gets you free cash flow


discount it back and add all the discounted values to get firm value

2014-10-23 22:46:40,"I am starting to come around to being doubtful of valuation in investing like he regards in his video. 

Something what kills me is we use all these models, ""CAPM"" (which got broken during the financial crisis... and tries to make risk and variance equal...), assumptions of terminal growth, assumptions of capital structure, assumptions about all these things. And it kind of becomes a paradox. We are told ""don't be market timers, you can't predict the stock market in XXX years"" yet we try to justify that we can reasonably predict the value of a company in X years, based on these inputs. These inputs change, and our honest understanding of the company changes over time as the business it operates in, the capital structure, the business operations that it conducts, marketing you have it, all are HUGE factors of uncertainty that are made by management. 

And if there seems to be one theme with humans and stock markets, is that we are exuberant at times, and pessimistic at times, and our emotions speak a lot louder than logic in our views of the world, and this shapes our perceived values on companies we own etc. But why does this not apply to management as well? How can we be certain that somehow the management of this company is a stalwart logic wizard overlord, and not some emotional fallible human just like us?
These super uncertainties are so huge that all our wildest valuation assumptions sometimes just won't ever really capture the real economic value of the company looking forward, and this skews valuations. 

Not saying that valuation is completely worthless, it just is to show that valuation is not perfect. It is not the perfect beacon in the darkness, but rather a lamp in the darkness that still can be threatened by the winds of uncertainty. And another really useful tool is constantly updating your valuation, but the problem is like the elusive black swan, what really seems to matter the most we won't ever see coming.

rant over. Excuse me its a rather rash outburst but margin of safety is a really important concept, and no matter what you do in your valuation slapping a nice discount to be extra sure doesn't seem too bad to me."

2014-10-22 16:12:02,"US GAAP requires a reporting company to record the impact of foreign currency transactions (income statement effects) and the impact of the translation of the value of assets and liabilities (balance sheet effects) held in consolidated subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the reporting currency of the parent.  For instance, a US company with a Canadian subsidiary will convert the revenues (transactions) using the weighted average USD:CAD exchange rate during the period, and the value of fixed assets such as buildings will be translated from CAD to USD using the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the period.  Transaction effects generally flow through he income statement while translation effects usually bypass the income statement and go into AOCI until the asset or liability is sold or extinguished with any previously recorded translation gain or loss then reversing out of AOCI and the realized gain or loss recorded in the income statement.

There's also special accounting rules for highly inflationary environments.  Probably the best thing to do would be to pick up an advanced accounting book that covers foreign currency issues (look for a used one on Amazon, you should be able to get one for ~$10-20) and read about it and go through some examples. I believe IFRS also use similar rules for foreign currencies, but I'm not certain of the differences. 

All that is to say that proper financial accounting under US GAAP or IFRS should take into account the impact of foreign currencies, but like anything else, the value of the underlying business will be subjective based on your own assumptions about the future of the business (and now also the exchange rates!)."
2014-10-22 15:12:49,"While I haven't dealt too much with these, I would take a step back and ask yourself what you value it at as an investor who owned the firm and could never sell again.

With this, we might take a 20 year approach to owning to estimate a value. If we think the LC is going to lose value relative to the USD until it's worthless, that's one thing, but if it's not going to have that issue indefinitely, then I'll figure that it will balance out over time, and while there will be some good years, there will also be some bad years, and that's like owning any asset in general, even farm land has good/bad years.

In addition, I would ask if they're simply reporting in USD or actually converting back to USD at some point.

2014-10-21 22:31:53,"What I am writing is not fact and is merely my opinion from the reading I've done, but I think it makes sense:

HAL is one of the bigger producers. What many oil speculators thought at first was that OPEC and all the E&amp;P firms would cut back on production, thus tightening supply and by default increasing the price of crude.

However, the larger integrated firms (namely XOM because its not in Europe where everything got smacked) are not cutting back production. The reason is simple: they have enough capital to fall back on that they can take a loss on crude oil sales while the other companies that really got hit (for example DVN) do not have enough size to maintain production and continue risky shale plays at a loss.

In essence, the bigger oil firms just have enough money, that while other companies scale back production because it is not profitable or unsustainable for them, the larger firms use it as an opportunity to gain more market share and write down those contracts.

2014-10-19 09:54:47,"It is true that in theory NAV should be a reflection of the discounted cash flows an owner would generate from the assets.  The issue of using NAV vs DCF arises when an analyst looks at the financial statements and determines two identical assets are producing entirely different levels of cash flows.

For real estate, as an example, two buildings that are identical in every way other than the fact that one is on the east side of the street and the other and the west can, at any time, produce different levels of cash flows.  The reason why could result from the primary tenant, that had been on a 5 year lease, moving out and being replaced by another at a rental rate significantly higher than the previous tenant. The reason for the increase is due to the cities maturity and increased population locally.  The other building signed a 6 year lease and has yet to renegotiate its rental rate.  Using a calculation for NAV attempts to capitalize the rental rate based on the value of other assets that are similar (providing some adjustment for these differences).  

Alternatively, one owner may simply be a better operator than another. As a result, their expenses are lower and cash flows higher.  

Another issue can arise from the ownership of certain securities being marked at cost vs market value. This has become less of an issue under IFRS but can still emerge under certain circumstances of US GAAP.

Finally, capital structure can differ materially from one business to another.  This can directly alter the cost of capital and in turn the DCF value of the firm. That fact, however, doesn't mean the asset itself is worth more or less intrinsically.

Using NAV adjusts for these differences and provides investors a better understanding of the potential value of firm owning the assets. When the firm trades well below its NAV it is likely due to the fact management is destroying value at the firm level.  A better operator may choose to purchase these assets by buying the firm knowing it can improve operations.

2 - The value of the new issue stock should be close to the market value of the stock, assuming that it is a public company. 
3 - Even if it is a non cash expense, it may be still treated as a tax deduction line item, using the aggregate value of stock issued to fund 401k matches.

Both managers are very good but just be clear about what is happening...they have huuuge resources. Herbalife research, coincidentally, done by author of Confidence Game at $10k/week.

This is kind of the opposite point to the one I made above but the point is that business is simple but you need to understand what you are good at and how to get paid for it. In the example of CP, Ackman had hired bankers who knew the industry/people, he had the resources to attract those people, and he had the resources to pull off a successful campaign. I am sure everyone knew CP was underperforming but only Ackman can turn this into money. Another example, irl this time, I know a firm that doesn't do models or actually look at financials closely at all (seriously) but has one of the best records in EM markets anywhere. They do well because they meet a lot of companies, talk to a lot of people, and just focus on finding managers/owners who they like. 

The point is that what Ackman does isn't confusing, investing is very very simple in terms of knowledge and the concepts, but you need to work out where you can thrive. Having the resources to finance lots of man hours of research or meetings with managers is a very big advantage. So they do the same stuff as you just in volume that would blow your mind. If you don't have the resources, you need to work around.

If they're dependent on a specific operator, or if a few companies operate the majority of their assets, it might be a good idea to analyze the operators breakeven costs.. maybe a stacked bar chart w/ LOE + Production Costs + SG&amp;A + Interest. Basically making sure that they've partnered with the right people, and their partners will be able to keep drilling.

I can't think of any must-haves, but just a couple other factors you might consider: transportation agreements, commodity price (hedging) and interest rate volatility (floating debt?), reserve replacement cost, and capital structure (is growth through debt sustainable?)."

2015-02-01 03:29:19,"If there's any variation in the play ([first map on this page](http://www.investingdaily.com/15145/marcellus-shale-map-an-investors-introduction-to-the-marcellus-and-utica-shale-formations/)), the MLP is more likely to be in the predictable, low decline area. They won't be drilling any monster fracks, but they may buy some shallower wells nearby. They'd have lower decline rates for a couple reasons, but primarily because they want predictable cash flows that they can grow over time without requiring huge amounts of capex. Mature assets in a well understood play with a long history of production will provide this level of predictability. They're much less likely to be wildcatting or trying to hit new plays. 

I'd take a good look at the low PDP/PR MLP to figure out why that is. Do they have a GP that's planning to drop down major assets? Are there substantial PDNP's just waiting to come online? Have they historically had that low of PDPs, or is it due to uneconomic revisions?

Feel free to PM me if you have more specific questions. "

The competition is for the CFA IRC, a competition hosted by CFA society. (so kinda academic)

Just a few questions why would they have lower decline rates? I thought the decline in plays affect all wells equally and unless I don't understand how their ownership in a play operates I don't see why this would be different.

Regarding what ""should happen"" in the MLPs, one LP seemed to have a significantly higher PDP/PR while the other had the lowest in the comp set."

If you're trying to show that X company is a better operator than Y, or Y is undervalued relative to X and Z, then you have a lot more to consider than just total proved reserves. In reality, you have a lot more to consider than total proved reserves in damn near any scenario. 

The structural differences absolutely matter for valuation though.  MLP's are income-oriented equities, and their value is derived almost solely from distribution size, stability and growth.  Not to say dividends are unimportant for E&amp;P corps, but more factors are taken into consideration than just current yields. They'll also trade differently depending on their strategy, is a GP developing &amp; dropping down assets or are they going through the A&amp;D market funded with frequent issuances? 

Even the assets for an MLP are typically different. Given the same region/play, the MLP will (or should) have a higher PDP component,  lower decline rates, higher Reserves / Production ratio, lower maintenance capex, and a more consistent hedging program."

""all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and the community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us and where we see great momentum. That -- what I wanted to make sure is that our investors continue to understand that we will push for growth but in a disciplined matter. And if things don't materialize in the way that you don't hit your hurdles, you don't hit your timing, right, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don't have expenses ahead of the curve and we continue to monitor it quite closely. So in that sense, if we see conditions change, it's really important that you have the confidence that when we manage these investments, we do it in a prudent manner, right, optimistic but with -- there's always a dose of circumspection to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these rollouts. And that's what I really want to kind of communicate and signal to the Street, which is it's a balance. It's always about a balance. But given our situation, given all of the results that we've had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth in our sites, if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the business, growing 18% year-over-year despite all of the FX headwinds, right, it just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to invest smartly in the way we do. But I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in a smart way and in a disciplined manner. We're driving for to make sure we don't waste our shareholders' money."" - Patrick Pichette, Google CFO"

This spinoff speaks to me in two ways

1. It is a solid move. And that she spent as much time as she did was again reasonable that she focused 80% of her time on what is in essence 80% of her company at this point.

2. However, it speaks to me of two others issues; a) Why execute as many acquisition as she did if her focus was on unlocking the value of Alibaba. Most of the start-ups she bought would have still been there at similar values if she had waited until it had her full focus. I think this was a case of multi-tasking when she should have said ""no"" and focused all her M&amp;A energy on this. b) 2 years is too long for a deal like this. At what point did the marginal benefit dip below the marginal cost of the financial costs (lawyers and IBs) and the resource consumption of her and her team. 

The right move overall, but I'm not a fan of the operations left at Yahoo! at this point."

The process consumed almost her entire first two years at the company and required a small army of bankers and lawyers, she said.

&gt; “We homed in on the spinoff structure over the summer and we basically spent the fall really refining it,” Ms. Mayer said. “There were a lot of variations on the way to do the spin, what was included in the spin, was it a reverse spin or a straightforward spin, which is what we ultimately chose.”

2013-04-06 12:51:29,Great piece!
2013-04-06 11:27:43,"If your research is correct it seems like a compelling thesis. The risks of shorting are much more variable than those of buying however. Commonly the most important question with short pitches, after triple-checking research, is the time of realization. How long will it take for the market to reflect these unsustainable and crooked business practices in the share price? It seems like the market needs a catalyst to realize how poorly the company is run. What event could provide that? How much are you willing to pay to borrow the stock in the meantime (if you're shorting cash outright)? What's the likelihood of a price spike and getting a margin call (if you short outright)? Remember that there's an opportunity cost to the cash you put up as margin. How much are you willing to pay in theta (if you're shorting with puts)?"
2013-04-06 10:58:07,"The obsession with P/E in the modern era of ""value investing"" is absurd. It is incredibly easy to manipulate earnings, especially amongst financial companies (and financials comprise over 20% of the S&amp;P, by far the largest sector representation - highly relevant to this study). Investing in single names based on P/E is naive; market timing and forecasting an entire index based on P/E is equally silly.

Look to book value, fcf yield, ROIC&gt;WACC with appropriate capex. P/E is not a trusted or meaningful indicator to intelligent/conservative investors"
2013-04-06 00:16:52,"Yeah tough choice. Some of the people on this subreddit are real pro analysts, so they are use to a thinking pattern that to be honest is the correct way to analyze a complete company. A lot of the legendary investors have their own opinions of 100+ page reports as garbage and would prefer a simplistic report of investing which is what you are proclaiming, but all of them want a distinct reason for investment. It could be long and complex or short and concise. 20 pages is actually not that long. 

This is a value investing community and value investing is all about finding a reason for undervaluation and then a margin of safety from your valuation. If a company doesn't past your business valuation filter then you got to keep it in your pocket until it drops to the price you are willing to buy or sell at a hefty discount (your margin of safety 10, 20, 30, 40 , 50% etc). All companies are a buy/sell/hold at a given price. 

I'm not a ""pro"" because unfortunately I have other responsibilities that need to be taken care of first due to family obligations, but likewise I am a business owner with not a lot of time such as yourself (time wise at least). Thus, I have chosen to study first by reading prominent books and taking classes that fit my schedule (6-9pm) classes. Currently I'm taking financial statement analysis. I'm probably not going to be able to enter the investment field due to my age (26) and some disheartening truths such as ""networking"" to land a job in the field, but I want to educate myself on something I am passionate about and that passion is investing. I'm not ""wasting"" time when I don't find a company I want to invest into. I'm gaining experience and moreover the company has been analyzed and I have a buy/sell/hold number in my pocket from the analysis. You must have the heart to say ""no"" more than you say ""yes"" because not everything will be a screaming buy. This process is grueling, but its pretty cool when you come up with a number and then throw some money around or see if you were wrong or right on your analysis. I have been wrong and right haha, but in my defense the time when I was wrong it was complete BULLSHIT. Auditors lied.

The side bar has a book list that's really good. I would start with ""the intelligent investor"" by Graham. It will give you an idea of what is going on here - a nice stepping stone. "
2013-04-05 11:47:57,"&gt;The problem is, what if I spend 2 weeks on a company and it turns out it's not good?

Then you don't buy stock in that company.

&gt;And then I find another and spend additional 2 weeks, and that one isn't good either. What if I spend a whole year and don't find any good companies?

Then don't buy stock in those companies either.  As you develop your investment process, you should be able to filter out potential investments relatively quickly. You'll only dive deeper and deeper into a company if what you continue to see is compelling. This will cause you to miss opportunities, but there are no called strikes in the game of investing. The objective of investing is to not lose money, so you have to be very diligent in order to do so. It's easy to get average returns (index funds) and very difficult to get above average returns.

To give you an idea, I'm usually only able to come up with one good investment idea every quarter that is unique to me. I can usually source an additional good investment idea that I understand from investors' pitches and portfolios every quarter. 

That makes 8 ideas a year and that is plenty. Most of those ideas don't end up into my portfolio as my turnover is somewhere below 50%. The only reason I continue to do this is because it is fun for me and I want to see how much I can beat the index by over a 10 year period. If you don't enjoy the process and just want to make money you should index.

2013-04-05 03:33:00,"Right, so I've spent around 2 days on analyzing Lanxess, perhaps a bit more. I've also searched google for all kinds of news and opinions about the company, even in German.

The problem is, what if I spend 2 weeks on a company and it turns out it's not good? And then I find another and spend additional 2 weeks, and that one isn't good either. What if I spend a whole year and don't find any good companies? I can understand that investment companies with hundreds of analysts can afford to spend 2 weeks on analyzing a single paper, but surely individual investors can't work like that. Not to mention that I don't have 8h/day, only the weekends, to do this kind of analysis."
2013-04-05 02:46:28,"To give you an idea, I took a business valuation course to test what I have learned from Graham, Lynch, Fisher and Buffet. I randomly selected a  company and pooped out a 20 page report after 10 weeks of learning/studying. 

My professor was once the #1 ranked analyst in his industry of paper, but left due to moral duty and said the term paper I wrote was nearly perfect. All I had to do was move one paragraph in the introduction from the bottom to the top; this was more of a writing problem, but the analysis was dead on. It took me a 2 weeks to write it leisurely and would probably take 4-5 days of hard work 9-5ish style to produce that baby.

A lot of work goes into coming with an ultimate decision of buy sell or hold.

2013-04-05 02:29:36,"I think most simple predictive growth models tend to have a simple function of:

capital appreciation % + dividend return % +...X+...Z

of course they are using back history to come up with these numbers.

OP is using the shiller model with the formula of 6% for capital appreciation + shiller p/e + dividend yield + some weird math number that probably is valid.

I agree with you that the dividend yield should already be factored into the price similarly to the 6% back tested average historic growth because there should be some average dividend yield, but I think this model chooses to seperate the two components like most others allowing the user to have some choice into current yields. 

Greenbackd should have a much better idea about this. Also, you could be correct with a better model factoring in future dividend growth rates similar to capital appreciation growth rates. "

2013-04-04 05:16:08,"Bayer is the type of company that would be hard to figure out with a value investor's conservative principles. The problem with Bayer ( I think its a pharm company) is that they have to do an ""s"" curve continuous growth since their patents on hit drugs will only last so many given years. 

most likely the stock went up due to expectations of a new drugs coming out of the pipeline, but yeah that's speculating. 

Personally, I have found that the market picks up undervaluations pretty quick on some of the stocks that would be ""popular"" choices in front of the masses. On some others that are ""dull"" businesses it might take a while. For example, Corning. Boring business. Undervalued. Going to take forever for the market to realize this, but yes it is undervalued using Graham's methods. 

Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, Graham are the key investor philosophys' that I follow. Take a look at their books when you have time since you can't take a financial accounting course or econ/business. (note Buffett has none, but he has many many videos and letters). In fact, although I think academics taught me a lot, books from my 4 core investors have really been the cherry on top. Shoot I read B Graham's accounting book haha just remembered that. That thing is only 100 pages and does a good job.

2013-04-03 19:54:27,"The purpose of those questions is to make sure you understand the business and you can make an intelligent decision on whether to buy or not buy Lanxess.

You will not be able to answer all of these questions, but these are the things you should be thinking about when you make investment decisions.  Fundamental analysis goes much further beyond ratios and figures a company's 3 main financial statements. You should understand how the industries in its segments operate and the major events that have happened over the past business cycle. You should definitely understand the how each of this company's segments make money and the competitive landscape in these segments. You should understand the strategy that management is pursuing and know whether they are good or bad at capital allocation.  

All these factors inform the assumptions you make when valuing a company. Using numbers or formulas alone without underlying basis to come to an estimate of intrinsic value is wrong.  If you're not able to do these things then you'll find it very hard to make buy/sell decisions.
"
2013-04-03 17:13:12,"&gt; I... why do I need to answer all those questions? 

Because if investing was easy we'd all be rich and laughing to the bank, you want good returns then be prepared to put in the work to achieve them. If you can't be bothered to figure out their cost structure in relation to close and similar competitors then why even bother looking at the company.

Edit: You have to remember that it's the underlying business you are paying for and that is why it's important to have answers to those questions."
2013-04-03 17:03:39,"I... why do I need to answer all those questions? I really appreciate your post and will try and answer all that during the weekend, but what is the purpose of all those questions? For example, what if I discover that Lanxess' cost structure is not as good as its competitors, should I not buy then? I don't think there are *any* companies out there that could answer positively to all those questions, this is why we have competition, cause one company is better in something than another, but not in everything.

&gt; Is the capital structure sustainable in the face of continued economic weakness in the EU?

It's been growing ever since the company was established, it had a positive year even in 2008 and had a steady growth ever since. Last year they were admitted into the DAX index. I think they're one of the few success stories of Europe."
2013-04-03 10:46:32,"You should look at share repurchases as capital allocation decisions like other outlays of cash. As such stock should only be repurchased when the company is undervalued.

Even though discussion revolved around this, looking at EPS accretion alone is a mistake when evaluating buybacks. An increase in EPS will only increase value if P/E multiples are constant or continuously increasing. We know that is not the case.

Most CEO's don't have the confidence to buyback shares when companies are clearly undervalued as the economy is usually in the shitter. We'll see in the long term how wise this transaction was."
2013-04-03 10:20:52,"I don't think you were going to get a response from people here either. I respond to posts like these from time to time as it looks like you are trying to learn. My response is long.

What you posted above does not examine the underlying business of Lanxess and does not pose a clear thesis to why this stock is undervalued.

I'm not sure you understand how many assumptions you're making in your statements above and how much key information about this company you've omitted. Additionally, many of the reasons you provide to prove this stock is cheap actually do the opposite. Let me go through some of your statements to show you what I mean:

&gt;Lanxess is a chemical company that produces all kinds of chemicals.

What type of chemicals does Lanxess produce? What feedstock do they use to produce these chemicals? What markets do they sell these chemicals into? What does the competitive landscape look like in these markets? How profitable are each of these chemicals? What countries do they sell these chemicals into?

&gt; Last year they invested a lot in producing tires. 

Have they always produced tires? How much did they invest in producing tires? What did they do with the money; expand existing capacity or build new plants? How much revenue comes from making tires? What are their Gross and Operating Margins in this segment?


&gt;They made two acquisitions (small companies) and they both were somewhat related to the auto industry. 

What business were these acquisitions in? How much should they contribute to Lanxess in terms of revenue and earnings? How much did Lanxess pay for these businesses? Was is smart that Lanxess bought these businesses? Does Lanxess have a history of making good or bad acquisitions?

&gt;In their annual report last week they said they had worse than expected sales due to low demand from car manufacturers, for example their tire sales went down 40%.

Are most of their customers in Europe? What is your position on where Europe is in the business cycle? What are their contracts like with these customers? Who is their competition for these customers? What is Lanxess' cost structure compared to those competitors? I would expect manufacturers with operations in the US to have lower costs in the US due to structurally lower energy costs. Do US manufacturers ship tires to Europe? What marketshare does Lanxess have in all of their markets?

&gt;It's P/E went from 10.01 to 8.95 so now it's cheap (or in decline)

Just because the P/E is low doesn't mean that the business is in decline or that its cheap. Moreover, a 10% change in P/E multiple isn't an enormous move. Cyclical companies can trade at very low P/E multiples when earnings are high in the latter portion of the business cycle.  Where do you think we are in the business cycle? What are the 10 year normalized earnings/FCF for Lanxess? What are the average EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, EV/FCF, and P/E for Lanxess over the business cycle?

&gt;Their profit for 2012 (=514) was record high and higher than in 2011 (=506), the problem is that it was expected they would earn more. Still, the fact that they've never been as profitable as they are now should be a good sign.

Profits reaching record highs should be expected in all companies at some point. Moreover, this should be expected in cyclical companies at the later stages of the business cycle. This is not as important as you think it is.

&gt;Their ROA and ROE is lower than in 2011 but only by a bit, and is higher than in 2010. So if it wasn't for the poor sales, I'd say they're getting more efficient.

What evidence do you have to say they're getting more efficient? Did capacity utilization at their plants increase? Did prices for their products get higher? Did costs get lower? Did they restructure in anyway?  There are many reasons why ROA and ROE can increase. You did not look at the underlying business so you have nothing to anchor this statement on.

&gt;The company was created as a spin-off from Bayer in 2005, and after going through a messy period they started giving out dividends in 2006 and never stopped. The dividend per share went up from 0.25 in 2006 to 1.00 euro this year

Is this dividend sustainable? What percentage of normalized FCF is this 1 euro dividend?

&gt;Their EPS is 113% higher than the average for the previous 5 years, and 2361% higher than in the period 2005-2009

2008-2009 was the bottom of the cycle so earnings should be negative here. You admitted that the company was a mess in 2005. 3 of the 5 years in your sample should be horrible.  Is it still impressive that earnings are up an absurd amount on a very low number? Is this growth coming from getting more customers? Is this coming from operational efficiency? Is this coming from a reversion to mean?

&gt;Profit/Debt is 31.5% for 2012 and has been steadily growing since 2006.

If profit/debt is growing the company is getting more levered. Is that a good thing for a cyclical company? How much debt can this business support? What is the capital structure of this company? Is the capital structure sustainable in the face of continued economic weakness in the EU? This could also be one of the reasons that ROE is increasing.

&gt;According to Graham's formula for determining the stock's intrinsic value, it's 53.52 EUR. Its current stock price now is 55.05 so it's pretty close, it's not overpriced

If what you're saying is true then the stock is overpriced as it's trading for more that the Graham formula. Moreover, you'd want the company to be trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value before you buy, not a premium.

&gt;ROIC is 5.89% which is ""just right"" (more than 6% would be ideal)

I'd like it alot more if the ROIC was 20%. Why is 5.89% just right? That return is too low to cover your cost of capital. Growing businesses whose return on capital is less than their cost of capital destroy value. What is the average ROIC for Lanxess over the past 10 years?


Pretty much none of what you posted makes me want to buy Lanxess or look at it further. I know that sounds harsh, but you have much more work to do before you have sufficient information to make an investment decision. Work on answering the questions posed and you'll have a much better understanding of the company and industry Lanxess sells into. Most of the time you look at companies and end up not finding anything. This may be one of those times. 

Repost your revised analysis after you have a more compelling thesis. We appreciate compelling ideas and want to keep the quality of posts in this sub as high as possible."
2013-04-03 09:21:24,"Thanks everyone for your input, I've enjoyed reading the different opinions.  From what has been discussed here there seems to be two ways to look at this.

It really depends on how you look at the stock.

EV/EBITDA is good for retailers in general, but Home Depot is huge, and it isn't going private any time soon, so an unlevered multiple isn't necessarily the best way to value it. I'd favor EV/EBITDA if I felt that:

1) HD was a takeover candidate

2) HD was underlevered, and could do a larger dividend recapitalization or levered repurchase to boost shareholder value.

I don't think HD is a takeover candidate, nor do I think it's a poor allocator in need of an activist to encourage it to make better use of capital. In fact, HD has been one of the best companies at returning shareholder cash to its owners. So EV/EBITDA, for me, would be out for HD. I'd instead do a DCF analysis and go from there. DCF because it would be a buy and hold stock. I like EV/EBITDA more for event-driven, M&amp;A plays."

This isn't true as far as I know. Choosing exactly ten years (which, admittedly, sounds like an arbitrary, nice round number) of earnings gives the highest predicting power over the next years' market return. The study that shows that is available online, I think somewhere in the ""vanguard"" website.

Apart from that, IMO, you should do any juggling at all with a measure that is intrinsecally inaccurate because you would be defeating its usefulness. Women didn't incorporate to the job market until 50? years ago and you could produce a myriad of caveats more. What is sure in any case is that the US won't be growing at 3%.

2013-04-02 14:24:08,"Ive been long hd since 2009.  If issuing debt to buy back stock is so brilliant then why didnt they do it when the stock was wildly undervalued?

A common street wide poor management decision is to lever up to buy back stock when your companies stock is at a high.  And halt buy backs when a stock is undervalued and has fallen a lot (to conserve capital).

This why its so easy to go to google and find numerous studies on how large companies are absolutely retarded when it comes to trading their own stock.

The fact that you just immeaditely dismiss my distaste for this kind of frequently stupid decision making because you think i dont know it raises eps shows me all i need to know about your ability to see the bigger picture.  Or inability i should say."

2013-04-02 13:47:14,"First, let me admit that I don't follow HD that closely. That said, like most retailers, HD generates more in free cash flow than it generates in GAAP earnings - $5.6 billion in FCF vs $4.5 billion in earnings in 2012. So P/E isn't necessarily the best way to look at their earnings power.

Also, Home Depot's forward earnings projections (yeah, yeah, I know, forward earnings...) are much higher. HD trades at about 17x forward estimates.

Earnings can grow. Home Depots earnings are growing. So, over time, the spread between the rate paid on its debt and the earnings yield should also grow, enriching shareholders.

Home Depot is issuing debt really cheap. From your article: 

&gt;$1 billion of securities due 2023 that may yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal amount of 30-year debt that may pay a spread of 110 basis points.

HD's debt will cost the company something like 2.70% for the 10 year issues and 4.1% over 30 years. Any way you slice it, shareholders are winning here.

Issuing debt to repurchase shares is relatively common. The cost of debt is much cheaper than the cost of equity. Therefore, investors win when the company is levered to increase returns to equity investors.

Think about it this way: why would anyone buy a rental house with 90% debt and 10% down when they could just buy it with cash? Leverage, and higher returns."

2013-04-01 11:09:57,"I'd second the person that recommended you buy an accounting book or take an intro course, it's helpful to buckle down the basics on this stuff.

Book value is simply: Total assets - total liabilities - preferred stock.

Book value is what's left over for shareholders, so net assets and liabilites and what ever is left is equity.

FCF, the absolute best way is CFO (with averaged working capital changes) - maint capex

I'm not sure what you're going with on the stability.  If a company has consistent EPS does that mean they're better than something where they're changing?

2013-04-01 09:05:53,"&gt; Why is 18.74 wrong for 2010?

18.74 has to be wrong because pharma trades in the single digits to low doubles, an 18x multiple would be a massive outlier and I know Bayer isn't. 


Book value is the value at which they are carrying these things though, and depreciation and amortisation are not necessarily accurate measures of value decline. What matters for book value from a value investor perspective is how much these things are actually worth. Bayer's biggest assets are their patents; are they amortising these properly? Could they sell them tomorrow for their carrying value?

&gt; I'm not sure how it can be above 1

Market cap not price

&gt; I don't know, why is it bad?

EPS is bad because net income is notoriously easy to manipulate through accounting tricks. It can also be a problem because of stock splits, one-off adjustments, non-recurring charges, etc.

&gt; I've read somewhere that it's not really a very good metric 

That's just not true. It's an easy proxy for FCF, and is the *go to* valuation metric in most industries outside of FIG. If you ask a professional where a company is trading, the answer will almost certainly be given as an EV/EBITDA multiple.

&gt;  For example, Novartis has 14.2, so it's more overpriced than Bayer. However, I was told that EV/EBITDA should mostly be used for telecommunication or energy companies, so it shouldn't matter much for a pharmaceutical company.

Novartis isn't ""more overpriced"" than Bayer, it's a different company. They have Alcon! And you should *never* look at historical ratios, only forward ones; investors care about a company's future prospects, not what it did in the past. They don't have a claim to those earnings. 

And EV/EBITDA is huge for pharma!! Massively so!

&gt;I don't think that I should understand how an industry works in order to invest.

But you do. You don't need to know the details, but you need to know the basics, which you can get from an industry primer. You need to understand what drives growth and sales, and what matters for valuing companies in that industry. For instance, depreciation is much more important for industrials than it is for media.

&gt; Also their profitability, ROA and ROE are diminishing year on year since 2007. Like I said, I could've figured this out from the Excel sheet, instead of wasting a day on reading the report.

But *why*? They are diminishing *because* of patent cliffs. But just because they are diminishing doesn't mean it's a bad investment!! What matters is whether investors have over- or under-compensated for this.

And you don't need to read the whole AR. You should read ER on the company first though to try to understand what their challenges and strengths are."

2013-04-01 05:41:57,"Fair enough. I probably didn't explain what was the point of my original question. I asked only the stuff which I wasn't sure if I calculated right. For EV/EBITDA, I knew that I did it right since it's obvious how to calculate it. 

Why is 18.74 wrong for 2010? They had a low EBITDA and low profit, you can notice that immediately compared to the years before and after. At the same time their share price remained the same (see how even the P/E was exceptionally high). Note that I only took random share prices from July and December of 2010. It's possible that it went up and down a lot during that time, so maybe at one time they had a P/E of 5... I wouldn't know. But it doesn't really matter if you look at it long term.

&gt; why you would care about book value

Good question about the book value. I went back to make sure I got it right and noticed that from 2004 I got the depreciation wrong, I wrote positive instead of negative numbers.

Book value is what the company would be worth if it returned all its debt and then it sold all its physical assets like chairs and buildings. The intangible assets are not counted in since they cannot be sold at an auction.

I was asking about this formula because I wasn't sure if I got it right:

Book value = Total assets + Depreciation - Other current assets - Debt

* Depreciation is a negative value so I add it to Total assets instead of subtracting it.
* Other current assets is goodwill, which needs to be subtracted from the Total assets.

P/BV needs to be above 1, otherwise it's overpriced. However, I'm not sure if I got this value right. Price is, for example, $50, and Book value is 24 billion... I'm not sure how it can be above 1.

&gt; why EPS is actually a bad metric of earnings?

I don't know, why is it bad? Seems like a pretty good metric to see if their earnings are going up in a 10 year period.

&gt; Do you even know what EV or EBITDA are?

EBITDA is earning before income taxes and depreciation. It shows how much the company would've earned if it didn't have to pay taxes and had no capital expenditures. I've read somewhere that it's not really a very good metric because it's possible to have a positive EBITDA, but the profit can still be negative. The only thing important about it is that is should remain positive at all times, if it's negative then the company has some serious issues.

EV shows the market price of the company, in theory how much would someone have to pay in order to take over 100% of the company. It's shares * share price + debt - cash, which makes sense since you would have to buy all the shares at the current price, take on the company's debt as an added expense, but you would get the company's available cash so it's an income.

&gt; You didn't even mention EV/EBITDA, which is one of the key metrics

EV/EBITDA is something similar to the P/E ratio, it shows if the stock price is cheap or expensive compared to other companies. For example, Novartis has 14.2, so it's more overpriced than Bayer. However, I was told that EV/EBITDA should mostly be used for telecommunication or energy companies, so it shouldn't matter much for a pharmaceutical company.

&gt; Do you understand pharma?

I don't think that I should understand how an industry works in order to invest. What if I have shares of 20 different companies, all different from each other because of diversification? Should I learn everything there is to know about the textile industry, car manufacturing, spaceflight, etc. before I invest in any of those? That's not really possible...

&gt; Do you understand the basics of investing? 

I've read a few books and based on my investments so far I've made more money than lost. Some of this was only luck, which is why I'd like to learn more, hence this thread.

&gt; Do you understand the basics of accounting?

I think I should learn more, but what I know so far should already be enough to recognize when a company is overpriced or in serious trouble.

&gt; Can you tell me what a patent cliff is and why you should care?

It's when their patent expires and other generic drugs producers start making their drugs at a cheaper price, so they lose profit. I've read about this in the Novartis report. Like I said, I haven't gone into analyzing Bayer because I want to know from these numbers if I should waste my time at all. And the numbers tell me that I shouldn't. I did a similar thing with Novartis, made an Excel sheet like this, noticed that something is wrong, but decided to read their annual report anyway. After going through like 100 pages it turned out that they indeed have problems for 2013... for example, the case you mentioned. One of their competitors was not approved for a drug in 2012 so they made extra profit, but they're expecting to make extra losses if another competitor does get approved in February. And then I looked at the news and saw that indeed, the competitor's drug was approved.

Also their profitability, ROA and ROE are diminishing year on year since 2007. Like I said, I could've figured this out from the Excel sheet, instead of wasting a day on reading the report."
2013-03-31 22:20:01,"OK, I thought about answering your questions, but you really are not nearly sophisticated enough to be making investing decisions on your own yet. Here are two questions:

1) What is the point of this 10 year income statement? Do you understand *what* these various metrics show you? Can you explain to me *why* you would care about book value, *why* EPS is actually a bad metric of earnings? You didn't even mention EV/EBITDA, which is one of the *key* metrics, and I can tell you right now 18.74 has to be wrong for 2010. Do you even know what EV or EBITDA are?  
2) What do you think you will learn from the AR? ARs are sales documents; they contain legal disclosures and can provide useful info, but only if you know what you're looking for. Even if you aren't going to buy Bayer though, I'd read the AR. It is technically 200 pages, but a lot will be pictures, and you can scan the rest

Do you understand pharma? Do you understand the basics of investing? Do you understand the basics of accounting? Until you can answer these, you shouldn't be investing. Working through spreadsheets is great for learning, and asking questions is good, but you're asking all the *wrong* questions. You should *never* invest based on historical data, *especially* in pharma due to patent cliffs. Can you tell me what a patent cliff is and why you should care? Because everyone else who is trying to beat you at investing can. 10 hours a day is not nearly enough to say you can't learn this stuff.

I'm actually confident about most of the stuff I did here, I'm only not sure if I got the formula for the Book value right. I can't take an accounting course since I work 10h/day...

Anyway, before reading a 200 page annual report I think it's better first to just get the data for the past 10 years and if it looks all right then I'll read the report for 2012. For example, in the case of Bayer, I see that they don't have stable profit growth, their cash flow and profitability declined this year, while the stock price went up and now they have a P/E of 27.19, so I don't think I should read their full report cause I won't buy their stock."
2013-03-31 13:49:46,"Did you manually input the numbers into excel or is there some kind of command I'm missing out on?

1) right

2) kind of wrong, interest is an expense too as well as taxes. These other expenses should be included in analysis and expenses should be categorized to see where it is growing or shrinking.

4) I have seen different ways to calculate free cash flow, but take a look at the cash flow report or simply google free cash flow. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow ...as you can see multiple different forms.

...after reading your other questions I think you should just take a financial accounting course. It's an easy class and quite useful in almost eveyrthing you do.

"
2013-10-15 05:50:56,"I'm not sure where the 8% is from, probably a small premium over what is the historical norm for lower rated debt.

I think Greenwald says that VC investors require 15%, so that's his upper bound.

But the point is, you're never going to guess at cost of equity to compute intrinsic value for a franchise company.  There you're going to use r = E/P + g to see what return you think you'll get at today's price (think IRR instead of NPV)

The only time you'd compute intrinsic value is for a non-franchise company, where (according to Greenwald) growth is worth nothing.  So intrinsic value reduces to just P = E / r.  Here if your estimate of r turns out to be a little off, it doesn't cause the valuation to swing as wildly.

And Greenwald would add that to check whether you did it right, you'd also compute an asset replacement value (ARV).  Those two valuations: the earnings power value (EPV) from the income statement, and the ARV primarily from the balance sheet, allow you to triangulate on the true value.

If they're significantly different, double-check your math and assumptions.  If they're STILL significantly different, you've either found a franchise (EPV&gt;ARV) or a case where value can be unlocked if poor mgmt is removed or a bad business segment is shut down (EPV&lt;ARV).


"
2013-10-15 05:16:19,"and it gets worse.  you also have the problem of what to use for the market risk premium.  if you're familiar with the literature (which I'm not, very) the estimate of what it is evidently ranges from 4%-10%. 

so if Rf=0%, maybe COE = 1.5 x 10% = 15%
or maybe COE = 0.5 x 4% = 2%  !

if you want to use CAPM though, there is a way to reduce your confidence interval on what beta is, and that is to use the beta for the industry instead. the averaging over multiple companies reduces the standard error.  damodaran suggests doing this and has a page where he maintains the industry betas.  note that you have to take this unlevered average and adjust for the leverage of the individual company.

2013-10-15 02:07:03,"I know everyone is going to poke fun at Fama and the EMH, but it's sad that Hansen's contributions are largely being ignored because they're difficult for a layperson to understand.

Even if we ignore all of his other work, Hansen's 1982 (Hansen, Singleton 1982) statistical model, GMoM, is actually a very, very useful tool for investors. If anything, it's one of the best statistical tools for quantitative financial analysis because it uses as few 'silly' assumptions as possible while still being consistent and unbiased. Furthermore, GMoM can have as many equations in the system as needed, and it can even be used on non-linear systems. Most (if not all), types of regression analysis can actually be defined as special cases of GMoM."

Every other variable can be logically estimated by drawing on historical data and making small subjective adjustments.

It seems far too arbitrary for my liking tbh... Where does 8-15% come from? 

The only thing I can say with certainty is that the RR should be higher than YTM, which is a real pity because the Gordon growth model is pretty neat, provided the inputs are sound. If i plug in some arbitrary coc, which may very well be rubbish, I get a rubbish valuation."

2013-10-14 14:56:27,"it's a form of the dividend discount model or gordon growth model.  but greenwald is saying rather than using:

P = E / (r - g)

or 

P/E = 1 / (r - g)

with some algebra you can re-arrange this to:

r = E/P + g

the dividend plus buyback ""cash yield"" is the first part of the equation.  you can still guess at g if you like, but you don't end up with the phenomenon of the correct P (intrinsic value) jumping all over the place with slight changes in your guesses at r and g, if you use that bottom equation to compute your expected return instead."

2013-10-14 14:42:08,"i think greenwald usually says the following:

(1) cost of debt is often obvious, just look at the YTM on their bonds.  that also gives you a lower bound for the cost of equity.

(2) forget using beta to estimate cost of equity. the standard error on the regression is usually so large as to make the estimate unusable (e.g. beta=1.0 plus or minus 0.5).  but their cost of equity is going to be somewhere between 8-15%.  for a large, low-risk firm 8-9%.  for a small, high-risk firm 14-15%.  you really have to familiarize yourself with the company and - gasp - use your judgement. 

and of course cost of capital is the weighted average of the two."
2013-10-14 13:46:00,"Presented with such cases, one would typically take a two step approach for calculating PV of inflows: the first half being for the periods where growth outpaces coc and the second half for the periods in which growth peters off to a normalised rate, allowing the series to converge into a finite point (g under coc). Sum total of both stages would then be finite.

Eliminating the need to pay rent yourself or generating income by renting out real estate can should drastically alter its ""real return"".

2013-10-06 02:27:16,"Imo, one of the more discernible changes we're seeing from ACA is the shift from a supply model that is vendor/rep focused to one that is direct and nationalized. The days are dwindling for a model where a doc buys $1000 orthopedic screws from a hot little sales rep who takes him out to steak dinner. It's crazy that a sales rep makes more for watching a surgery than the MD actually doing it, and MD's are catching onto this. Hospitals are making spending transparent on a physician level, a la peer pressure. Used to be that a doc gets paid for every little thing he does; now he'll (ideally) be getting paid for every little thing he can avoid needing to order. For the first time in HC, physicians are incentivized to be cost cutters.

Hospitals are looking at where the $'s are funneling, and starting with the big spenders. Radiology and medical devices are definitely on the radar.  Wright Direct is something to watch unfold.  Diagnostic labs: will hospitals outreach for more in-house and catch more reimbursement arb?

I've been following ALOG, which does ultrasound, sells to MRI/CT OEMs, and sells to CT airport baggage checks.  They're interesting because they've been toying with the idea of going direct with MRI/CT and competing with the GE's of the world; this is not the right time to do this. I'm wondering if they're being forced to do this due to a push out from the OEMs.  They also sell ultrasound direct (including a recent acquisition). These guys are small and they're not going to be able to scale to Siemen-level margins when sales start to get pressured.  These machines are expensive, and hospitals want to cut costs here. Note that it is hard to measure the upside risk from their airport baggage CT scanners, which they claim is a near-term grower."

2013-10-04 15:46:56,"&gt;""What makes the current episode so difficult to understand for most investors is the atypical nature of
the processes employed to remediate a once-in-a-lifetime balance sheet recession. Prices are not being driven
upward by a highly visible speculative frenzy triggered by remarkable technological innovation, but by concerned investors desperate for any return on their money. Mainstream economists, who focus on the nation’s income statement, are hard-pressed to opine intelligently on what is a balance sheet phenomen on. Analogous to trying to quench an oil fire with water, central bankers around the world are fighting a solvency crisis with liquidity...

&gt; ...The “imperious immediacy of interest,” the intense desire for the intended consequences of one’s actions, tends to blind the policymaker to the unintended consequences of those same actions. The experiment of driving the cost of money to zero has caused huge price distortions and led to massive malinvestment, to which most investors appear oblivious

To which:

&gt; Envision cash as an option that can be valued. Think of it as a call option on any asset, with no expiration date, and with no strike price. As long as you’re holding cash – liquidity – the world of future investment opportunities, wherever and whenever they might appear, is your oyster.

As a new student of investing and markets, this is fascinating stuff to me. I have not been able to make any sense of things lately. Theories akin to this seem to explain what is happening right now so beautifully.

The question is, where do I go from here? Although ""conventional"" wisdom seems to be screaming to buy buy buy securities (""stay in the market because you don't want to miss out on any gain!!!!!!""), I have realized quite a lot of gains since 2007-ish. If stocks are fundamentally over-valued and over-hyped right now, interest rates are close to zero, and gold is... well I have no clue about gold, then doesn't it seem prudent to sell securities and realize some gains from the past 5-6 year run? A pool of cash right now while values are high seems like a value-minded course of action.

Notice I haven't mentioned a coming crash or a downturn or any of that. Just simply that stocks are over valued presently which makes them an insecure investment from a value standpoint.

I feel its related to the Book Antifragile (by N. Taleb)? He proposes heuristics to handle disequilibrium / complex systems like economies. Where as the articles propose (physic-related) economic models to derive policies for economies (even if model assumptios are false).

I have written a software for computational fluid dynamics (is related to plasma fluid simulations; I had heavy support from Phds). One thing I got from this nerd stuff is, that if model parameter are not fine tuned, the simulations explode (very narrow parameter ranges) and if the model geometry changes minimally, the simulation result could differ extremly from the previous simulations (butterfly effect). 
I concluded, that it is awesome for machinaries optimization, but too instable for economic models (because the model and its parameter are to volatile and therefore the model can justify every economic policy)."

For 2013 and 2012, Capital Corporation’s ratios were 3.04 to 1 and 2.30 to 1, respectively, and never less than 2.75 to 1 and 2.02 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement in 2013 or 2012.

I'm coming to think the financial services shouldn't be a reason to avoid Deere - and that a Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation should really turn on the prospects and finances of the equipment operations. Since almost all the profits of financial services are the result of sales by equipment operations, I'm not sure it's wrong to think of the financial services as simply increased margin for equipment ops (balance sheet considerations excluded).

2014-01-08 15:48:33,"The financial services operating earnings include interest expense and foreign currency gains/losses - the numbers are directly from the 10-K pages 24 and 25, and I took them without adjustment.

2014-01-08 15:12:08,Agree: Corn is especially susceptible. I wonder what the crop distribution is for Deere though: how much of Deere's revenue/profit comes from Corn farmers as opposed to crops that are less likely to fall in price in the coming years...I'll try to see if there is data on this.
2014-01-08 14:00:33,"Helpful to have a sense of size of the various units. Based on 2013 Operating Profit, the business is 85% Equipment Ops, and 15% Financial Services. They sometimes break out Equipment Ops into Agriculture/Turf and Construction/Forestry, so:

Ag &amp; Turf: 79%  
Construction &amp; Forestry: 6%  
Financial Services: 15%  

Though of course the balance sheet for Financial Services is significantly larger.

Also geographically, helpful to keep in mind that equipment sales are 80% US/Canada, and 20% rest of world. So despite their many tentacles, Deere's results are still driven by sales to the American farmer."

1. Equipment operations (bread and butter of the business) 
2. Financial services (equipment leasing/financing, etc)

Indeed, the company splits the 3 major financial statements along these lines deep in the appendix of the 10-k on pages 65-67."

2014-01-07 14:09:10,"Yes and Buffett doesn't have $7 trillion to spend either!

I think what Buffett did with that example was show us that if investing in productive assets makes much more sense than investing in gold at one level (the level being purchasing either all the gold in the world or farmland/businesses), then that ought to be the case at every other level as well.

If you had $7 trillion to invest and you had to pick gold or productive assets, why would that change if suddenly we're talking about $7000? Would you rather have $7000 worth of productive farmland and American enterprise, or some gold to stare at?

Buffett is showing that the opportunity cost of investing in gold (forgoing the opportunity to invest in productive businesses) is simply not worth it.

That's just my interpretation though! I've had to watch that same video dozens of times for it to really sink into my thick head hah!"
2014-01-07 14:05:25,"Exactly what I thought of when I listened to this. In the United States you don't think of inflation as being really all that significant. You expect what is in your bank account today will be the same amount in one year if nothing is added or taken away. However, in other countries, [Argentina] for example, simply by holding gold and hoping no price decay, you may have a 25% return because of inflation. If I was worried that my net worth could drop by 25% just by staying in cash, I would absolutely consider gold as an investment that could easily be turned into cash as needed.  

(http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/03/argentina-tax-idUSL2N0KD14J20140103)

We applied the discounted cash flow and discounted earnings to the top ranked predictable companies, and calculated the intrinsic values of the these companies. These are the companies that appeared to be undervalued as measured by discounted cash flow model or discounted earning model. The formula and methodology are described in What worked in the market from 1998-2008? Intrinsic Value, Discounted Cash Flow and Margin of Safety. The assumptions for the calculations are:

We assumed a discount rate of 12%.
The tangible book values of the business is used as the current book value.

The growth rate for the next 10 years are assumed to be the same as the average growth rate of the past 10 years. If the growth rate is higher than 15%, we will use 15%.
and for the terminal values, we use 4% growth rate.
Compared with the DCF Calculator, in this page we use the EPS of the last fiscal year as default earnings, and the average of the first 5-year period and the second 5-year period as the default growth. While in the DCF calculator we use TTM EPS and 10-year compound growth rate as default.
The intrinsic value of the companies are calculated with:

Intrinsic Value = Book Value + Future Earnings at Growth Stage + Terminal Value"

For example, I probably wouldn't have gone out of my way to learn pension accounting on my own without studying it for the Level II exam.  And I do believe you need to understand pension accounting to understand how the income statement can be manipulated by pension assumptions and whether a pension fund is underfunded and a large liability to a company (by *your* analysis.  Not what the company tells you.)

If you can learn this on your own, major props.  I just kind of figured if you have to learn it, you might as well take the CFA Level I and Level II exams.  Plus passing the exams helps if you're trying to get a job in the industry.

2014-01-05 12:36:18,"Hello Achillies Value, 
this is amazing information and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much for your answer. I also tend to sit in the absolute value camp, and like DCF's, but in this particular company's case they have just turned Adj. EBITDA profitable 2 years ago and are a small player that is likely to be bought out by a larger one soon (or expand rapidly through buying out other small players) so the value is mainly derived through its special situation status.

I'll try out some of your suggestions. Thank you again!"
2014-01-05 09:11:45,"This gets into the debate of relative vs absolute investing. Einhorn says in his book he is absolute return investor. I dont manage money for others so I obviously never want to lose money but care much more about long term returns not absolute. However, back to main point for absolute return investor 20% not bad and he outperformed vast majority of hedge funds (including long/short)"
2014-01-05 06:37:40,"A scam requires dishonesty, no? If retained assets can be reinvested at risk-adjusted rates competitive with the market, then it's just an economic decision to defer dividends. 

In any case, the blog writer is wrong to suggest that a dividend is superior to a buyback at overvalued levels. They are close to the same thing. To the extent that a buyback squanders value, the fault lies with the shareholder for effectively building a stake (holding on despite buybacks) despite over valuation.
"
2014-01-05 05:31:46,"I guess the best way to do it would be to extend the DCF out to the point when they become cash flow positive after the spike in capex drops out and make an assumption of normalised cash flow at that point. Of course this may be tricky but you will need to get an idea of what a business like that could reasonably be worth based on comparables and from modelling the operational drivers (i.e. subs growth, mkt share) that feed into the DCF.

Two publicly listed comps that might be worth a look are Iliad (ILD FP) and Jazztel (JAZ SM) which are both investing heavily in their networks and are not expected to produce positive cash flows until 2015 at the earliest. Maybe getting hold of any broker notes on these companies may help to give you an idea of how research analysts are valuing them."
2014-01-05 01:27:55,"Start with the base which should be liquidation value.  I don't have too much familiarity with EU telecom but in the US spectrum, towers, and other fixed assets have substantial value.  

Since FCF and EBITDA are irrelevant look at some industry specific valuation methodologies including EV / subscriber, revenue / subscriber, etc.  Some companies in telecom would never make money as an independent company but their network would be worth a lot to a strategic buyer.  I would also recommend looking at EV / Revenue and EV / Gross Profit vs peers.  The gross profit ratio gets rid of accounting gunk and the revenue ratio is the ""activist ratio"" showing how efficient the company is being run per $ of revenue.  Two things to keep in mind though make sure your comparing apples to apples, as you mentioned the internet connectivity which might make your company different than a normal telecom company.  Also remember the methods I suggested are relative value methodologies vs absolute value.  There are many successful relative value portfolio managers and to each their own but I firmly sit in the absolute value camp."

Yeah, real estate is not really my area either. I keep this small and more out of interest since this is a local company with most of the developments in my city. A city with a huge deficit in apartments compared to the number of companies and people moving in.

2012-05-26 08:23:45,Well the standard formula for working with preferred stock is (dividend/required rate of return) = price. Instead of approximating your required rate of return we can do a little algebra and given your price = 60 and dividend = 5/year we can show that the required rate of return that justifies this investment is 8.3%. So if you require anything less than 8.3% per year (consider risk and other uses of the funds) then investment is a good use of your money.

2012-05-25 14:24:42,"This is why I would personally advise doing your own research rather than following that done by other companies. Instead of picking a big bank like JPM why not first start out with a few smaller banks so that you get a feel for how banks are generally structured, when you are comfortable with those then you can start looking/valuing the various businesses that JPM runs.

Remember that Trefis is it's own business, if their valuations were very accurate then everyone would simply use that and make a whole bunch of money. I can't stress the importance of doing your research."
2012-05-25 14:21:16,"&gt;How do you utilize this information?

Well, you could buy stocks that are undervalued according to Trefis and wait till they become overvalued to sell.


&gt;And how cold they accurately figure out how much one aspect of their business affects there stock prices, when stock prices are determined by so many different factors by different investors? 

They look at the various sources of revenue a company has. It's more about fundamentals of the business and using those to base stock price on.

2012-05-25 03:57:53,"JPM is very difficult to value, as are most banks.  You would normally split the business into five sections or possibly more:

1. lending
2. trading/processing
3. fee earning advisory
4. fee earning asset/wealth management
5. investments

The easiest to value is the fee earning asset management business, as this typically generates a steady revenue stream each year, although its not that steady as the fees depend on assets under management which depend on the level of the stock market or other market.

Fee earning advisory can have good years and bad years.  Fees are typically earned when the bank raises equity or debt on the primary or secondary markets.  In times when the stock market is booming this can be a very profitable business, but in bad times it is a shocking business: it is characterised by very high fixed costs (salaries).

Trading can be a good business and a steady earner if the bank  has a strong franchise. e.g. the bank might be a specialist commodity trader and earn brokerage fees facilitating customer trades.  However, in this business margin can be very thin.  Revenues tend to increase when the underlying market is ""hot"".  When the market is bearish revenues can dry up.

Investments - this is when the bank invests its own capital in companies (private equity) or projects (e.g. a power station).  This can be a volatile business, but can also produce good returns.  Difficult to value illiquid investments where there is no public market.

A pure lending/deposit business can simplistically be valued using net assets as a starting point (loans less deposits).  Then adjusted upwards if the bank has a strong franchise which enables it to mitigate risk and obtain good pricing on its loans.  Conversely a bank that experiences significant bad loans or lends at weak margins should be valued at a discount to net assets.  Look at many European banks which trade at substantial discounts to net assets: this sector if rife with bad loans and poorly priced loans.

In summary: its very difficult to value a universal bank like JPM.  Each business must be valued separately.  The profits of many areas in a universal bank depend on the levels and level of activity in the markets, over which the bank has little or no control."
2012-05-25 00:43:42,"You may want to check out [Trefis](http://www.trefis.com/). They break down a companies stock by their revenue sources and what they think the stock is actually worth based on that. It's very interactive, you can do your own forecast and I highly recommend them!

2012-05-23 04:42:30,"The way that you're adjusting the cash flow is conservative.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I would look for instances where AR grows much faster than Sales or when AP is growing much faster than expenses.  I would also adjust cash flow to penalize serial acquirers.  Those expenses should be included in CapEx and when they are usually included within Asset Sales/Purchases line items.

I see Balance Sheet and Cash Flow/Earnings Valuations as two separate approaches to compare to one another.  You are adding more than non operating assets to the PV of your adjusted cash flows. This will result in double counting (someone mentions this below).  Operating assets can transform into earnings like matter can transform into energy.  How efficient this process is depends on the business being discussed as well as management.  Non-operating assets are usually just sit there and do nothing.  [Geoff Gannon wrote a great post on this about a year ago](http://www.gannononinvesting.com/blog/asset-earnings-equivalence.html).  

Greenwald discusses Balance Sheet Analysis as well as Earnings Power Value in [Value Investing From Graham to Buffett and Beyond](http://www.amazon.com/Value-Investing-Graham-Buffett-Finance/dp/0471463396).  I think what he discusses there will help you greatly in what you're trying to accomplish.

2012-05-22 01:02:54,Some of my better finds have been those where I didn't use any sort of models but had simply followed the company for a while and knew it inside out. When a buying opportunity presented itself I was ready to jump inn.
2012-05-22 01:00:26,"I think it will be a mixture of some metrics and a qualitative approach, a buyback for the sake of buying back shares doesn't make sense if the company is overvalued on the stock market, however a well timed buyback at a point when share prices are depressed returns a lot of value to the shareholders. Some management teams are also a lot better capital allocation then other's and in those cases it makes a lot more sense to let them re-invest earnings into the business rather than paying out a dividend.

And remember to make adjustments when dealing with companies in different industries you can't use the same exact template for each company you value."
2012-05-22 00:06:32,"I worked for a company in the real estate industry which caters to large corporations - and we were Screwed royally by their lack of payment. Invoices would sit on the books for sometimes as long as three years, we rarely wrote anything off, and had no leverage to collect. So it's not necessarily a company like Netflix which suffers from using AR to bolster sales. 
  
I find willingness to write off bad debt to keep AR manageable as a sign of good management, as well as maintaining AP at a certain level. This latter point shows stability of cash flows because you can keep your payables at the same aging over the course of your operations. It also reflects on management as they are able to budget accurately."

2012-05-21 23:28:47,"I wasn't aware IBM had a policy to demonstrate return to shareholders. That's pretty interesting, I will look in their financials to see if I can read up on it.  
  
I guess the best investments would be ones that maximize return to shareholders (dividends &amp; buy backs) without reducing the efficiency of their revenue generating operations. Is the only way to measure this done by analyzing the historical amount spent on dividends &amp; buy backs? 
  
That also begs the question, how do you tell whether a dollar of after-tax income is best returned to shareholders or re-invested in the company? Are there any metrics available to measure this, or is it a qualitative decision left to management?  "
2012-05-21 23:20:22,"My thinking regarding intangibles is forming a liquidation-price. In other words, if I buy this company right now and cease operations, what am I left with to sell? The answer would be assets less liabilities. Most assets are easier to value than a company's intangibles.  
  
Then I add on to that liquidation price the present value of continuing operations.  
  
Now I am thinking you are right- that intangibles would be priced into the value of current operations because they generate revenue, therefore by including them in the liquidation price as well, I would be double-counting them."
2012-12-15 02:56:59,"Market cap shouldn't matter if you are looking for value. An overpriced small cap is worse than an undervalued large cap. While large caps are the subject of focus and analysis, it doesn't mean they aren't good value and they have a track record to look up. While its hard to have an edge on anyone in large caps, you might be able to ride the trend, but that is speculation. What I'm trying to get at is that it doesn't matter what everyone else does if you are investing well, right? Don't worry about things outside your control."
2012-12-15 00:30:21,"You seems to be suggesting that the market is more efficient when there are more participants (more eye balls, the more correctly price reflect value).  But this would imply that large caps are less susceptible to bubbles and busts, which is clearly not the case.

In a stock bubble, when large cap stocks are on average over-priced, it does make sense to look at small caps for value. But in a bust, large cap stocks may also offer value. 

For example, AIG at 1/2 book value (and 2.5x P/E) seems pretty under-valued to me."

2012-12-10 21:37:01,"The concept of the ""net-net"" comes from Benjamin Graham. The general idea is to invest in a business with a market capitalization that is lower than the value of the company's current assets minus all liabilities. Usually the current assets are discounted according to their marketability with cash receiving almost no discount and inventory receiving a large discount.

Usually only pretty crappy businesses ever become net-nets. However, the nice thing is that expectations are so low, even the slightest positive business developments can result in big gains. On the other hand, many net-nets don't ever turn around. They burn through their assets bit by bit and eventually have to declare bankruptcy."

Here's an example:

Share Price          $40.00

EPS                       $2.00

Earnings Yield               5%

Shares Bought	500,000

Cost/Debt Incurred	$20,000,000.00

Shares outstanding After	2,000,000


Assume the AT cost of debt at the following rates:

AT Cost of Debt	3.000%

AT Cost of Debt	5.000%

AT Cost of Debt	8.000%


At 3%, the move is accretive which should be good for the shares.  At 5% there is no change to EPS and at 8%, the move is dilutive and share price should fall.

I believe US GAAP and IFRS have very similar guidance on what R&amp;D costs can be capitalized as intangibles (R - all expensed, D - capitalized after a criteria list is met).  


Revaluation under US GAAP was not permitted, however, under IFRS classes of intangible assets can be revalued to fair value.



Pages 16 + 17:

2012-11-29 16:41:38,"To touch on a one of your points regarding biotech:

The companies are not just all overvalued, companies in the industry are valued on a weighted probability mindset: some will become homeruns and others will fail or are developing inferior technology.  Honestly, outside of a few large firms like Genentech, it's pretty hard to figure out which ones are in the homerun pile and which ones are in the fail pile. 

An example: 3 firms develop a DNA sequencing technology that will capture a $4 billion market potential in terms of free cash flow. These 3 firms are the whole market and each firm's only business line.  The market will value these companies by the probability that each will succeed.  Perhaps it will give $2 billion to 1 firm, $1 billion to another, and $1 billion to a third.  In truth, the technology of one firm will overrun the technology that the other two are developing.  The market has no idea which one will be dominant.  So the value of each of the three companies will be driven by the weighted probability that that company's technology will succeed and the others will fail.

I hope you can follow that train of thought, but that was my conclusion after looking through some biotech companies.  You are taking somewhat of a gamble by trying to pick out the ones that will succeed because you lack information.  Their intangible assets are not overvalued; in fact for a few of them, they are tremendously undervalued.  You do not (and most people do not) have enough information and expertise to know which ones of those are undervalued without a thorough knowledge of the technology they are attempting to develop.  If you did have the expertise, the companies do not reveal enough information as the information is the driver of their future success.  Thus, it's a black box.

2012-11-29 15:56:43,Does anyone have the rest of this video? It cuts off just when Bruce actually gets some challenging questions.
2012-11-29 10:19:12,"The biggest issue of all is whether a consumer goods company will ever IPO again.  While that is an over-exaggeration, I doubt there will be a new US car manufacturer.  While its easy to say there will be a few more exceptions than Tesla, its also easy to see the funding pressures towards companies with moats such as IP, and other competition breaking activities, means that any exceptions are in fact exceptions in an investment world that shuns ""real"" businesses.

What is breaking the value investment paradigm even more is the tech companies going to market are doing so as pure scams against investors, guaranteeing to never pay dividends (dual shares), and preventing take overs (netflix poison pills), and using the company as a [personal piggy bank for insiders](http://www.naturalfinance.net/2012/07/minority-shareholder-discount-to.html)

So, a bigger problem than valuing intangibles in tech companies, is valuing the fact that there is no intention to ever repay you, and the only consideration is will the hype continue past the point that you can flip out of the pyramid scheme.

Another issue with Graham in general is the existence of Net Net companies, that trade below book and liquidation value, and have a recent history of profitability.  The theoretical accounting benefits of voluntary or takeover liquidation are worthless in the face of management obstruction and corruption of shareholder interests."
2012-11-29 06:25:38,"That interviewer clearly didn't know a whole value managers, and her questions weren't terribly insightful. You could totally sense Berkowitz's lack of intellectual stimulation when it came time for Q&amp;A and he was asking for harder questions."
2012-11-29 03:27:52,"You are essentially correct.

Tech companies by nature are investment in the (uncertain) future. The current stock price reflects optimism about the company's patented product or competitive advantage (data analysis or algorithms, as you mention). These intangibles are the company's greatest asset, but also their greatest liability. 

For example, having the best algorithm will give a company a huge advantage over their competitors, giving them market dominance and commanding p/e premiums. But what if someone else comes up with a better algorithm? Having the second best algorithm means the company is guaranteed to fail in the long run.

As you correctly stated, in order to determine the durability of their current advantage, you need to dive into understanding their technology itself, which maybe require expertise beyond security analysis. 

This is why tech companies often (but not always) end up in my ""too hard"" pile."
2012-11-29 01:55:26,"There does seem to be an overemphasis at present on future earnings and not fundamental values.

There are so many people investing like Graham (any ""bottom-up"" fund manager, and many, many others that label themselves differently) that finding value is exceptionally difficult now.  This is why the hedge funds that are seem to still making money are either activists, or exploiting problems in the structure of the markets (arb, HFT, blah blah blah).  The rest are just a toss-up, like conventional MFs, based on what I've been paying attention to.

""Initial investment capital"" alludes to primary issues of debt and equity.  Your post is more complex-sounding that it needs to be."
2012-11-28 22:59:11,"I think it is critical to acknowledge the difference between the accounting value and economic value of a firm.

There are many aspects of business which are poorly represented by GAAP conventions. One of the greatest departures is way in which goodwill and intangible assets are recorded in the financial statements.

You are correct in your assessment that the intangibles of technology firms are valuable. The limits of accounting specifically, and quantification in general, are the walls that screening consistently bump up against. This is especially true for technology firms that develop their assets through R&amp;D, as opposed to purchase assets like PP&amp;E and inventories.

Warren Buffet presents a great article in his 1983 letter to Berkshire Hathaway share holders: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1983.html

You may find the appendix particularly insightful. It is longer discussion of the meaningful difference between economic goodwill and accounting goodwill.

"
2012-11-28 22:14:21,"In the past I use to think like this to. And it is true. Intangible assets really do balloon some businesses asset values especially if you are looking at technology companies. 

I had a big miss with Qualcomm when I ran a computer program and saw that there tangible asset value with earnings growth etc showed the stock to be around 13 dollars. 

Some of graham's prinicples don't work in today's market, but his key priniciples i.e. earnings power and safety of margin still are classic and fundamental.

To answer your question, intangible assets are valueable, but you need to find out what their earnings power is. "

2012-11-27 11:57:49,"&gt; The acquisition premium ($5.2 billion): To justify this premium, HP would have to had to believe that one or more of the following held:  (i) the market was undervaluing Autonomy, i.e., that the true value of Autonomy was much higher than the $ 5.9 billion, (ii) there are synergies between HP and Autonomy that have value, i.e., that there are value-enhancing actions that the combined firm (HP+Autonomy) can take that could not have been taken by the firms independently and/or (iii) ***that Autonomy was badly run and that changing the way it was run could make it more valuable***, i.e., there is a control premium.

And if so does that imply that public companies are inherently worth more than private ones?

Also, who would have thought that Autonomy was worth $11bn even with the world's most conservative accounting? Its technology lead evaporated several years ago and it has never become the enterprise player that it wanted to become. It was the Silicon Fen favorite in the dot com days but since then it has struggled to stay relevant.

If you're a skeptic, I highly recommend reading one or both of Toby's books. I think you'll change your mind."

2015-08-17 00:22:42,Agreed. More of a self promoter than an actual investor.

2015-08-17 00:07:29,"Forget about ""stocks"" for a minute.  

How much experience do you have in business?  If ""investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike"", then you should know about business.  You should know less about beta and ratios, and more about how the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cashflows work together.  Once you understand this, it will be much easier.  It will make eminent sense; simply, intuitively.  (Remember, Buffett failed at running a gas station.  But did he really?  I bet he learned a lot in that failure about the stuff I mentioned above.  Perhaps more than at university.) 

If you don't know, then make a point to learn.  Go to a few classes at the local community college.  Read immensely.  Maybe even buy/start a local small business with a plan to wind it up in a few years (it probably costs less than a year of university, and you will learn a lot more).  

And then read Security Analysis.  And then it will all make sense.  It will seem obvious, because you will have a background that understands what to look for, and what to avoid.  You will see why Buffett was able to put so much in Coca-Cola.  You'll be like ""Of course!"" while others worry about being overexposed to losses.

Plainly, you must build the foundation for understanding of business in order to substantially succeed in the investment world.  Investment in business requires knowledge of business.  I believe Graham writes that ""analysis of a security requires analysis of the business.""  Once you know what to look for, it is plain to see.  And there is no teacher like experience.   "

EDIT: Would have loved to have heard some commentary on why MOV spent $50m on share buybacks already over the past two years, and shares outstanding are only down by 1.2m over the same period. Over a 10-year period MOV has spent $100m on buybacks and shares outstanding have net increased by 1 million as they've issued equity over the same period. In this case, the company has been destroying value with buybacks rather than creating it. "

2015-08-16 15:39:59,"Found this online:

How to value a biotech company? There's a question merits being broken down into its constituent parts, so let's take each word in turn.

""How to""
The Vault Guide tells us that there are three methods of valuing a company. I interviewed so many candidates for investment banking analyst positions that I would have to commit suicide if I repeated them again, so I won't. Look em up if you really care--the short answer is that the ""how"" of valuing biotech companies isn't dramatically different from the way you value industrial companies or tech companies. The metrics differ, to be sure, as do the parameters. I can't think of anyone who pays attention to GAAP EPS in biotech; it's either Adjusted EPS or (since most biotechs are loss-making) something related to sales.

But there is one salient difference from other industries: You can't sell drugs in the US, or most countries for that matter, without approval from the national health authority. Until FDA or EMEA says your drug works, or at least determines that it doesn't kill people faster than the disease it's indicated for, there is no guarantee that you will sell any of it. Hence the need for biotech investors and companies to base valuations off of expected sales, which are sales estimates adjusted by probabilities that have been derived from years and years of data on drug approval/rejection rates. Companies, hedge funds and most sell-side analysts do this. There's another way to account for the risk of regulatory rejection, which is to simply bump up the discount rate that you apply to future cash flows--some sell-side analysts do this, but for their sake I won't say their names.

""value""
A couple of weeks ago, a banker told me a funny joke (well, funny for biotechies): ""Knock knock."" ""Who's there?"" ""Gilead."" ""Gilead who?"" ""Gilead Sciences Inc., the most successful biotech hedge fund of the last decade.""

For those of you who aren't ""in the know"", Gilead is not a hedge fund at all. It's a regular corporation, a biotech company that's based, like many biotech companies, in Northern California, and was founded in the first great boom of biotech sometime in the 1980's or so. It is also currently worth about $160 billion dollars. It's the biggest biotech company in the world by market cap, eclipsing even Silicon Valley's other legend,  Genentech, when it was gobbled up by Roche in 2008. Gilead is 2.5x as valuable as Hewlett-Packard, 4x as valuable as EADS, the world's largest airplane manufacturer, almost 3x as valuable as Ford Motor Co., barely smaller than Oracle, and comfortably larger than two of the five Oil Supermajors. 

If you had bought a share of Gilead in September 2004, your split-adjusted return since then would be about 1,100%. There are probably hedge funds that have returned more, but unlike them, your share of Gilead wouldn't have cost you 2% of your basis and 20% of the profits in good years. Unlike many hedge funds or other highly acquisitive companies like Pfizer, Gilead has an astonishingly good track record of creating shareholder value through investing in external growth. In one of the most spectacularly successful M&amp;A deals that the US healthcare industry has ever seen, Gilead paid $11 billion in late 20011 for Pharmasset. The notes the next morning were brutal. ""Overpaid."" ""Significant development risk."" ""Don't understand the thesis."" Blablabla. Three years later, the company has more than quintupled in value, and the drug that Gilead acquired with Pharmasset, PSI-7977 (sofosbuvir) is expected to exceed that purchase price in annual sales.

What is one to take from this parable? Well, I think it boils down to 3 things:
You can be denounced as a fool until suddenly everyone realizes you are a prophet.
Biotech companies hate being ""value"" companies. They want to be ""growth"" companies.
Value in biotech is not relative. It's absolute.

""a biotech company""
Wait, what? What's so complicated about ""a biotech company""? Well, start with the obvious problem: ""Biotech company"" is about as specific a term as ""tech company"". Is AAPL a tech company, or a consumer company? Is AMZN a tech company or an internet company? What about IBM? Oracle? Strictly speaking, the healthcare-oriented meanings of biotech refer to the relatively recent ability of humanity to harness biological processes to make drugs or detect diseases. 

And many, perhaps most ""biotech companies"" do exactly that--use biological processes to make drugs. Gilead does that. Amgen does that. Genentech, now owned by Roche, does that. So do Vertex, Alexion and Regeneron. Unlike the traditional drugs that your grandmother force-fed to your mother, ""biotech drugs"" like recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors are made with the help of processes that are, in many ways, far smarter and far more efficient than anything human minds could ever have come up with on their own. 

But quite a few prominent biotech companies have very little to do with these types of drug, or are not valued solely on the basis of these drugs if they have them in their portfolio. The newest blockbuster drug to hit the market from Biogen Idec, an enormous company that plays heavily in the nervous system diseases space, is a multiple sclerosis drug called Tecfidera®; if you used to work with leather a lot, you might know it by its generic name, dimethyl fumarate, and as a chemical entity, it has been very known for decades. It was used to treat leather so as to prevent mold growth. Another gigantic biotech, Celgene Corp., was actually spun out years ago from a big industrial chemicals conglomerate called Celanese Corporation. Celgene has a dynamite franchise of drugs for blood cancers and multiple myeloma: REVLIMID®, Pomalyst® and THALOMID®. All three are derivatives of thalidomide, which like Tecfidera was known to doctors decades ago and prescribed as a treatment for morning sickness (this usage eventually stopped, because thalidomide causes ghastly birth defects). Clearly, then, being considered a biotech company doesn't really have much to do with how complex the molecules are that drive your core revenue streams.

Adding to the confusion is the existence of hulking old Big Pharma companies that are increasingly starting to look like biotech companies. Nobody doubts Pfizer, Merck &amp; Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson are pharma companies, but there's a small chorus of people who think that another stalwart of the American drug business, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., behaves a lot more like biotech than pharma. Certainly on a multiples basis it trades at a premium to some of the Big Biotechs I mentioned above, which would appear to be a violation of the conventional wisdom that biotechs are more expensive because they are faster-growing. French pharma giant Sanofi SA scooped up Genzyme, a maker of biologic drugs for extremely rare diseases, and holds a big chunk of Regeneron, another biologics company that does cancer and eye diseases. AstraZeneca plc fended off an unsolicited offer from Pfizer in part by arguing to shareholders that it ought to be valued like a biotech rather than a pharma, which is to say, big dependence on a ""pipeline"" of highly speculative immunotherapeutics, for things like cancer. 

To be sure, nobody claims that Sanofi or AstraZeneca are biotech companies, nor is anyone about to do so. But what exactly constitutes a biotech company is now a very nebulous concept. There was a point in time when biotech could be distinguished from traditional pharma by the discovery, research and development methods used; but now, those methods are used in drug development everywhere. One might have argued some years ago that the chief distinction between biotech and pharma was simply one of higher multiples to give credit for faster growth potential. Perhaps, but that is no longer the case. Many pharma's, like AstraZeneca, BMS and Takeda, have gone on acquisition sprees in attempt to gain some of the biotech mojo (with varying degrees of success), and there has been a considerable amount of cannibalization among biotechs too. A few years hence, the distinction between biotech and pharma may disappear altogether. A few years ago on CNBC, I saw Sam Isaly, one of the founding partners of the brilliant life sciences hedge fund OrbiMed Advisors remark that it was perhaps just a matter of time before the Big Four of biotech--Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Idec and Celgene--either got acquired by pharma companies...or themselves went out and acquired pharma companies, thereby dissolving the barrier between the industries for good.

If you're just starting out, best to use a fantasy stock picker.  Don't use real money until you have a good grasp of investing fundamentals.

Intelligent investor is IMHO an excellent introductory book.  After that, if you're able to stay awake from Graham's professory prose, you can tackle Security Analysis, which is his magnum opus.

Also strongly suggest a subscription to the WSJ and use it often.  Read as many annual reports as you have time to read.  Get a solid grasp of not only market fundamentals, but the fundamentals of each element of the market.

2015-08-15 17:40:14,"“Everyone loves a comeback” – you’ve probably heard that phrase applied many times to down-on-their-luck movie stars or sportsmen trying to mount a career resurgence. But the public fascination with comebacks applies equally to the capital markets. In fact, turnaround stories are a necessary product of how the market works every day: the very nature of the capitalist system pushes the winners to expand and gain share, and the losers to shrink, regroup, and try again (as long as they’re still in business). While of course every situation is a bit different, in general turnarounds can be great opportunities for investors, as whenever a company is radically changing the composition of its business there is a higher degree of uncertainty as to what that company’s future will look like – and hence there can exist considerably divergent views on the future value of a given stock (which allows you to make $$ if you get it right).

Where I differ from most, I suppose, is that instead of looking at restructuring companies as an opportunity to buy businesses on the dip, I instead try to identify situations where the turnaround is either doomed to failure, or will take a lot longer (and be more painful) than the market is expecting. Perhaps I am pessimistic by nature, but I have noticed that investors in general – and the sell-side community in particular – perennially over-estimate the likelihood of a comeback business regaining its former glory. I am not sure if this speaks to the poor quality of sell-side analysts (perhaps), who tend to believe a given company’s managers when they promise a successful turnaround; or perhaps it is to do with the eternal optimism of human nature as it pertains to the stock market (since, of course, over the long-term economies grow and stocks invariably rise). But in any case, as these overly-optimistic expectations are disappointed, the companies’ stocks tend to underperform, and as a result you can make money betting against these nascent comebacks either not getting off the ground, or taking a whole lot longer to get going.

I knew the pricing in US is HUGE out of whack, but i did some super envelope math on the contracts on LNG, and it seemed damn expensive. From an securityanalysis perspective is the company super overhyped (like i was lead to believe in my initial overview?)

Also the CEO of Cheniere is super freaking well compensated IIRC.

"
2015-08-14 23:49:44,"edit: I wrote this whole reply and now realise you meant the ticker, 'LNG.'  fuck it

Baupost does not hold VSN as far as I know.  He's active across the O&amp;G space -- off the top of my head, ALDW, Cheniere, and PXD, so the whole stream.  You really have to judge each terminal by its own merits (and timing).  Cheniere was a first mover brownfield project (I think Klarman had been involved since pre-2008 era when everybody was building import terminals?).  

[This](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/24870/falling_short.html) and [this](http://www.igu.org/sites/default/files/node-page-field_file/IGU%20-%20World%20LNG%20Report%20-%202014%20Edition.pdf) make for a good introduction to the lng trade.  And Deutsche Bank's Dec 1, 2014 note, ""Global LNG.""

2 things concerning Jordan Cove:

(1)  ~2020 is the timing all the terminals are racing to get contracts for as a sizable portion of global lng contracts will be renewed.  Asia is ~80% global demand.  A large portion of this is Japan since it is an island.  Japanese LNG demand commanded record prices as its prominence shot through the roof post-Fukushima.  Bears speculate that Asia's future demand for lng will not necessarily be muted but that it will not be as aggressively optimistic due to (a) rumors and progress that Japan is restarting its nuclear reactors (little by little), and (b) a generally softened outlook on the Asian/Chinese economy.  So, demand will not be as strong as once thought but also there is a bollus of new supply coming onstream.  To put it into perspective, in 2013 Qatar accounted for 33% of global lng exports, and Australia accounted for 9%; by 2017 Australia will be neck and neck with Qatar for largest exporter.  (I think Klarman might have some lng interests in Autralia as well).  

(2)  The way lng is priced everywhere but USA is that it is a dated (90 days?) function of the Brent price.  This made sense back in the pre-fracing days when gas was recovered at the top of a traditionally drilled reservoir, but since 2008, when gas was the first thing getting fracced, the gas-crude relationship became unhinged.  This resulted in lng prices based on $100+ bbl crude, but in the USA nat gas was crazy cheap at the Henry Hub, so lng buyers were bitching about the cheapness of NA gas vs. ROW lng.  Well now that crude has fallen off the cliff, lng buyers are rethinking their animosity toward the dated Brent function.

I believe these things indicate that it's not going to be a seller's market.

In the latest concall mgmt noted that the shipper they had ""promised"" to have signed in Q2 went back to the drawing board due to the above variables."

Special situations comprise only a very small percentage of the lifetime of a security.

In theory, you average out over the economic cycle.  In practice, you turn off the models designed for ""normal conditions"" during special situations.  Once the storm clears you can turn them back on.  It's also a good idea to have a hedge in place that profits from these black swan dislocations."

2015-08-14 12:19:43,"I believe a lot of the underlying assumptions of Black-Scholes make it extremely unreliable. I read a book once called The (Mis)Behavior of Markets that goes through a lot of modern portfolio theory and how it is essentially crap.

I believe BS assumes that volatility remains constant, which is false. Also, I believe when you input historic volatility it is as an estimate of the implied constant volatility. I remember he used an example of how, if you plug in option prices, strike, and other inputs to yield the implied volatility, the result isn't constant for differing strike prices, which I believe it should be. Long story short, I never use BS."

* [Ticker] will compound at a low-to-mid teens return over [projected period], driven by (1)...(2)...(3).
* Further detail on (1)/(2), stress your opinion that differs from consensus.
* Tie it all in...result of (1)-(3) will drive a [x] FCF yield that will be intelligently allocated in the form of (debt paydown/share buyback/dividend increase/etc).

2015-08-13 23:00:09,"Black-Scholes has always been broken. These days, the only thing it's useful for is to give a one-to-one correspondence between option price and *implied* volatility. 


One of the underlying assumptions of Black-Scholes is that stock returns follow a normal distribution (or alternatively that stock prices follow a lognormal distribution). That's totally wrong. Once the market figured this out, we've seen a volatility smile form that should not exist if Black-Scholes actually worked: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile


Another thing that's wrong with Black-Scholes is that volatility is assumed to be constant. However, we see that there are clearly shifts in regimes between low and high volatility as seen here:

If you're pricing options using historical data, good luck when the volatility regime shifts on you."
2015-08-13 22:45:52,"BS is calculated based on modern statistics concepts - particularly that of standard deviations. The typical BS model will calculate everything within a calculable number of deviations from the mean, typically accounting for 99%+ of all probable outcomes. 

In short - BS models exclude all outcomes that exist beyond the 99% threshold because it would render the BS model results inaccurate. As a result - all 1% or 0.1% outcomes (ie. exceptional events such as the 2007 recession) fall outside of the scope of the BS model and would render it useless."

The exciting stuff that's publicly traded is locked up in large cap E&amp;P or diversified services companies.  This limits the new tech's contribution to the whole and introduces unrelated risks.  Think AWS within AMZN: great cloud tech, but it's attached to an online Walmart.

I think OP is talking about FCF as a profitability measure, such as operating or net income. This type of FCF calculation, which includes changes in net borrowings, doesn't indicate any true level of profitability. It's also kind of why I exclude changes in working capital as well from my FCF calculations (except at the firm level).

2015-11-24 20:09:14,"He owns 70% of the company and under SEC regulations is unable to sell for at least six months or his money will be confiscated.

Thus whether he is shady or not is irrelevant, the only thing that matters in this case is that he is knowledgeable. Based on how much he has invested thus far, we can conclude that he strongly believes in the potential of this company.

2015-11-24 12:55:54,"No it's not just a dumb move.  He just bought a drug company with a promising subset of efficacy data in a separate indication other than the failed trial, and a clean adverse event profile. He can run a cancer study with like 40 patients and just secured the bank financing to run it without diluting shareholders.  the thing ran up on shkreli news, but it could be a drug worth ~$500mn.

Also - he bought 70% of the float, not 51%. The run up was due to short covering mostly, and is temporarily overvalued. Anyone who is buying above $40 is a moron as the volume traded the last few days means that things have shifted from net short to net long.

2015-11-24 03:27:26,"Another thing to consider is that during his time, investing in net-nets was going against the norm. So that could explain why he had alpha. Now that everyone and their mother understands about net-nets, the bar has been raised (like how nobody benefits if everyone stands on tiptoes at a concert). In order to find the same alpha today, we have to be doing something different from the norm. For Buffett during his time, that was net nets. Today it's something different."
2015-11-24 03:12:42,I think it is a lot of it is the consequence of the environment we are in. Did lots of value investors suddenly independently have the realization that they actually like quality instead?

2015-11-24 02:41:46,[deleted]
2015-11-24 02:33:05,"I think it's important to read a lot to learn about what previous investors did and how they thought. However, I also think it's important not to just mindlessly follow what you read in books and to find your own style. To be a good investor, you have to be willing to create your own system and methods of investing. 

Most people will read a book about Warren Buffett and begin to think that there is only one way to really do investing. That kind of thinking really limits you.

Buffett actually did a lot more than just net-nets in his early days. He was involved in risk arbitrage and even involved himself in his investments as an activist (including with Berkshire). Buffett himself did not mindlessly copy his mentor...he developed his own style, which evolved over time. You're not Buffett.. you do not have his personality, experience, image, resources or talent for influencing management. So maybe it would be better for you to think critically about who you are as a person, incorporate the elements of Buffett's strategy that fits with your personality and develop your own style going forward.

""Know what the old masters did. Know how they composed their pictures, but do not fall into the conventions they established. These conventions were right for them, and they are wonderful. They made their language. You make yours. They can help you. All the past can help you.""

Also one thing about net nets: 'time is the friend of the wonderful business, enemy of the mediocre.' If you buy a good company at an overvalued price, you can be sure it will grow into it, even though it might take time. If you buy a bad business, even at an extremely cheap price, there is a good chance it will burn through whatever value was there, leaving you with nothing."
2015-11-24 02:24:47,"Im not too sure about that claim. The original Berkshire i.e. the textile company was basically a graham investment for him and that was a horrible decision in his own words.

The compounding of a great company with economic goodwill will continuously outperform net-nets. The idea of net-nets is to pretty much sell once it hits valuation i.e. the 50% margin you speak of. You could theoretically continuously compound at 50% if your net-nets get realized by the market annually, but i found that doubtful. 

On the top of my head, i would think a net-net portfolio of say 20 stocks would most likely produce a 20% return (not sure if annually) since some or maybe even most will fail. "
2015-11-24 01:16:06,Yeah I think I'll just stop over analyzing without even starting. Thanks.
2015-11-24 01:11:15,"No, that's not what I meant. I said that he had his best returns in the 50's, where he still invested in net-nets. And once he met Munger, he switched to quality stocks, which was the adequate thing to do since he could not invest in small caps anymore due to the size of capital he was managing back then. 

Since he had his best returns when he was a ""little"" investor while using net-nets, why follow his strategy today when we could follow the old one (net nets)?

2015-11-23 23:38:35,maybe cigar butt was the wrong term. I meant good price vs wonderful business.

2015-11-23 23:29:47,why...what?
2015-11-23 23:17:45,"Why?

"
2015-11-23 21:23:48,"If you read the early parts of Buffet's annual letters, I think it was the early 80's, he specifically talks about how he has moved away from Graham's style &amp; now to his own.

I think he considers Graham as a founding father of investing because Graham was the first to conceptually write down/analyze companies and come up with a valuation of the business intelligently.

I say this because I think your concern is more along the lines of ""How can Buffett be praising Graham &amp; the idea of value investing when he invests quite differently from Graham's original concept?"""
2015-11-23 21:16:56,"I've found myself asking this as well every once in awhile. Buffett seems to be very confident when he said he could ""definitely"" achieve 50% returns if he had a smaller portfolio. As far as I know, that's not really achievable unless you do cigar butt/special situation investing. Quality investing works but you tend to see the results over the long term."

2015-11-23 19:55:41,"Shit man, /u/simon_inaki  proposed this merger in like Q2, fucking Pfizer behind the times."
2015-11-23 19:04:54,"Yeah I'm not sure if it's accurate that small caps give the best returns.  Most of Buffett's best investments were companies that were around for 50+ years by the time he ever purchased them.  I think you're spending too much time focused on portfolio structure and not enough time on individual companies.

My recommendation to you would be to focus less on things like F score and DCA as sources of safety, and more on understanding the business and its future prospects relative to its competitors.  I'd start with picking up an accounting textbook and reading it cover-to-cover.  I know it sounds boring, but there's a reason why such a small sliver of the world falls into the ""successful investor"" category.

Good luck!"
2015-11-23 18:22:08,"Thanks for the reply, and I very much agree with you. The risk is much higher in net-nets, especially because there must be a very good reason for it to be below its liquidiation value.
But what about combining it with an F-Score? Shouldn't that at least mitigate some of the risk involved in buying horrible companies?
It seems to me that a wide moat, a strong brand and DCA do not apply very well to small-caps (for obvious reasons), so it looks like they should be automatically ruled out if you follow Buffett's mantra, but at the same, small-caps are the stocks that give the best returns.
"
2015-11-23 17:28:52,"Buffett's early days were not purely cigar-butts.  In fact, his best returns were on companies that were comparable to his current strategy of purchasing quality companies.  When he reviewed his results he noticed this.  Combined with Charlie drilling it in his head, and realizing that cigar-butts is not a scalable strategy, he was eventually pushed to going exclusively high-quality stocks.

It's a mistake to think that we have comparable access to his old strategies, by the way.  He wasn't purely purchasing cigar-butts in the open market.  A part of his fund was dedicated to work-outs (special situations) and takeovers.  So when he purchased net-nets, he always had the option of placing his own management in place or liquidating if needed (See: Sanborn Maps and Dempster Mills).

I think, in the end of the day, you're better off buying quality stocks.  Some will say net nets no longer exist, but I have found some.  They're all crap though, and there's no assurance that the book value of those assets will ever be realized.  Companies that generate strong cash flows and are shareholder friendly are so much better and lower risk if you don't have the option of making management changes or liquidating."

2015-11-23 08:00:13,"Here's what the two stocks looked like, Friday's close:

Name | Value | PE ratio| LT growth | Div Yield | Upside to Price Target
:--------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:
[Allergan](https://stockflare.com/stocks/AGN) | $123bn | 20x | 9% | 0.0% | 17% (Buy)
[Pfizer](https://stockflare.com/stocks/PFE) | $199bn | 15x | 3% | 3.2% | 26% (Buy)

From the NYTimes

&gt; Under the terms of the proposed deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 Pfizer shares for each of their holdings, the people briefed on the matter said. That is worth about **$363.63** a share, or 16 percent higher than Allergan’s closing price on Friday.

Which is funny, given the average Wall Street Price Target is **$363.93**.

Questions:

0. Is this another tax-inversion deal? That will do Uncle Sam out of tax receipts?
0. Or is this all about buying *growth*?

2015-11-20 19:24:50,Its also worth noting that TERP has all of the call-rights on SUNE projects but they do not have to buy them from SUNE.  The guys at TERP are only taking deals that are good for TERP.  If a project doesnt fit their model and isnt a good quality or doesnt make financial sense to them then SUNE will sell it to a 3rd party.  TERP is high class.

Their total tangible assets are worth more than the market cap of the stock.  "
2015-11-20 17:10:50,"You should do some digging through TERP filings/presentations.  The majority equity stake in TERP from Sun Edison dips to 30% after 3000MW in capacity is reached.  TERP is in the process of breaking away from SUNE.  Currently I think its a 60/40 split thereabouts in terms of SUNE owning a majority stake.  Also, I think people seem to forget that TERP has POSITIVE CASH FLOW GENERATING HIGH QUALITY ASSETS currently in production.  It also does not have to buy projects from SUNE but it can seek out projects in the open market/3rd party.  "

Now their costs as well as their revenues are in the same currency.  This also mitigated the nationalist pride that worked against them (""Buy American!"")."

I think it's generally company-specific in terms of severity. TWX brought down their EPS guide recently, and blamed a bit of that on FX - but there were a ton of underlying issues there as well.

2015-11-20 11:06:33,"I never really think of it like sub analysis on FX and direction, just sensitivity tables on what could happen given the FX slides, and quantifying how bad it can/could get on historical past movements. A company can be great but I mean you just have to deal with the current situation and feel comfortable with the currency. If you look at it and you're like wow this currency could get much much worse, just from a risk standpoint you might have to sit on the sidelines. Alternatively you could try to ""hedge"", ie buying a European multinational and an American international company. This doesn't work in a lot of smaller countries as investable size/confidence in the company gets really diminished. It's just another risk factor that you have to thoughtfully take into consideration. 

And unless you're on the sell side and this matters less, if you're a PM you just have to deal with it and try to make money the best you can with your opportunities. It's not easy and comes with experience I think. (That i don't have lol). "
2015-11-20 11:01:03,"I agree with a lot of what you said.

Project staff are paid in their home currencies, despite the work being conducted in Canada. We use suppliers from around the world (Korea,  Germany,  usa, Mexico,  etc).

A buyback makes it dangerous to sell short a stock. If a company is committed to buying back shares consistently - new demand - you probably don't want to be selling it short."

2012-09-21 14:59:32,"&gt;Yeah, a dividend makes it costly to short. However, so do share repurchases. Think about it - share repurchases actively soak up shares being liquidated, shaking out weak hands. You'd be holding short a stock that is being accumulated at a rate of billions of dollars per year.  
  
I don't understand your meaning...a dividend is going to drive the share price downwards while a buyback will increase the share price.

PS I prefer buybacks because they let the company continue to compound growth, while passing along favorable tax-treatment to shareholders."

In this low yield environment I'll take share repurchases over dividends. Dividends just attract the income crowd, who are generally willing to pay too goddamn much for a company on the basis of yield alone. Buybacks are far more hidden from view, and allow for truly extraordinary compounding when companies buy back their future earnings on the cheap.

In short, I'll take a dividend when I'm holding a company I want to sell. I'll let the income investors buy it from me at a premium. For companies I want to hold forever, I prefer repurchases. Keep that price low and accumulate!

Now that I'm on a rant, I have a couple dividend stocks that I wish would slash their dividends to zero and repurchase shares. Their yields are attracting too much attention.

2012-09-21 06:49:10,Plus its insurance against people shorting the stock too badly. Everyone can see through a company who has missed earnings trying to buyback some stock to raise EPS and it wont keep the stock price up by itself if the companys financials are suffering.

2012-09-20 21:10:38,"That's a good article. Hadn't seen that one.

The article basically says 10% out of 19% advantage over the market is due to 1.6 leverage, and the rest is from picking good stocks.

 It is said that if you buy and sell  stocks following Berkshire's public announcements, you'd get 10% return over S&amp;P, so that's in agreement.

Buffet's use of leverage is well known. He has said that the reason he bought an insurance company was to use it's float for investing. His first insurance company was bought in 1967.

Buffet's picks of good companies at a cheap price is also well known. 

So why hasn't more money managers matched his performance? 1.6x leverage seems extremely modest by today's investment banking standards.

The results aren't very noteworthy though. Finding mild significance in in a positively skewed sample with positively skewed factors is not surprising. 

But supposing the results are solid, the study also opens some anew questions, e.g. How did buffet manage to identify persistently low beta stocks? Leveraged BAB portfolios would likely still not perform as well because turnover/rebalancing would expose you to the short term capital gains tax rate. But then perhaps low beta is persistent for long periods of time so turnover is low."

2012-09-08 13:25:07,"matts1213 gave a similar explanation(below) over in r/investing about a month ago. 

amzn sort of reminds me of coca cola. They are going to great expense to set up a great distribution system and a great brand name that will be nearly impossible to compete against. As matts1213 explains, higher margins could get their p/e down to around 30. That's an earnings yield of about 3%, which isn't bad in this low yield environment. 

I still think it's overvalued like crazy. There are too many variables that could go wrong. But, it's interesting to see how other investors are thinking. 

--------

&gt; Amazon is struggling at the margins. They had 13 billion in revenue during the first quarter (also, 17 billion for Q4), yet their net income was only 130 million. The p/e is based on income. The revenue will continue to grow, as they have not reached the height of their online business. However, the change in the p/e will largely come from higher margins. If they manage to get to 5%, then already the p/e becomes 36, not even counting for potential revenue growth.  ...

http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wt5ij/amazon_currently_has_a_pe_of_170_at_what_pe_ratio/c5glkg1"
2012-09-08 05:58:06,"The thing to remember is metrics like P/E's aren't valuations -- they're mental shortcuts that can be useful guides for valuing companies in particular circumstances (eg. companies with stable growth).

Amazon's a company that's growing its revenue quickly, but not its earnings. The bull case is that the company will continue to dominate online retail and grow revenue quickly for the next 4-5 years, at which time current operating margins will return to more normal levels of 4-6%. Current operating margins are depressed by significant investments in things such as new distribution centres (which aren't currently fully utilised), the Kindle Fire (most likely sold at a loss), and AWS.

So if you wanted to value Amazon, I'd ignore the one year P/E because it's largely irrelevant. More important is what it will earn in 5 or 10 years time, and if you believe high revenue growth continues and margins return to higher levels, then you can construct an earnings scenario that justifies the current price."
2012-09-08 01:56:57,"
Dividends. Drug companies, telecoms, etc. provide dividends. There are pension funds, retirees and ordinary investors that own amzn and they need income. Calpers got 1% last year and they were planning on 6% +. 

amzn p/e is over 300. They spent a lot this year on new tech so earnings got hammered. Fine. Let's say they get back around 100. That's still an earnings yield of 1%. ATT pays a dividend of 4.7%, and its stock price went up nicely to boot. 

Apparently what's happening is amzn is growing its top line at a furious rate, and analysts are figuring on 5 -10% margins off that forever, which is hoping nothing goes wrong.  But they've also got to continue to grow their earnings because other companies that couldn't continue to grow their earnings fast enough have gotten hammered. Keeping in mind that amzn had to drive its p/e into the stratosphere to keep sales up, you've got to wonder what's their next trick? Also, amzn is a glamorous company that everyone is gaga about, which also drives up the stock price. 

I love amzn, but I think it's probably far more expensive than it should be.

A better (more sane) metric may be Price to CFO ~ 30 right now. Still crazy high, but eventually the scale and the investments will pay off. Additionally, investments in higher margin content and services are expected to pay off, and turn amazon into a cash print press. When that happens, these ratios will make more sense.

Therefore it would be more advantageous to avoid losses in the first place so you don't have to find high returns to find success.

Avoidance of loss, and its close sibling investing with a margin of safety, is arguably more important than finding high returns. "

I've seen NARV used before, and will read the other two ""pillars"" of his investing approach, but if you ask me, a solid DCF in which you actually research and learn will beat out this blog's investing philosophy any day."
2012-03-19 10:12:04,"I still like DCF.  I totally concede the uncertainty of future cash flows, but IMO uncertainty is the currency that value investors trade in.  Uncertainty is where the opportunity lies, and if you can do more research than the other guy and can be more sure of your estimates, you're likely to do well.

It all comes down to the mental models that you use in your head.  I've only been doing value investing for 4 years now (before that I was still contrarian but had no system) so DCF is a great tool for me, although I typically also try to triangulate on a valuation using other methods.  There are definitely companies that are impossible to value using DCF, but i just skip them for now."

2012-03-18 22:58:35,"This is something I've dealt with in my personal investing. I haven't gotten burned but I know better now. If you find yourself tempted to sell after a 10% gain you should perhaps re-evaluate how you are calculating intrinsic value. You might find that your intuition is telling you to sell because you know the assumptions you used to calculate IV were too favorable.

If you find after looking again at your calculations of IV that you still agree with your underlying evaluation then I'd say it is better to not try to play these little gains. Eventually you are going to miss a big movement up and it wont have been worth it.

As for buying on dips, I think this is just prudent investing. I never fill a position on a single day. If fundamentals aren't changing I'll usually wait for a down day every few weeks and add to a position. Phillip Fisher talks about this in common stocks and uncommon profits. He is less concerned with hitting local minima as he is talking about how steady periodic purchases produce less risky entry than single full position entry."

2012-03-17 15:21:55,"The biggest flaw is that you don't know when the maxima or minima will be hit. Your thesis is stating that you think it should be valued at $5. How do you know if it drops to a $1 one day and for some reason it bounces back up to $6 and the market corrects itself. 

I have noticed that the stock market is pretty quick at recognizing fair value once it is ""known"". Market opportunities can exist for less than a week and then the gap closes. Just take a look at Netflix. It dropped from $100 to $70 in a week and within a week bounced back to over $100. Not to say Netflix was under/over/fairly valued, but just think about that."
2012-03-17 15:13:44,"You are right.....because of the difference in taxes my original scenarios are flawed, in order for my original idea to work, which I would only use it during huge single day type jumps, for it to be a good decision I would have to make an EXTRA 3% by reinvesting profits back into same company (tax difference BECAUSE 20% jump with 15% gain penalty(15% gain penalty comes from difference between 30-15% tax rate by choosing to exit) = 3% loss of TOTAL invested capital + gains), + 2% (trades, its less but I like to be on the safe side) plus an extra...say....5% to be worth my time doing it in the first place).  So with that being said...BTC would have to fall close to or below 1.50, then me reinvest capital + gains back into it, and then it would have to rise BACK to 1.70 again for me to have made the correct decision.( Which if it falls to 1.50 for no ""reason"" then I fully expect it to be back at 1.70 and beyond down the road). 

The hole in my logic was not figuring in capital gains taxes, which are significant.

I guess the reason that I ""thought"" about doing it in the first place is because I see a lot of small cap companies flash up whenever someone takes a big stake in them, and then either dwindle, or free fall back down to normal levels within days.  This is something that seems much easier to see on a company whose avg. volume is tiny, not so much on the GEs and the Aapls.   

My biggest problem now is going to be deciding my re-entry point back into BTC now that I have left.  I'll try to use this whole thing as a learning experience, if I lose some gains, its good for me...If it works out well....hopefully the speculative move won't develop into a habit."
2012-03-17 11:51:35,"When you're dealing with marginal tax rates, you're correct--there's no situation where making more money is a tax disadvantage, since you only pay the higher rates on the part of your earnings above the threshold.

But the other posters are correct, since they are talking about the difference between [short-term and long-term capital gains tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States)--where the tax savings for holding the securities for over a year is anywhere from 10-15% at most marginal brackets.

This is totally the case.  It's tough to be disciplined and stick to your system, especially when your instinct draws you towards another style.  Generally the way people learn to trust their system is by NOT trusting their system and then counting up all the money they would have made if they would have just stuck to the plan.  That's how I learned.  

I eventually started to let go once I realized that ""the system"" made better financial decisions than ""flaming_taco_monkey"" could make on his own.  ""The system"" gave the same answers under the same conditions every time, where ""flaming_taco_monkey"" gets agitated about totally random stuff like the WTF Is Going On In Greece show that's been on TV lately, or the ""OMG This Super Rich Guy Will Ruin The Country If Elected"" reality show.

2012-03-17 00:26:44,"What you say makes total sense to me, I understand the idea that if you are ""close"" to your fair value that it would be a logical reason to go ahead and leave, especially if you had another juicy prospect lined up on deck, and I would have to say that would be a logical move to make seeing as how after the 35% jump that your original stock made that it now would have much more downside than before, while the company you have on deck could be much more undervalued at that specific point in time, resulting in much more upside than the original position.

What I am doing is somewhat similar, with the only difference being that I STILL see the original stock as very undervalued, and would have to say it's still in my ""top 2"" in terms of most attractive prospects, even after it's violent spike up.

Ultimately the goal is to maximize gain, while still considering downside and ESPECIALLY learning good habits as I am a new investor wanting to get started the right way......strict, cold hard logical decision making seems to be the most difficult part of value investing.....unfortunately from what I can tell the only real commonality between gambling and investing is that sometimes bad habits are rewarded, which makes them that much harder to break once they develop."
2012-03-17 00:05:55,"I sold out a little earlier than maybe a strict adherence to my system would have suggested.  I figured double digit returns in a few weeks wasn't something to turn down so I took my profit and moved on.  My wife actually held on and kept building her position, and she's now doing pretty nicely for herself with that company.

I only ask because in my case $1.73 is by no means the destination (fair value), but the extreme jump (20+% in one day) while pleasant, seemed like....too much too soon, I guess is the best way I know to put it, and that's what caused me to start the chain of thoughts I outlined above, whether they are good or bad I guess I'll see, but the overall reason I even posted about it to begin with is that I don't want to develop bad habits early on in my investing life.  Sometimes bad habits can be rewarded (gambling), it still makes them bad habits.  However there is a difference between calculated risk, and to me the risk I took seems to have more positive or neutral consequences than it does negative, and by negative I mean ""less positive"" instead of net negative."

A few weeks later, the cash found its way through the accounting meatgrinder and wound up showing up as a great EPS.  Guys jumped all over it and I was happy to sell at a 35% gain after holding it for maybe 4 or 5 weeks.

2012-03-16 21:10:57,"What if say, the security jumps 20% in a day?.....I was trying to speak in hypotheticals, however the specific situation would possibly paint a more correct picture.

I bought BAC at 1.40 a while ago.  Today it jumped to 1.70, at which point my thought process was, 20ish% in one day? and due to theonly reason that I can tell, is someone bought a LOT of it...(which could mean someone/several people agree with me about its value, maybe not) However, this is much more volume than normal, and there were no earnings reports revealing to the P/E, EPS watchers what I've already witnessed in their Financial Statements.  Thus this is not the catalyst I had envisioned as being the reason it reached its fair value of 3$+ per share.  So I sold it at 1.70, had it been a 5%, even 10% increase I wouldn't have thought about trying to enter/exit/enter, however at 20% I had enough in the position that entry/exit/enter commisions weren't enough to really eat into the actual gains that much.  (we're talking hundreds of dollars not thousands btw).  It closed 1.73, and I could very well be missing out on some gain if it doesn't pullback
and continues going aggressively up.  However due to the violence of the rise and somewhat volatile nature of the security I chose to take a calculated risk. 9Bird in hand is two in bush type stuff)

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES: 

1) If it goes back down, I invest original capital plus the gains back in and wait for catalysts to happen which SHOULD cause it to continually rise to its fair value, (Best Case). (I WIN!) 

2) Or it could continue to rise at which point I have to make a speculative decision based on two possible scenarios...
2A) Is it truly on its way to being fairly valued? If so and I re-enter on the ""uptrend"" I lose out on the gains from the time period I wasn't invested in the stock. (I WIN LESS) 
2B) The other would be, is this a continuation of a normal ""mr. market"" spike, (in which case it could snap back and eat into/eliminate the gains I got from cashing out when I did?). (ITS A WASH)  In this case the result would be no different if I had just let it sit(except commissions), so is it really a negative move?  I would think it would be a wash in terms of consequences to just holding the stock in the first place.  

So in my mind, one outcome I Win Bigger, One outcome I lose some gains (Win Less), and one outcome is a wash in terms of my move versus letting it sit.  All scenarios share the same fate as letting it sit except for the scenario where I win Less.

These scenarios of course do not take into consideration trade commissions, however in this case, that penalty while there, is minimal.  Thus in my mind the obvious choice in my calculated risk was to act as I did.  Sometimes I tend to ""overthink"" things, and this may be an example of that, there also may be a scenario/outcome I am missing here,  if anyone sees a hole in my logic that I have missed please let me know.   As always I appreciate any comments/insight.    "
2012-03-16 19:55:38,"I'll add that you have to be right very often to make the more active strategy pay off.  If you just let it ride, in addition to the lower frictional trading costs and lower taxes, you only have to be right 1 time.

There's nothing that says you can't do it, it just seems like a lot of work for little (to potentially negative) returns.  If you're good enough at ""trading the squiggles"", you might want to just do that.

If you're looking to generate extra returns from your investment, covered calls are probably a better addition to a value investing strategy.

Edit:  There are no ""taboos"" and no style points awarded.  Well, maybe the only taboo is getting into something that you don't understand."
2012-03-16 18:17:41,"It's not worth the money. Cause you'd be paying a lot of commission fees every time you buy and sell the stock. In addition, if you don't hold on to a stock for more than a year, any gain on that will be taxed at a higher rate.

For those of you not sure if you want to spend the time on 15 pages of white paper, here's a choice excerpt:
&gt;The returns-based approach skips the two steps of reliability and validity and goes directly to the 
results. It doesn’t pause to ask: what leads to excess returns? It just measures the outcome. This 
approach works in fields where skill determines results and luck is no big deal. For example, if 
you have five runners of disparate ability run a 100-yard dash, the outcome of the race is a highly 
reliable predictor of the next race. You don’t need to know anything about the process because 
the result alone is proof of the difference in ability."

The figure was down 208, or 23% from a year ago. The lower rig count isn't seriously denting record gas output because oil drilling continues to climb sharply. The number of oil rigs in use is up 61% from a year ago. About one-third of U.S. gas output comes from wells that primarily produce oil and they have been running flat out, with crude prices entrenched at prices well above $100 a barrel, traders said.""

Using the CAMEL method in part two, the bank scored an 8.2 out of ten, in terms of solvency.  The one lagging area in which they scored somewhat poorly was the NPA/Assets category, currently scoring a (3) and that ratio has shown steady improvement quarter by quarter.  Their overal ""solvency score"" coupled by the fact that they are not over exposed in high risk loan markets, their CEO, who has been in his position for a year, has taken them from the deep Red, back into the black.....and with all previous research as well, I just cant find a reason in which they are not undervalued....I'm just going to have to pull the trigger, if its a mistake Ill just go back and try to see what I've overlooked.

New Residential

The first company on the list is not a new one. I have owned Newcastle Investments, from which New Residential was spun-of in the middle of May, for about a year and a half now. New Residential got hit very hard by the REIT sell-off, falling from a high of above $7 to just a few cents over $6. Unfortunately this was a situation where $6.75 looked good to me, $6.50 looked better and $6.25 even better, so I was buying all the way down and, rather than catching the bottom, I caught a falling knife, and ended up with an average a cost of around $6.55."

Another famous Buffett quote (which I think comes from the discussion of ABC/Capital Cities in one of his letters) is along the lines that a really good franchise will still have enviable performance even if it is run by the owner's shiftless and backward nephew. Of course the performance will be better with excellent management.

Edit: the docs you originally requested are all for understanding the company during the restructuring - particularly useful if you want to invest in the debt or equity as a 'vulture' and aim to get either repaid during the process, or receive securities issued and distributed to pre-restructuring securityholders.  However, legal expertise is just as, if not more, important than investing expertise during this process.  You can ride on the coat-tails of hedge funds, but they get it wrong sometimes too."

2013-06-25 17:04:28,"From the article:  *""I thought there was a good chance margins would improve (at that time Katherine Graham began to focus her attention on improving operations)""*

I bet the only reason margins improved was that Buffett got on the board and tactfully taught Kay Graham how to run the business.  I bet the reason this bargain existed was because the market was assuming that the controlling shareholders were more focused on journalism that profits.  Since Graham held special voting shares and couldn't be removed from her management position by a regular shareholder vote, the market assumed that this dire situation would continue indefinitely.  It took a special person like Buffett to change that situation, so to suggest that a regular shareholder could have earned those returns without someone like Buffett getting involved is inaccurate in my opinion.  I think his Coke investment was similar - he bought a bunch of stock, used his powers of persuasion to get on the board and convinced them to stop the dumb price war they were having with Pepsi.  "

2013-06-25 13:13:11,"Thanks, and yes I was also thinking of the future rate implications or previously low finances, I am using WACC for a discount rate to value future cash flows &amp; economic profit calculation. It may also be useful in assessing financial leverage, although I have no model for it currently. Do use the W/A rate for the cost of debt from the 10K footnote as the cost of debt?

Cheers and thanks for the help. "
2013-06-25 12:15:17,"Here's a very simple example of what I do to calculate the cost of debt:  [link to pic](http://i.imgur.com/4wAEHeJ.png)

Just go to the company's debt footnote and they should at least have the individual debt issues broken down into date of maturity, amount raised, and the rate.  Take a weighted average of those to get the company's overall cost of debt.  I use this to forecast out changes in the company's overall debt from year to year, not to calculate WACC because I usually only use cost of equity in my valuations.  If you're going for an accurate WACC you will probably want to understand at what rate the company can borrow in a ""normal"" interest rate environment; you don't want to artificially deflate the WACC because the company happened to have just had a big issuance at a historically low interest rate.

BTW, what are you using WACC for?"
2013-06-25 11:43:20,"Sure,  for example valuation techniques.  When I first started learning about investing most books talked about how you needed to value the company before you bought it but they generally didn't show you how to do the valuations.  The only valuation that I found easily was the asset reproduction valuation.  It took me years to find some of the valuations I use now.

I will talk about many valuation techniques in the book, show everyone how to do them, what the terms in the valuations mean, and how to adjust the numbers for yourself.

The book is aimed at beginning to intermediate level value investors."
2013-06-25 11:28:49,"thank you 5-year beta may seem most appropriate. So you use the YTM on the most recent debt as an assumption for the entire debt pile? I understand 10% WACC is a great starting point and average but through my calculations I have found companies ranging from 8-15% and can alter the future cash flows (especially terminal) with a large variance. 

The sensitivity table is a great idea, thanks! "

2013-06-25 00:43:38,"If you have a long time horizon, there's really nothing that will give you a forward view of a stock's volitility.  I'd just use the 60 month beta and take that as a starting point - value your cashflows using a sensitivity table as opposed to finding ""the one"" cost of equity figure.

For cost of debt I try to keep it simple and just calculate the debt outstanding and applicable rates from the debt footnote in the most recent 10K/Q."
2013-06-24 22:34:52,"The weighted average cost of capital is suppose to represent the required rate of return for an investor.  You don't have to value the entire firm. You can always calculate free cash flow to the equity holders and discount it by your required rate of return.

Warren Buffet always said to just use 10% - which simply meant he wanted at least a 10% return on his capital before making an investment.

Anyway, to directly answer your question you should look at beta forecasting which is done by Barra through a method of correlation forecasts. "

That is partially the reason. The other is the choice investors have between bond yields and stock yields. As the risk/return tradeoff improves for bonds, stocks lose some appeal.

"
2013-06-23 21:47:04,"The Fed buying bonds injects capital into the financial system via banks and keeps rates low to encourage risk capital to be used for business ventures (to create jobs, stimulate the economy, etc.).  Slowing the ""gas pedal"" or stopping this program will 

* increase interest rates
* increase bond yields (because bond yields are dictated from a combination of the yield on treasuries (which is dictated from the Fed Funds Rate, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve, and a risk level associated with the bonds -- assumed to be unchanging)
* stocks will, more than likely, be hurt because there is a fear that the injection of capital into the economy is the only reason the economy has been doing well, and that by changing this, the economy isn't strong enough to support current valuations
* housing prices will be probably be hurt by the increase in interest rates, for the same reason that bonds will (as home mortgages are fundamentally similar to bonds)
* Commodity prices will likely be affected relative to the ""cost of carry"" of the specific commodity.  The reasoning behind this is that an investor has to pay interest on holding the commodity being traded (i.e. oil is very expensive in this regard), and will be hurt that way.  The actual value of commodities will likely be unchanged.

I understood it intuitively, by looking at capex and free cash flow, but if you had asked me why a $1 of free cash flow from Ford is worth less than the equivalent from Colgate, I wouldn't have had a good reason. Relatedly, I had no understanding of the importance of working capital, and how large working capital needs can destroy a good business, and how that affects valuation. That may be due to my own lack of formal business education, but it took me a long time, and reading many investing books, to figure that out.

2013-06-20 20:40:58,"I have thought about writing a book titled ""How to Analyze 10K's: Value Investing in the Real World"". 

But then I realized there were some problems.

* I have to compare 3-5+ years worth of 10K's for each company.
* Explain how the company evolved over that time, usually coming up with a story.
* Explain why the company had intrinsic value that was durable over time.
* Explain why the stock was cheap **at the time**.

Now this last one is tricky, because most stocks **look** fairly valued, unless it's a microcap net-net or something like that. Only in hindsight (or with a good foresight) does stocks look cheap. For example, was AIG at $40 cheap in early 2011? How about at $25 in late 2011? How about now?

So after all that work, I still wanted to say something like ""This will work only 40% of the time. You just have to take my word that 400 batting average is really awesome"".

And then I ask myself
* I'm not doing anything that every other value investor is doing.
* I'd rather be reading 10K's, not writing books about them.

And then I realized Warren Buffett's favorite quote ""Buy great companies at a reasonable price"" summed up my entire hypothetical book.

2016-05-31 14:46:23,"Sounds like the rights themselves are outstanding:

    ""the Board declared a non-taxable dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of the Company's common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2016""

but the rights are only exercisable once someone buys &gt;= 4.99% of the common (and they would be exercised automatically):
      
    ""The issuance of rights ... cause(s) a significant dilution upon any person or group that acquires ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions""

My understanding is that the company would exercise everyone's rights BUT the 5% s/h's rights, which would dilute the 5% owner.


I don't think I'd get too caught up in the details of this. Nothing really changes in the capital structure for now and anyone w/ enough money to buy 5% of the company would typically have at least a conversation or two w/ the company b/f they got to that point and they'd understand the implications of their actions.

I would assume the first category was just intrinsically cheap companies and the second category was cheap relative to other companies of the same type.  The first category is fairly self-explanatory.  However, you can imagine a company that isn't necessarily that cheap to take out value, but is cheaper than all the other ones in its category.  I.e., Buffett might not think it is very cheap to how much it was worth (or maybe not a ""steep"" discount), but does think it is the cheapest of a group (i.e., if it were priced with the group, it would be valued higher).  

I imagine he would advise not to pay attention to that second category if you asked him now though."

2016-05-30 17:39:22,"In general, any widely-used model for valuing the equity of a bank or bank holding company implicitly assumes that their assets of the bank are essentially *normal* since they all assume the target's portfolio is of average type, duration, concentration, allocation, ect. If any of these factors vary from their peer averages by a significant amount (say 2+ stnd dev) then **you should definitely address these factors individually**. A complete analysis should explain why the model is still valid or why your model adjs make your estimate sufficiently valid.

There are a lot of potential situations given bank size, deposit mix/size, country, ect that may make the above impossible. I would still try to acknowledge them. As for data, you really need to give more info for applicable advice. I think there are 30+ distinct markets there"

However, I think Buffett recommends the golden rule #1 Don't lose money because most investors (individual and institutional) don't realize how costly a severe loss to principal is to long-term returns. See example #1 below.
That's a long-winded way of saying that I think Buffett's writing/quotes are extremely useful, but you need to decipher them from his POV and apply them to your situation. They are definitely open to a wide-range of interpretations.

2016-05-29 10:34:09,"Besides the excellent points made by /u/LetsTalkMarkets, I tend to look at the principle he is communicating to be: put a value to your own time as well.  

Some industries make immediate sense to us by virtue of our experiences and/or background.  We may need to study a lot to understand other industries.

The time you take to get caught up with a new industry is a cost that you must bear.  Making investments in industries that you already understand however means that you are maximizing your ability to get a return on the time you would spend on them."
2016-05-29 10:31:22,"&gt; If the market discount rate is 15% wouldn't we want to look for P/E below 6.6 to justify taking the risk? 

Yes, I would require a margin of safety.

&gt; I guess this is where I am confused, considering such high growth expectations to justify the p/e at this point wouldnt it be considered growth investing?

Its just an example of the relationship between P/E and growth. If you pay a high P/E than ask the reverse question: At a such a P/E the company has to grow 11% until infinity? The long term macro productivity gain is just 3% so the 11% are not sustainable. It has to grow faster than 11% up until a point in the future and than 3%  until infinity. Is that realistic?

&gt; Correct me if I am wrong to justify that P/E there is not a lot of room for multiple expansion and the only way that you would stand to profit would be dependence on the continued growth and subsequent price increase of the security based on that growth.

yes you are right. If you buy at high P/E you already brought future growth, which has yet to realize!

Growth investing can be value investing, but not all growth investing is value investing. Think about this example of uncertain growth: A bank in Silicon Valley provides debt for start ups. It issues debt conservatively to start-ups and requires collateral and (some) options in the the start up it finances. The bank is fairly valued at ~1.1 P/B. 2 cases can happen. The start ups go bankrupt and the bank gets collateral, resulting recovering the debt and resulting in no change of the P/B. 2nd case, the start ups grow and get sold, than the bank gets the options paid out. In that case the bank should be valued higher than 1.1 P/B. So even if you buy at fair 1.1 P/B, it can be a value investing, because the risk is very small whereas the gains are enormous.

&gt;  discount rate is the risk one is paid for taking on the security vs more secure equities

Yes, the discount rate = risk free rate + equity risk premium. For less secure companies you require a higher equity risk premium which results in a higher discount rate. The risk free rate does not change.

&gt;  intelligent investor 

In my opinion every value investor should have read it, but it is basically irrelevant right now. There are not many NetNets out there. There are much better books out there: ""Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond (Wiley Finance)"", ""The Little Book That Builds Wealth"", ""The Little Book of Valuation: How to Value a Company, Pick a Stock and Profit"", ""Deep Value: Why Activist Investors and Other Contrarians Battle for Control of Losing Corporations"", Read yourself into the concept of ROIC and being able to calculate it based on an annual report given to you."

2016-05-28 15:57:04,"Absolutely and I think there's are really useful (maybe important) points to make. I think my strategy used to be riddled with hidden risks that consistently caused me to underperform when expected returns and my research process was incredibly inefficient.

Maybe I did a bad job but I was hoping to convey that I think a large portion of returns for an investor of individual stocks is due to where they choose to expand their competence (research). No matter how analysts one has, decision makers can only have a limited percentage of the available, useful equity-related information. Investment research has uncertainty properties. The more in-depth you research a company, the smaller your circle of competence (""CC""). The minimum time to broaden your CC =&gt; understanding everything is impossible. I think another reason WEB avoided uncertain or poor-return industries is due to the limitations on time and the time required to adequately understand.

An individual investor can probably keep up with no more than 100 companies, assuming they put ~40 hours/week into the endeavor (time it takes to read reports, company-related news, create model, ect). Most can probably only handle 10-20. If your time is severely limited, assuming one adequately researches an investment, why would someone focus on companies they *can't* hold for at least a few years? If you lower your business-, industry-, or management-quality standards then you can safely assume that some meaningful % of companies you research *shouldn't* be invested in (if that's 50% then think if all the inefficient research hours!).

I personally follow roughly 50 companies very closely, another 100 companies on a high-level, conversant, basis. All have top-quintile-type business models and are in attractive industries. I occasionally invest in Graham-style deep value stocks. I research them in a one-off basis and have very high standards (most of them I research, I turn down - so they really aren't very helpful to overall returns). 

I have been sticking to this research process/methodology for 4+ years and I think it has had a substantial effect on returns (I make that judgement based on the quality of my returns, accuracy/hit-rate, ect)."

2016-05-28 15:36:29,"Thanks for the detailed reply. And I think you're right about Buffett's definition of ""understand"" being more about the inability to confidently project cash flows out 5-10 years.

But even still, when we know that Buffett reads some of the same annual reports every year (he said he read Anheiser Busch for 35 years before buying a share) that there have to be some publicly traded companies that he just doesn't look at right? Even a 10-Q is 100 pages, so if all you did was just read one 10-Q from all 4,000 stocks traded on the NYSE, then you'd read 400,000 pages per year, which is &gt; 1,000 pages per day. So if he's averaging 80 pages per day, that means he's **not** reading a majority of the SEC fillings. I know this is kind of a silly point, but we still have to acknowledge that there is just way too much information out there to even touch 1% of it, you have to pick and choose where to devote your time.

2016-05-28 14:47:30,Insurance is not hard to understand operationally. Brk's strength is mostly in capital discipline. The problem is that for non standard policies you just have to take the management's words about their book of risk.

"
2016-05-28 13:27:57,"Thanks once again for your thoughtful and comprehensive response.  I am still trying to grapple with all the valuation metrics and their interconnections.
  Lets assume that the cost of capital is Zero for the sake of this conversation and that the ROIC is 15%. The total assets are $100. Now if the market price for the security is is $375 giving it a p/e of 25 with earnings of $15. 

&gt;  Lets assume for simplicity that Earnings is equal to Owners Earnings. The ROIC tells me that the company generates 15% long term on my assets (after maintenance capex and no growth) which equals the market discount rate of 15%. With a market discount rate of 15% than we have a P/E of 6.6 (1/15%) and we are indifferent to invest or not.

If the market discount rate is 15% wouldn't we want to look for P/E below 6.6 to justify taking the risk? 
&gt; Now we add growth for the next year to justify P/E 25: 25/6.6 = 380%. Now the company has to grow until next year by 380% and then no growth to justify its 25 P/E (without additional capital) or 11% yearly growth until infinity (DCF Terminal Value: 25 = 1/(15%-11%)) or 100% the next year and then around 9.5% until infinity. Do your DCF experiments here. Get fluent with shifting growth back and forth the years.

I guess this is where I am confused, considering such high growth expectations to justify the p/e at this point wouldnt it be considered growth investing? Correct me if I am wrong to justify that P/E there is not a lot of room for multiple expansion and the only way that you would stand to profit would be dependence on the continued growth and subsequent price increase of the security based on that growth. 
&gt;A second source of high multiple is the discount rate. To justify an P/E of 25 just use a discount rate of 5% and growth until infinity of 1% and then you justified an P/E of 25 = 1/(5%-1%).
Traditionally the discount rate is defined as discount rate = risk free + equity risk premium. As central banks suppress risk free rate to 0% and below all the multiples get distorted. Investors chase yield thereby suppress equity risk premiums even further. The whole (market) discount rate is very distorted right now.


So the discount rate is the risk one is paid for taking on the security vs more secure equities. Where it makes perfect sense to apply 15%. If I do that a P/E of 7.14 makes sense assuming 1% growth (PE 7.74=1/(.15-.01)). 

I guess what I am confused about after reading the intelligent investor is that historically equity returns have been due to the underlying increase in price of the security vs the yield compared to bonds. If I am already paying handsomely for growth that may or may not occur coupled with p/e ratio that may not provide a lot of room for expansion I would think that I am buying the security at a premium where I am unlikely to see large gains and where I am taking on a number of additional risks that I am not being compensated for adequately. "
2016-05-28 13:18:07,"Buffett said he read the 10Ks of IBM for fifty years before 'getting it'. 

The quote, in my view, is more about understanding competitive advantages. You don't need to understand the engineering behind a carrier's network to understand the value of its business. 

And your circle of competence will be different from someone's else. I agree with you on oil. Too complex for me and too many risks I'm too uncertain about. "
2016-05-28 12:51:55," I think the overarching factor is that time is a commodity and it really comes down to opportunity costs. Buffett and Munger have been doing this for so long; so they know what industries are in their circle and what isn't, simple as that.


Personally, I don't see its as valuable to look into these more complex industries (a la oil/semi-conductors). When there are soooo many other stocks to look at (with much simpler business models), that offer a good risk/reward, or better.

Buffett reads 10k's/q's as well as newspaper (WSJ, FT) and relevant trade magazines (American Banker, Forbes) everyday. Probably has read the Netflix 10K, but I'd be surprised if he actually did an in-depth analysis beyond face value. "

2016-05-28 12:12:27,"My recommendation is to think in absolute $. You get a much better feeling for a business. An essential is to learn P/L, balance sheet and CF dynamics. P/E relates P/L and market price. P/B relates balance sheet and market price. FCF/P ... you get it. But each metric only tells you a part of the whole story. You want to understand the full story; understand the dynamics.

P/E 25 = 4% yield, P/E 17 = 6%, P/E 6.6 = 15%

(I hope I do not mess up stuff here. Correct me if I am wrong.)

Buffett uses a risk free rate of at least 2%. I use 15% as discount rate always, just to eliminate distortions based on suppressed discount rate at the moment. My 15% is wrong because it does not adjust for different risk levels across companies, whereas the market discount rate likely understates the actual risk because central banks set risk free rate at 0% and below and flood the market with printed money.

So if a company does a secondary offering, they're selling their treasury stock back onto the market?

Edit: Also, you can ""cancel"" shares instead of keeping them in treasury stock?"
2016-05-28 10:20:27,"Thank you for your reply. It is extremely informative. So if it passes all your screens and you end up with an ROIC of 15% after tax. However the shiller P/E of the company is at 25. Historically this industry has a shiller P/E of 17. How would you maintain a margin of safety considering that the even though the ROIC and growth, which are uncertain predictions of the future, look promising the stock is priced outside of the historical mean.

2016-05-28 09:11:46,I don't trust guys in suits. Especially ones selling derivatives.
2016-05-28 08:56:54,puh... quite a long answer!
2016-05-28 08:56:33,"Really good questions! In short, I do not compare multiples for *valuation* proposes. For valuation I use absolute Dollars. 

The goal is to know the following: $1 invested in stocks of the company results in $0.63 equity ownership and generates $0.13 Owner Earnings of which $0.03 is used in for debt service, $0.01 for dividends and $0.09 for growth investments at 15% ROIC. Next year, your equity ownership is $0.72 (= $0.63 + $0.09) and generates $0.1435 (= $0.13 + $0.09 * 15%) Owner Earnings which $0.03 for debt service (interest and repay remained constant the next year), $0.01 for dividends (remained constant too) and left $0.1035 for growth investments at 15% ROIC rate. IF the customer market saturates and cannot deploy more capital, the ROIC decreases eventually.

How to get there? My key metric is return on invested capital (ROIC). I use an approximation for ROIC while screening. For valuation I calculate the real ROIC manually by correcting for of accounting charges and making assumptions. If a company has an ROIC &gt;= 15% its likely a good company. The next question I try to answer is ""is the high ROIC long term sustainable and why?"". Based on the ROIC, balance and market price I can calculate what is a $1 investment worth in this compnay in 1..5..10 year (this is rather difficult; lots of assumptions have to be made; just stay conservative). What is reinvested in the business and thus compounded by ROIC? what is paid out? When is the market saturated? What happens to the cash flow when crisis hit? Debt has to be paid, but liquidity might be short. What does the management do when it cannot deploy any more capital?

I do compare competitor multiples during valuation (not screening), just to see if some competitor is better than ""my"" company and therefore a better investment. Also interesting is walking up (suppliers) and down (customers) the supply chain."
2016-05-28 08:52:37,"(1) Enterprise value = all the capital injected (equity) and lended by the various stakeholders, or what it would (in theory) cost to duplicate the business (how much capital you would have to line up).

Liabilities inherited from the Macondo incident shouldn't be included in your calculcation. It's a debt indeed, but it isn't capital invested in order to generate a return. 

(2) Common shares authorized = the maximum amount of shares a company can sell. Par value can be any price.

Treasury stock = shares bought back by the company, and thus removed from the equity (= capital injected by shareholders in the business). 

If they're in treasury, it means they haven't been cancelled. It's your job to figure out why (can be to pay management, which isn""t nice to shareholders, or to be used as a currency for future acquisitions)."

Maybe look at the prior 2-3 year earnings trend and apply that into your calc"
2017-03-11 21:12:38,"Because we're in a subreddit for the topic, I'll bring up an additional point.

At some price, I think it also depends on the equity and how you valued it. For example, back in 2009 and 2010, there were many more net-nets than I anticipate there are today. (I don't follow them any more) With many, you could do a calculation of cash in the bank, minus all liabilities, and the market cap was less than the result. 

If you own the entire firm (and that's how Ben Graham taught us to think), then it's a great approach. If you only own a portion, however, and don't have control, you have to count on the firm to do what's best - operate the company if it's worthwhile, or shut it down and liquidate the assets to shareholders. It's very rare that companies shut down early on when the decline is starting based on my experience. 

So my only point is this - in certain circumstances, I think price obviously matters, but you might also have to include an element for the volume as well. If you can get a controlling stake, then that increases your exit strategy options."

2017-03-11 15:45:59,"found this which includes some links and excerpts to SI, including this interesting bit about Buffett:


&gt; Which brings me to the my third point, well-noted in Wall Street On Sale. Buffett's buy-and-hold philosophy is his third incarnation, which comes of necessity due to the size requirement on his investments. And his absolute best years - the ten years of his partnership- were not of the buy-and-hold type. He was very successful flipping small caps for rather quick gains when he was able. I'm sure he would love to now if it would make any difference to him. Then again, with the REITs, maybe he did.

&gt; Could it be that by investing as Buffett does now, despite our tiny size, we are giving up the inherent advantage of being an individual, small investor?

2017-03-10 13:11:20,"Having read a number of those deal prospectuses myself, I can tell you that the skill set needed there is credit analysis &amp; deal structuring, not securities law.  You can be quite sure that all those subprime RMBS and CDO^2 were securities-lawyered tighter than a duck's asshole.

I don't wish to discourage you from learning securities law; it's valuable to acquire more of a generalist skill set and know what's going on in the big wide world.  However, while I probably grok more securities law than average, I haven't found that terribly helpful in directly making me more money.

The way you'd monetize a knowledge of securities law would be in a litigation-focused strategy, and you'd be unqualified in that arena unless you were an actual professional specialist.

Maybe I'm just thick-headed though.  How exactly can I go about getting an edge in investing through knowledge of securities law?"

I made it through two phone interviews and then they gave me the personality test. I answered it honestly and was informed I wasn't a good fit. They provided me with full test results and explained why. Although upsetting, I'm content with their decision.

&gt;But the credit creation has limits and the cost of credit (interest rates) must be carefully monitored so that borrowers (think subprime) can pay back the monthly servicing costs. If rates are too high (and credit as a % of GDP too high as well), then potential Lehman black swans can occur. On the other hand, if rates are too low (and credit as a % of GDP declines), then the system breaks down, as savers, pension funds and insurance companies become unable to earn a rate of return high enough to match and service their liabilities."
2017-03-09 22:44:00,"The increase from 2015 to now seems way too dramatic to represent actual borrowing by companies that need the capital.

Apple has roughly 250bn in cash and 70bn in debt. That could have been 180bn in cash and 0 debt. 

Now, Apple is a dramatic example. But other large companies are doing the same thing. Traditional debt/equity ratio's don't make a lot of sense when the equity is in a large part cash and the company earns ridiculous cash flows relative to equity.

You should measure net debt/free cash flow instead. "

Anybody who works at Bridgewater knows that it's a really odd and demanding culture which actively promotes confronting and breaking down emotional barriers. They push people to argue about every decision and encourage holding each other to the highest possible standard.

So guess what happened: all those things. People at Bridgewater do in fact argue and push each other emotionally. Also, ExxonMobil drills for oil!

Portraying it in such a mysterious and negative way is just sensationalist. This is what they are and this is what they advertise themselves as.

2017-03-09 21:10:14,"It's a well written article, and I share his concern about current valuations.

Where he completely loses me is his way to deal with this market. Let's be honest here - if you can't outperform short term treasuries over a decade then you have no idea what you're doing.

One interesting part of his letters is that he claims to have predicted the 08 crash. That's obviously quite impressive if true, and although I haven't read his letters from back then, I have no reason to doubt this claim. He certainly seems to be very sceptical and quite thorough in his analysis.

That raises a question though: **how do you predict the greatest financial disruption of the century and NOT make money out of it?**

To me this leaves only two conclusions. (1) He was 'right' only in the sense that he was bearish all along and didn't actually predict anything. A broken clock is right twice a day. Or (2) he actually did predict the crash but was so incompetent as an investor that he couldn't actually short it in a meaningful way. 

Either way, he's a terrible asset manager. Compare this to people like Seth Klarman or Howard Marks who are just as frustrated with today's valuations but actually keep turning a decent profit and have cash on hand in case the world does burn down.

TL;DR: decent analysis, terrible money manager"
2017-03-09 20:59:25,No that's great. It's not what I've seen or heard anecdotes about though.
2017-03-09 20:46:23,"Late to the thread, but it's true that index funds generally have the best return for the risk.

What you _can_ do is leverage index funds to increase your risk and return in equal measure. You keep the same risk/reward ratio for the most part.

Check out this [hypothetical portfolio](https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/e759c8-sweet-leverage). Change the setting to ""rebalance annually"" to reduce the volatility a little (I can't save that setting for some reason).

For index funds, leverage between 2x and 3x is usually pretty safe. 5x is probably too far. You wouldn't want a flash crash to completely wipe out your portfolio."

The conclusions seem weak to me though; I wouldn't give you my money to invest though if you were interviewing for a portfolio manager type position. If you were and I was a portfolio manager, I'd probably hire you (assuming none of the other interviewees were better) and retrain you if you demonstrated that were up for that. 

Traditionally, hedge funds short stocks when they're able to long other stuff as well--if you pulled enough public similar healthcare growth companies and could long those, while proving that $TDOC is the worst of bunch, I'd consider trading on that idea. However, if you're pushing a only short idea, I need something more like a fraud (e.g. Enron) or a likely forever unprofitable business model issue (e.g. Twitter) to even consider short selling (I'm a retail investor so I have almost zero interest in ever short selling as I rationally value my money and therefore rarely am willing to take unlimited downside risk for limited gains). I doubt either exists here--it's just a company that's grown tremendously because the idea behind the business model has potential (lower costs through not-new/not-innovative but very cheap and widely available technology as to increase access to care in hopes it betters outcomes) and there may not be other public competitors or better investment opportunities at this time so that money would want to move there. 

If you see any public or private firms that connect customers to primary doctors and with a primary focus on quality of care, I'd love to see that. I'd definitely want to invest or use them as a customer if a good one exists. The idea behind One Medical gets close to a great service but they're only solving the smaller flaws in healthcare delivery. I think one of the key problems in healthcare is that we overpay surgeons/other specialty doctors and underpay primary doctors so talent more often flows to surgery rather than to primary doctors and/or don't have service providers/systems that enable them to deliver better quality of care (why can't they just provide a set time period in their days to leave open for walk-ins so they can address basic infectious diseases and cure them sooner so they don't spread...and give you the appropriate treatment onsite versus sending me to a pharmacy...gee, thanks...let me go cough up my infection to everyone else on my way there...you're welcome everyone else! also, please don't ask me to sign into some stupid ""innovative"" technology platform so I can check my medical records that only work for that particular doctor. Offer to email and/or print a copy for me and even better, work with other specialists to get copies of their data so long as you have my permission so I don't have to do it my f-ing self.). sorry for the rant at the end there...

A spinoff I've been keeping an eye on recently is Conduent. It spun off from Xerox. The interesting dynamics are Icahn really pushed for the spin, and now has 3 board seats of the new company. Darwin Deason had sold what basically makes up this division to Xerox originally in 2006 for $6 billion, some in cash and some in shares of Xerox. When this spinoff was announced he filed a lawsuit that he wanted preferred shares of the spin, since that is what he thought was valuable. He won and was subsequently given $140m worth of the spinco in preferred shares. So I find it interesting that he went to such trouble to get a piece of it. The spin co was about 3 billion whereas the company is about 7.5 billion market cap. The only thing that I don't like is Conduent feels like a turnaround, rather than a great spin story.

The analysts that give good ratings have their phone calls answered by management, they're called upon during earnings calls. If they give a sell rating or downgrade sometimes they don't get their calls/emails returned and aren't allowed in the queue on the calls.

Ultimately their job is to give buy ratings so their company (the brokers) sell more shares of the stocks they follow which gives the broker more in commissions.

It may hold up for some people investing in the index as well as mutual funds, but if you measure individual opportunity cost of each position you hold it shouldn't be a problem.  If one security, or a few, gets bumped up unrealistically vs. the rate of return; just sell it and take your profit.

He also seems to dislike DCF, as it measures FCF, which is reduced by net investment (and therefore, liquidating an asset increases the cash flow), which he argues is perverse. 

In the short term, that makes sense. But in the long term, it doesn't, as the cash flows from investing are usually there to support higher sales, and thus the return from investing in assets is reflected in revenue and, thus, in CFO. 

In short, I think he's a bit out there."

How can you talk about a drug company's earnings and ignore amortization?

2016-12-07 22:15:42,"They've changed a lot. Most notably, the meat is pre-cooked now.

&gt; We sit at a mahogany table over blueprints for a new restaurant, and Ells tells me that what’s top of mind for him is instilling safety into the company’s mind-set. ""[It’s] the hardest thing to put into place... Cultures are developed over a long period of time,"" he says. ""It has to be deeply instilled, much like our people culture or our food culture. We’re coming at this from all angles: from the supplier side, the procedures in the restaurants, things through the distribution system, training, and auditing.""

&gt; The culture Ells is most comfortable talking about is food. I ask whether the company is still living up to its Food With Integrity promise to consumers and how Chipotle precooking proteins like steak in central kitchens fits in. Ells says it’s ""misleading"" to call the steak ""precooked."" Rather, he says—his eyes peering over his narrow-framed glasses—it’s ""sous-vide."" This is the French cooking term for immersing food, sealed in a bag, in a low-temperature water bath to heat it slowly and more evenly. ""This technique was used by many chefs and still is because you can precisely control the characteristics of meat and achieve a certain kind of tenderness,"" Ells says. ""I’d say the steak is [now] more tender. It actually improves it.""

&gt; When I bring up Chipotle’s blanching of produce, Ells says it’s more akin to ""tomato concassé,"" which is a ""French term for when you blanch the tomato, cool it, and peel the skin off. It’s part of the world of classic cooking techniques."" I feel as if I’m being schooled by a judge on a cooking show (which, incidentally, Ells once was, on NBC’s short-lived America’s Next Great Restaurant).


&gt; Holland, the former Chipotle chef (who still reveres Ells), suggests that Chipotle is now selling ""smoke and mirrors,"" a kind of ""doublespeak"" that implies its new food-safety practices somehow count as classic cooking techniques. ""The moves they’re making now kind of rebut everything they’ve done in the past,"" he says.

&gt; Speaking on background, even one of Ells’s close friends agrees with this assessment. ""One of the unfortunate consequences [of the crisis] is that this wonderful fresh food, which comes with a risk, is going to be precooked, pasteurized, double- and triple-washed, all the things that you wouldn’t do [at home],"" the source contends. ""Would you rather eat [real fresh food and] take a chance on getting a case of the shits? Or would you rather have your food precooked and every possible intervention done to [it]?""

&gt; When I relay this assessment to Ells, he says, ""Nothing could be further from the truth."""
2016-12-07 22:13:05,"&gt;the 5 years Pershing held Canadian Pacific was one of their longest holdings - how long is ""long-term"" for you? How long is long-term for Ackman?

2016-12-07 21:22:46,"Thanks for posting Beren.

&gt; To estimate the intrinsic value of Chipotle shares, we have valued the discounted cash flows of the business over its life using reasonable assumptions. In our base case, we have assumed a longterm restaurant count of 5,000 units, some recovery of lost customers over the next several years, and moderate same-store sales growth over the long-term driven by the impact of new technology initiatives (like mobile, online ordering and loyalty) and day-part extension initiatives (like catering).

~~1.5~~ 2.5 times the current store count is conservative?

2016-12-07 19:10:57,"OP, a basic explanation of the valuation allowance on a DTA based on my experience is as follows:

- A deferred tax asset arises when the Company's taxable income (for tax purposes) is lower than their book income (per financial statements or SEC filings, etc.) because of a temporary difference in the accounting treatment between book and taxes (i.e. timing of expense for book purposes vs. deduction for tax purposes).  There are a variety of instances in which a DTA could arise, an NOL is just one.
- A deferred tax asset may or may not be utilized in the future depending on a variety of circumstances (this relates to the Valuation assertion of some balance sheet items).  To reflect this uncertainty in the financial statements, a Company may determine that a valuation allowance to offset the DTA balance is required.  Atleast one of which should be present for a VA **not** to be established:

1) Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences
2) Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards
3) Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law
4) Tax-planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example:
4a) Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards
4b) Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from
ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss
4c) Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments.

-Should really only be evaluated annually as constant reevaluation/reestimation of the valuation allowance can be used by management to smooth earnings (the change in the deferred tax component of income tax expense).

In summary, the removal of a DTA VA means that the Company expects to have book income in the future to offset with the DTAs."
2016-12-07 17:32:31,"I look at TTM, but don't use it for modeling personally. The business isn't likely changing a whole lot quarter to quarter, and if it is, it's probably not one I'm comfortable investing in.

I don't see a benefit making inferences from a forecasted or TTM balance sheet. Many businesses are extremely seasonal; events don't always fall in the same exact quarter, etc. For example, I know what I'm roughly worth, but it fluctuates based on when my rent is paid or when a medical bill is due or when my bonus gets paid out. It's never smooth, but you can get a good idea of worth over a few years. 

Ultimately I try not to spend too much time on forecasting since it's bound to be wrong. So I go in with pretty conservative estimates of growth, margins, and discount rate and just try to kill a company. If it's hard to kill or the downside is limited, then my interest is piqued. "

Basically, he takes the idea from a different approach: analyze the risk, and then determine what that risk demands in terms of return. 

In other words, he thinks using Beta (which he argues is difficult to truly calculate) is building speculation into the model.

It's an interesting argument. I am inclined to disagree, however. First, Beta is a quantitative measurement of the market in action, and thus gives valuable insight into the riskiness of a stock. Second, by measuring beta, you can create a standardized process across valuations that assists you in comparing and contrasting companies and industries. Lastly, it must be noted that ""accounting for riskiness"" is itself very subjective and difficult, and thus provides *more* possibility of personal bias and speculation to get into analysis than seeing what the rest of the market is thinking through Beta."

2016-12-07 14:45:02,"Seconded. I am in what should be their target demographic, but I and no one I know wears their clothes. Bebe is generally seen as trashy, not iconic in the least bit, and definitely not sexy. I agree they are a remnant of the 90s/00s era Juicy Couture phase, and they have not, nor will they likely be able to, compete with newer companies due to distribution partnerships, operations, turnaround time (Zara, Uniqlo, and H&amp;M dominate at these), and brand/design.

Isn't the number one rule in value investing (other than not losing money) that the company must have a moat? There's no moat here."
2016-12-07 14:35:19,"Wouldn't read too much into my projections here. Just meant for this to be a template for example purposes more than anything. But I'll still play ball as I have a position (though ~2/3 less than when I first bought back in Jan at $17/share). 

Historically they've been able to pass along cost increases (plus a percent or two) to customers. I haven't seen evidence to the contrary and I think management is pretty honest so no reason for me to believe otherwise.  

I agree that volume growth on their core business of snowplow is unlikely to move much. On the other hand, I don't think it's going to decline either since it's a ""need to have"" for many parts of the country. You're just not going to suddenly get a 50% increase in the number of people looking to buy snow plows. But they did acquire Henderson to enter the municipal market, and while they're the leader in that market, they only have ~25% of it. So an interesting growth opportunity, but who knows how it'll play out. 

Regarding organic growth, do mean in regards to their snow plow business? They've made some recent acquisitions that have diversified their business which has resulted in top line grow, and has probably hidden the stagnant growth of the snow plow business. But I do think these are well thought out acquisitions in adjacent markets that can eventually move the needle. This will probably come on the cost side before the sales side though. 

At $32/share, it's admittedly over my estimate of intrinsic value of ~$27, and I've trimmed my position on the way up. And yes, the level of debt they've raised for the acquisitions has made me a bit uneasy, but I'm still comfortable holding a small position for the following reasons:

* It's a predictable business
* management is solid and shareholder friendly
* there's a steady demand for their products
* it's reasonably priced
* they're moving into adjacent markets
* they've been able to cut costs / improve operations
* it's asset and operationally light
* FCF is increasing at an accelerating rate

For me, sales growth isn't really central to the thesis.

2016-12-07 10:44:34,"So few things...

Before getting into the content, your formatting needs a lot of work. Both on the blog and model. I shouldn't have to try to figure out what kind of numbers I'm looking at...for instance in your blog you switch between units in billions and millions throughout and that makes it kind of confusion to keep up, and there were some instances where you forgot a . in the numbers which made me think it was higher than it was. 

Also I'm not really understanding the logic of your model, it looks very incomplete and sloppy...is it a Martin Shkreli model? I have seen something that looks like yours before here and the consensus was it left much to be desired. 

As for your thesis, here are my qualms. 

* I do not understand how you justify growing any of your revenue drivers, especially some that you have growing 25-30% annualized. If this is a business that is competing with large competitors such as MSFT and AMZN, and has 2% share like you said, why is it still growing so fast? 
* I'm also not sure if I buy that this is a single small company competing against the titans like MSFT, AMZN, SalesForce, etc. There are TONS of small, public SaaS companies you probably could have found to compare. 
* This also makes assessing the leverage profile vs. competitors kind of meaningless, at least as you've presented it.  
* I'm not sold that they are going to default on their debt (which is what you imply throughout the write-up). If you have revenues growing, plus EBITDA margin expanding, then simply being highly levered isn't a death kiss. 
* Which leads me to not understand exactly when they are going to run into problems with their debt. A great short idea has a number of catalysts for value recognition by the market. It is generally not a good idea to short something growing at 30% with expanding margins, without a very clear catalyst no matter how yucky the balance sheet looks. Maybe they are highly levered, but what do the terms of their credit agreements say regarding issuing more debt? Could they always refinance? How much further incremental debt capacity is there on the balance sheet? 
* Also very unclear how you arrived at your valuation. In your write-up you mention that you valued it at X and thus its a short, but you didn't explain your methodology. I had to go into your model to see that you did a DCF-lite analysis, but at the start of your write-up you use EV/E (which, btw, I don't know if its EV/EBITDA or EV/EBIT) as a measure of its overpricing. I was going to see what implied EV/EBITDA multiple your model is pricing, but after digging in I can see that you did your DCF completely wrong and I can't actually audit your work (refer to my comments re: formatting). I suggest you use the self-study course provided by WallStreet Prep or something.  

Sorry if this was harsh. You post on here a lot and seem like you really want to learn so hopefully you can apply the critique going forward.

2016-12-07 08:40:39,"so most these funds have dropped ~15% with their navs down ~7% and the muni market generally down around 5%.  most are leveraged 30% accounting for the more rapid decline of their navs relative to the municipal bond market.  the leverage has two edges:  when rates are going lower (futures curve expectations), the carry is increasingly positive making the funds more desirable;  when rates are going higher, the carry is increasingly negative making them significantly less desirable.  the impact of short term rates is non-negligible, and you could envision a scenario (admittedly, rare) where short term rates were significantly higher than the yield on the portfolio taking the fund's yield significantly below that of the muni market generally (it's nav).  in such a scenario, you'd imagine the discount to be near an all-time low (each of these three funds traded at 20-30% discounts to nav during the financial crisis, with intraday lows much, much lower).  
  
tldr:  when rates were expected to stay low or go lower, these funds traded to historical premiums to nav (book).  the p/b isn't cheap on a longer term basis.  the funds are leveraged which amplifies moves relative to the muni market generally and to their navs."

They most likely marked down a ton of their assets or took a huge impairment in order to clean up their balance sheet.

2. Taxes - they are going down, making tax exempt income marginally less attractive
3. Infrastructure - often funded by muni bond issuance (increased supply)

Without going into too much detail the industry practice you essentially use short term debt to finance construction and then roll that into a LT fixed rate mortgage once the property is stabilized (i.e. producing a normalized CF based on occupancy and rent).  If you dig into the latest 10-Q, the debt schedule is disconcerting because they have a massive amount of assets in development and purported stabilized assets are still being financed with ST loans. Refinancing risk is rising in my opinion so something to consider.

Still I found these books helpful, providing vast empirical background regarding simple value heuristics.

I have to apologize though for recommending ""Quantitative Value"" before checking the current pricing on amazon. I bought mine for about 30 €. 

Since someone requested industry specific suggested reading, I recommended ""The Valuation of Financial Companies"" which provides background regarding banks and insurance companies. It is actually the only book covering this subject I have found so far.

2016-02-26 15:59:15,"I'm not familiar with how stocks are pitched for competition, but I am familiar with financial statements and valuation methods. For me:

I have no clue where you got the 3450m value of their equity for DCF. On the other side, if the PV of cash flows were 5,133m, and debt is 722m, then 4,411m would be available to 46m shares of equity = $96/share.  I also think their actual cost of debt is much lower than 8.6% (their interest expense is tiny on the financial statements, Note 7 of the financial statements shows long term lending rates of 3.00% to 4.25%).

I think comparables should be tightened, and leverage should be considered. SAIC looks juiced on leverage. A few comps look comparably leveraged with similar metrics. I believe your overall comp valuation would be lower.

You told me their WACC is 8.58% and their cost of equity is 8.3%. So why are you using 5.86% for the residual income model instead of the cost of equity? No clue how you computed your RI values either. Assumptions for growth? Is SAIC going to have residual income forever? 

Overall, I'd say keep chugging along, look closely at the 10K's 10/Q's, compare to some analyst reports, tighten up your methodology, outline what your forecasts are in valuation terms. 

I also don't know what your worst case scenario is. All the valuation metrics look on the better-case side than anything. No margin of safety.

2016-02-26 12:21:20,SAIC has been on my to-do list for a while. They have some strong competitive advantages but I won't spoil them for you ;)
2016-02-26 12:17:48,"It's both. They might name competitors but that doesn't necessarily mean the stocks are good comps. Should Ferrari trade similarly to GM? They are competitors right? Dreamworks and Disney are competitors but does that mean they should trade the same? Disney has many many businesses that are completely different than Pixar/Studio Movie Production (merchandise, amusement parks, live television in ABC/ESPN, Video games, etc). It's more about business model when you are talking about valuation. Multiples are short hand for the present value of cash flows in the business."
2016-02-26 11:58:21,"One thing on the competitors, those were the ones named in the SAIC annual presentation. Is this a good source or is there somewhere else I should look? Or is it something I really need to come up with on my own?"
2016-02-26 11:55:58,I really appreciate the feedback and taking the time to look it over. The presentation was definitely hastily done. Sources and showing more comprehensive DCF is easily done. Do you have any really good examples of a correct comparables valuation? I've looked at many articles and presentations and this is the only one that I could really grasp.
2016-02-26 11:32:51,"Here are some thoughts. Meant to be constructive, I realize this is your first time. If you are serious, you can clean this up but it will take some time imo.

* Put a simple thesis at the beginning. If someone brings me an idea, I want to know immediately is it a buy or sell and why.
* You need to cite your sources. Where are your military budget projections from? Did you just make them up?
* What is SAIC's exposure to US military vs Foreign military? If foreign, what do the economies of the biggest defense spenders look like (hint: Saudi Arabia and Russia are oil-based economies...).
* Where are your projections? How are these different from the sell side? You mention the acquisition, is this not already baked into projections? why or why not?
* I don't like DCF valuation but you don't really present anything for us to look at other than discount rate assumptions... Not sure how I can be helpful here.
* Your business/business model description is pretty shallow. I could have gotten more information off a basic factset/capital IQ tear sheet. Tell me what kind of specific IT/Engineering do they do. What kind of contracts? Who are they with? How does the company make money?
* What is this business's competitive advantage? Who are the competitors? How is it positioned? Is this just a speculative play that government military budgets are going to increase and the stock is down b/c terrorism!?
* I don't think I agree with your comp set. Yes, this is a company with government defense contracts but how much of BA or LMT is really similar to an IT services firm from a business model perspective? IT services vs gigantic tangible jets/military armaments, kind of different economics behind these businesses don't you think? Also, I don't think you can just compare a $2B company to a defense prime. That's a stretch. I think BAH is a much better comp. CACI and MANT are probably the only comps I agree with. You have NOC and CSRA in there twice.
* You throw a lot of multiples down there and just apply a premium to the stock price. Why did you choose those multiples? Which ones are better or worse? Why should the multiple re-rate? Does it occur to you that using the premium on P/E and EV/EBITDA doesn't make mathematical sense as the numerators are different?
* Why are these three valuation approaches the correct ones to use?"

The company has a projected benefit obligation of ~ 104 bn $. Equity is 40 bn. So missing projected benefit obligation estimates by 10% would translate into a 25% hit on equity. To me this does not sound excessive, but is certainly a risk to consider.

Furthermore, expected return on plan assets is ~6.3%. Plan assets in 2015 were ~74 bn $ which results in expected ~4.6 bn $ proceeds from plan assets. GM's net income was ~9.7bn in 2015."
2016-02-26 01:35:44,"A great source that I use is Morningstar. During a professional analysis however, you should do it the hard way using only SEC and broker data. "
2016-02-26 01:25:41,"Very impressed that you're 16. If you're looking to be a value investor, I'd focus a lot less on reported Net Income and more on Owner Earnings. Investigating the balance sheet of a business with a fine tooth comb is also important. What's reported is rarely accurate. For example, a company that purchases a building in 1980 for $1 million shows very little, if any, of that value in fixed assets (PPE) due to depreciation, even though it's very possible, and often the case, that the building has been well maintained and property values have significantly increased since its purchase date. What was properly maintained and purchased for $1 million could easily be valued at $10 million today. Because of GAAP recognition rules, you'd never know that unless you investigated thoroughly (county assessor records).

When you take an approach to your investments like that, you'll be in a much better position to run your own successful investment operations. At 16 years young, you're definitely on the right track. But, you have a lot of work to do. Goodluck. "

2016-02-25 20:08:03,"1. A stock may trade below book value for perfectly valid reasons. Among the most common reasons are high leverage combined with questionable asset quality (e.g. large proportion of goodwill), off-balance sheet liabilities, and lower than average long-term (!) returns on capital.

2. You have to evaluate the cash flow in the context of the company's reinvestment needs (maintenance capex). A long-term Free Cash Flow would be a more appropriate measure. Apart from that, both Free Cash Flow and Cash Flow are very volatile in the short term, while the fluctuations have almost no meaning unless you have a complete understanding of the company.

3. As glorysk87 wrote, you have to consider cyclicality of the business (affecting margins and possibly sales) and one-time effects. But as far as I can see from a short glimpse on GMs Income statement, the cost situation improved a little bit, while sales decreased. So the case is less clear. Furthermore, as GM's industry tends to be very competitive and cyclical in nature, a certain discount is warranted.

Nonetheless, there may be many more possible explanations, in GMs case many might be related to leverage and quality of earnings issues, as you will have to spend a lot of effort to check pension accounting, ESO's etc. Also, as many car manufacturers, GM has a consolidated financing services company (GM Financial), which makes things even more complex. 

So you need a lot of industry knowledge to judge whether GM is cheap or not, even with this low multiples. 

However, many value investors regard GM as cheap, so go ahead, any analysis on GM could be fruitful, though tedious. I would not advise to draw any conclusions without deep analysis."

This type of review likely wouldn't catch outright (well-executed) fraud, but it's enough to rectify any major errors. Additionally, if a Company has a big accounting correction after a 10-Q, but before the year-end 10-K is issued then that may indicate a control weakness which would be reported under SOX, so that may mitigate any shenanigans there.

But it is primarily a Chinese company though likely it will be more and more global over time.  Maybe it is backed out of the USA stock market cap (there are many other such companies - that are much smaller).

My guess is ADRs are automatically not included (for example Toyota ADRs trade in the USA but they ""real stock"" is in Japan).

There is another issue that isn't so much an issue in the USA but is for other countries.  As countries develop the percentage of private companies (not included in stock market cap) decreases compared to public companies.  So it isn't such a great measure for the USA anymore (Europe is even worse as the companies are way more international than even the USA) and developing markets have this systemic issue.

2015-05-15 00:20:39,[deleted]
2015-05-14 23:43:43,"That's okay, I'll try to break it down for you.

Stocks generate money in two ways: through an increased stock price and through dividends. Your risk (as a value investor) has nothing to do with volatility (beta), but whether the intrinsic value of an asset will be realized or not, and whether you have a sufficient delta between the current market price and the intrinsic value to achieve a sizable return.

With that said, if we're looking at equity bonds, we're looking at companies whose price movements and dividend yields mimic bonds. Bonds also have low volatility in price movements, and provide a ""dividend yield"" in the form of the interest rate on the bond, which varies depending on the grade. So given two instruments, a bond and a stock, each with equivalent yield, everything else put aside, you would choose the bond because it would produce the same generation of funds, but with less volatility and less risk (because bonds mature and get paid out, especially AAA bonds; equities are subject to market variance, such as earnings reports, and actual fundamentals on sales, revenue, profits, etc.). So if Hershey were to never change stock price ever again, as long as the dividend yield exceeded that of the treasury bond, it would be an attractive bond-like investment. In reality, the yield is lower than bonds, so it is not. So solely on the basis of dividend, bonds win.

Now we factor in the stock price. This simply boils down to which stocks produce the best returns. So you can try and analyze and convince yourself that you know something someone else doesn't know about a large cap stock like Hershey, that everyone and their mother has an analyst to value the stock, or you can own the whole S&amp;P 500. And in the latter, you would have outperformed Hershey by a significant margin. Now factor in dividend yield - HSY is 2.23% and SPY is 1.75%...so as long as SPY outperforms HSY by less than 50 basis points, it's a winner on all accounts. And it has been.

So therefore, when I look at a stock like HSY and I compare it to treasury bonds and the S&amp;P, I see lose-lose. I see an expensive stock that has underperformed the S&amp;P, and receives a lower dividend yield than a treasury bond. yeah no, I don't give a crap how great future earnings are; if it doesn't translate into a realization of substantially greater value, I see no reason to execute a long position on HSY."
2015-05-14 23:22:48,There are legitimate reasons to be concerned but I think this measure is outdated.  The largest companies by market cap in the USA have huge portions of their revenue and income from overseas (many are over 50%).  When that is true why should their market caps be a constant portion of USA GDP?
2015-05-14 23:09:25,"With all due respect, your comments are confusing to me. The fact that HSY's dividend yield and payout ratio is not higher speaks to management's confidence in their ability to grow future earnings through reinvestment. That they have an ROIC of 25% over the past 5 years should tell you that those reinvested funds are being put to good use. I think most people in this subreddit would take a lower dividend today in exchange for greater earnings power - and consequently higher share price - tomorrow.

Below is a chart of HSY, SPY, and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond. Here are their returns over the past 10 years:

HSY: 54.8%
SPY: 78.0%
TLT: 23.3

What matters at the end of the day is the sum or aggregate of fcf since the discounted value of that is theoretically the value of the firm to the equity holder. Adjusting for FCF is generally not too difficult; take operating cash flow from the cash flow statement and adjust for capex and acquisitions, which you will find under cash flow from investing activities. Most of the time cash flow shouldn't differ TOO much from net income; if it does, that's a huge red flag."

The Blackstone Group, for example, just finished raising a $4.5 billion energy fund in February and is reportedly raising another $1 billion to buy bonds and distressed loans of oil and gas companies. Blackstone’s credit division recently committed $500 million to fund drilling programs for Linn Energy and got an 85% working interest in some of Linn Energy’s oil and gas wells in return. The Carlyle Group has about $9 billion marked for energy deals, and its co-chief, billionaire David Rubenstein, recently said, “There is no other sector in the world that we are as bullish on as we are on energy.”

That said, an ""equity bond"" to me sounds like a dividend stock, and the dividend yield on this lower than a 10 year treasury. So if you're looking for safety and stability, why on earth would you take on additional risk for lower yield in a very expensive stock?

2015-05-12 20:32:44,"It depends. I agree it is along the same lines as an equity bond, but as the user above commented, look at the price Youre paying it can be painful. If you must own something, I would feel better owning HSY over bonds (scary) and over owning stocks with cyclical tendencies, (Boeing/cars idk), so it is a safe equity option of last resort. If you can sit on cash maybe that is a better option.

On another note it also depends on how long. Look at the historical price HSY has traded at, and assuming a stock price a contraction in X years, and the current price/ growth, estimate the future possible loss given the price. 

Example given share price 100, 25x earnings($4 E), 5% growth, and a historical 20x, given when you think the market may go down you can give yourself an envelope math loss expectancy. In this case if you wait 5 years... This example will own 5.10 in earnings assuming 5% CAGR of growth, and with a contraction to 20x historical multiple, you'll still make your investment at the current price. If you think with this mental model, just think of how long it will take for the company to grow to par assuming an exit multiple (conservative/worst case), and that's when you can expect to make back your principle given a stable earnings number... If you're comfortable with the time frame, im sure it'll be a great equity bond investment. "

2015-05-11 08:36:51,"Since the purpose of the CFS is to act as a check on the income statement, just look for anything which might indicate manipulation via timing of cash flows. e.g. unusual investments, refinancing patterns, funding dividends from loans, etc. It's also useful to pick out any abnormally large adjustments. Stuff which skip the income statement and go straight to the balance sheet are also red flags, like unsustainable principal repayments."
2015-05-11 07:09:11,Precisely. 
2015-05-11 07:08:49,"Thanks for the explanation. That's why I believe this is the best subreddit. However, could you please explain what one ought to look for in a cash flow?"
2015-05-11 06:17:25,"I'm going to explain this from the perspective of the income statement, but it should help you understand the cash flow statement as well. 

When a company earns cash, it goes into its wallet. Now if this were a 'project' instead of a 'company', the cash earned would immediately exit the sphere of the 'project' and go straight to the 'owners'. Thus the cash earned attributed to the project is obvious. 

However, a company might choose to retain the cash and reinvest it into a second project instead of giving it back. Now this is a large investment which drains your cash. When investors look at this, it has the wrong effect of attributing your empty cash balance to dismal performance of the first project - when in fact it did very well.  So to record actual performance, you match the expense against the revenues of the appropriate timeframe, i.e. future revenues and not past revenues. This is the concept of the income statement. 

However, companies are not static entities; they're constantly in a state of flux. The moment more cash comes in, they reinvest it. Thus it becomes exceedingly important to maintain a record of past performance (i.e. past cash flows earned attributed to past operations), so that past performance is correctly attributed to past operations. This is the net profit amount, and is accumulated in the retained earnings figure. 

This also has the great advantage of allowing more complex cash movements like loans, receivables etc. Basically, divorcing the actual cash flows from performance allowed companies to delay or speed up their expenses, which facilitated the liquidity of money itself. We would later recognize this as ""float"". 

That's why in the beginning, the SEC only required income statements and not cash flow statements; because given enough time, the cash flow statement eventually catches up to the income statement. The cash flow statement was therefore effectively redundant for making long term decisions. 

The problem arose when companies started to take advantage of this divorce from cash flows to manipulate earnings. For instance, constantly refinancing at higher and higher rates until the Ponzi scheme collapsed. Basically, the authorities realized that only allowing investors to observe the tip of the pyramid - and not the base on which it rests - allowed management to hide stuff for a long time before reality caught up. This was why the SEC reintroduced the cash flow statement - to provide a check and balance against the income statement which was built on top of it. 

Remember, the income statement merely matches cash flows across time; so in perpetuity both eventually converge. Thus, even though the cash flow statement was redundant for long term purposes, it made apparent the steps which were taken to arrive at the income statement. So that when the time comes to realize the retained earnings amount, the cash will be there.

2015-05-10 17:46:12,"Because a company can report incredible earnings, but if they aren't actually receiving the cash, they'll go bankrupt (or force the company to take on more short term debt changing the capital structure). Especially in cases where the earnings look great, but the company isn't receiving cash, the management may be committing improper revenue recognition (fraud). It's for that reason that some analysts like to use p/cf as its much harder to manipulate CF then earnings. "

Of the top of my head some good books are Quality of Earnings, Creative Cash Flow Reporting (I have it but haven't read it yet), Financial Shenanigans and Footnoted. 

There are others that I haven't read yet though. 

Basically when earnings don't show up as cash flow, you need to figure out why. Some businesses have perfectly good reasons for it but you have to figure out what they are. 
Amazon is usually debated for this. Bezos plows most earnings back into growing the business, some love that and others hate it. "

2015-05-10 00:47:01,"You can develop your advantage for a company primarily through an informational, analytical, or emotional edge. 

An informational edge is going to probably be the hardest type of edge because this implies you know something about a company, usually material, that the market has not priced in. Something like this would be knowing that a company's Q4 earnings will be higher than estimates/guidance before they're actually released. For all intents and purposes, that is considered trading on insider info and should be avoided. Because so many companies have large analyst coverage its unlikely you'll really ever find a true informational edge for the largest companies. 

An analytical edge is probably my favorite type of edge, because you're not looking for information the market doesn't know you're just trying to dig deeper and come to a different conclusion about the overall business, their financials, or the industry they operate in than what the Street has concluded. So basically, you're just trying to disprove the popular opinion about a company. Sometimes this isn't possible and you shouldn't try to be different just for the sake of being different, but a good example of this type of edge would be with Amazon. They are a revenue/cash flow story, but if you look closely at Amazon's cash flow statement the omit capital leases from their FCF calculation. Simply adding back those expenses to the equation shows that Amazon hasn't been cash flow positive in years. Another reason why an analytical edge is my favorite is because it can be most easily exploited among small/mid cap companies just because a lot of those businesses don't have large analyst coverage, and those that do are typically not the most important company on an analyst's coverage universe so it is likely that something is getting overlooked. Management teams from smaller companies are also more likely to pick up the phone when an outside investor is calling and asking about the overall economics of their industry rather than trying to mine for hints about what next quarter's results are going to be. 

Third, you can develop an emotional edge. An emotional edge does not require you to do any in depth analysis or reinvent the wheel on popular companies, you simply need to not pay attention to the market's sometimes volatile reactions to short-term news that can create buying opportunities for certain businesses. For example, there are a metric shit ton of O&amp;G and related businesses that have really been brought down in stock price because of the decline in oil prices. When you start to dig in to a lot of these companies you'll find that their businesses are in tact and the earnings power is still there, and they might not even be that exposed to the price of oil as the short-term market mentality might have believed. This can create a buying opportunity for you, but you need to have the peace of mind as an investor to know that you might have to suffer a quarter or two of disappointing results before the actual value of the company is realized. Another example of something like this would be the crash Apple had back in 2012. If I remember correctly, the reason why the Street was so negative on Apple back then was because the company missed the analyst estimates for the amount of iPhones that would be sold for the quarter, and the stock tanked. Its like, who actually gives a shit about analyst estimates? It was clear that the broader, ecosystem driven earnings potential of Apple was very much still intact and investors would have done well to load up on the stock when everyone else was selling. I know I did. 

So there are multiple ways you can develop your edge on any investment. It involves a lot of hard work and analysis on your part, and I think it'd be useful to start thinking of yourself as a business analyst rather than a stock analyst. Great investments are made by having a phenomenal understanding of a company's business economics and where it places within its value-chain, not having a fancier spreadsheet than everyone else. In fact, if you're not sure whether or not a company is great before you even open your spreadsheet I'd say you are not doing enough homework. "

2015-05-10 00:16:00,"I agree with /u/sava_texas. What is it that you know about these small caps that no one else knows? If it's nothing you're better off just parking cash in an index fund and enjoying the capital appreciation that the market provides. If you feel like there is something that is going to materially change to future returns for a specific business, that is your edge. That can only be achieved through your approach, which should be unique to the approach that every other investor is taking. Anybody can build a DCF - its the analysis and understanding of what the financial statements mean that will define your ""edge"" and your ability to generate excess returns in the mark.

TL;DR - Figure out what no one else knows and be a pig when it comes to exploiting your outlook.

With regards to your comment, I know that the guy who wrote ""The greatest trade ever"" said that it wasn't so much about people doubting the validity of this trade, but that the nature of the trade requires a negative carry which many fund managers weren't willing to take on. What I mean is that, assuming you have pay upfront for the CDS, then you're immediately down X bp for the year (on this position). In this case the linked paper states that the cost is 250 bp.  
Related to the above is that a small loss of 250 bp will probably make more people leave your fund than returning 100%+ will attract people. So even if the trade seemed good, many hedgefund managers were apparantly hesitant because of the above.  
Some guys went ahead with it anyway (Paulson, Kyle bass, Micheal Burry, Greg from DB), and I think some of them set up separate funds with the only objective of doing this trade (maybe so as to not lose investment in their main funds).  
Take the above with a grain of salt, but at least this is how I understood the reasoning as to why more people didn't make this trade.

I remember a post on here about a micro-cap Indian diamond wholesaler that was very interesting, even though I haven't thought about that space at all outside of the context of the post. 

As far as your question about a newsletter format- if you send a periodic email it's going to go right in with all the other periodic emails that I sometimes get to later.

2017-08-21 14:37:10,"I think that would be good basic insight, but the key is telling the reader something they don't already know. Anybody can find stats like that on Bloomberg. Your job is to either use the data in a way that makes logical implications not already reflected in the price, or to come up with new ideas that provide insights others haven't thought of. When it comes to Snap, everybody and their mother knows about its declining DAU growth, garbage financials etc. Maybe there's something else not discussed as much? As an example mention your thoughts on Evan Spiegel's capability as a CEO. Perhaps you read an obscure article from 2012 trashing on his abilities and think it has some merit today. Something *interesting* and *reasonable*.

2017-08-20 13:04:33,"Well, this goes a bit further than my expertise, but I did look into the SICAV briefly a year or two back on a structuring deal. Someone correct me if I'm misremembering.

The US/Lux treaty contains a provision for s specific Lux corporate entity (that is rarely in use anymore) that is not subject to taxation in Luxembourg. The treaty states the preferential tax rates do not apply to this entity type. Through analogy, it is generally thought that the Lux SICAV would also not receive the treaty rate. 

The ICAV structure is not a corporate entity but a regulated asset management collective vehicle and this different enough to be outside of the inclusion of those treaty provisions by analogy.

Reason I looked into it is the ICAV has some provisions that were no good for me. For example, you can't lend to natural persons or financial institutions. Two of the things my fund was considering at launch was MBS origination and PE fund lending, both of which the ICAV could not hold. The SICAV could do those things, but the treaty rate, we couldn't get to ""more likely than not"". And thus we ended up with yet another Lux SARL.

2017-08-20 12:32:30,Excellent reply thank you. Is an ICAV different from a SICAV that is a plc or can the latter also check the box to be treated as a partnership?  I'm wondering why the use of an ICAV rather than what I think is the more common SICAV plc structure which if I understand correctly is the more common European hedge fund /pe structure.  I'm guessing that it's not the ubti issue since a SICAV plc is a corporate structure.

The company you are studying has different rules depending on a number of factors, mainly driven by ownership shares. I'm not going to look them up for you, but in general, if the company you are looking at owns part (but not all) of another company, then the rules are something like this:

*50%+ then they report the full revenue and costs from the entity, back out the minority interest as you're asking about now*

*0-49.9% then they report income from minority interests after they report their operating profit, but before their pre-tax profit

I welcome anyone to provide more detail (or correct me) but this is how the reporting generally works. It's been awhile since I sat in an accounting class and the end result is the same. If it's material, I read the footnotes, and if not, I include in my analysis but otherwise generally ignore it."

For example, company a owns 60% of the company B. Company A is at a loss whereas Company B makes a profit. Now under standard accounting terms, the 40% off Company B that company a does not already own needs to be declared as noncontrolling interest. In this case that would be a positive number because company be made a profit. If company a made a loss that is bigger than the gain provided by their ownership in the company B then the net number would be negative. This would look like the parent is getting the losses while Company B is getting the games but it is just because of the optics of it. The reality is Company A is  just a loss making company and Company B just happened to be a fantastic investment by company A. "

2017-08-18 19:29:49,"Good article.

&gt;Our investment mantra lies in pursuing value not by searching for great companies, even ones that might be reasonably priced, but rather in sourcing “Out of favor, overlooked and misunderstood” securities.

An example of this I have found recently lies in the auto sector.  There is speculation surrounding peak auto sales and that auto is looking gloomy for the next few years (whether that is true or not I don't know, but it is currently priced for the worst).  As such, I believe ETF selloffs are responsible for depressing certain stock prices to an irrational level - particularly some of the auto parts suppliers.  I wouldn't likely invest in auto makers themselves due to not liking the fundamentals of the business, but the parts suppliers are higher margin and often diversified in other industries (one of my parts stocks has only 40% of revenue from auto exposure, yet declined comparable to other auto stocks).  If 2008 level auto sales hit, it doesn't matter which auto makers survive or which ones don't - they will still need parts when auto sales pick up again.  If you pick fundamentally strong businesses with management who understand the cyclical nature of their business, you'll do okay."

2017-08-18 15:44:34,"Color me skeptical.

5G is going to be a massive investment. Imagine having to set up a WiFi device on every single block of NYC. That's the level of investment we are talking about. It will be very expensive and take a long time. Unless technology makes some leaps, it's not going to be feasible for much of the world (less dense/rural areas specifically, so everywhere that's not a major metro city). 

Additionally, (correct me if I'm wrong) I understand the spectrum allocated to 5G is pretty crappy. It's in the 25-100ghz range vs the 3-10ghz range for 3G/4G. Higher frequency waves travel much shorter distance (hence why you need a wifi on every block) and are much more susceptible to distortion (tree rustling in the wind or concrete jungles/cars will interfere). 28ghz frequencies can be stopped by rain drops and &gt;70ghz they can be stopped by oxygen molecules. We need to figure out a way to save some of the lower frequency for 5G if it is supposed to work properly. Early 5G roll outs are likely going to suck until they get this under control."

2018-07-03 07:00:19,"I am reasonably familiar with this type of investing, but not with “Secured Real Estate Income Strategies LLC"" (SREIS).  I am a ""private lender"" or Hard money lender, and I often do similar deals privately.  The concept described in the ""cartoon"" videos is accurate.  The risk with this type of investing (not considering SREIS) is valuing the property and lending &lt; 70&amp;#37; of value.   But value can be vague.  What is value? Typically value is what a reasonable borrower will pay to buy the property. Some borrowers want to use ""after repaired value"" (ARV). If ARV is used, the the lender must hold some of the money in escrow.  Moreover, SREIS does the valuing.  As an investor, I want the borrower (i.e., builder, developer, &amp;/or SREIS, etc.) to have a dog in the fight; I'd want them to have money at risk.  It is difficult for an investor in SREIS to determine if the borrower (the builder/developer) is at risk when SREIS does the decision making.  In other words, how would an investor in SREIS know SREIS is making prudent &amp; well secured loans to borrowers? You must have faith &amp; trust in SREIS.  When a company (like SREIS) uses other people's money there is the possibility they could be less cautious than if you were lending your own money.

In the stock market, REITs are stocks that do what SREIS does. But there is a problem with REITs: their value fluctuates AND management often issues more shares which dilutes your equity and causes share price to fall. For this reason I think REITs are a scam.  A project in which SREIS invests would not loose value (in theory); SREIS claims value goes up because the borrowers add value by rehabbing the properties; this is true, IMO."
2018-07-03 06:32:27,"I talked to my sister and her husband who have toddlers etc. They said they 100% would so its probably more of a ""family"" thing. Do your friends who you asked that said no have families? Not only that, but are they disney type of people? I wouldnt expect that this streaming service would be appealing non-disney types i.e. think churchgoers, do gooders, people who dont litter etc etc. 

As for ESPN, r.i.p. lots of sports millenials basically dont use it anymore as their sports news source since there are so many options online. So not even cordcutting, its just an organic death from consumer taste. 

Something to note: WWE hss their $10/month subscription and those sports people are fanatics. It works for them. Can ESPN mimic that sense? Doubt it. But iirc, the streaming service is going to give the whole shabang. Movies, content, sports, probably discounts to disneyland too. Why not. "

2018-07-02 17:58:41,"Hello, thank you for your comments and feedback.

With respect to your comment on “most insightful” or “hubris” or “rock solid”, we tried to address the point with the following statement in the post:

“Our approach in making a value allocation within our portfolio is to add a basket of stocks that may collectively prove to have had value but the failure of one or two of the businesses do not permanently impair the portfolio. In this regard, we identify three retail stocks to add to our portfolio and will look to add more value candidates from other sectors to our portfolio over time.”

The point being that we are not confident of making a major allocation to any one stock and accept that we may get several picks wrong. So instead we prefer to take a basket approach and allocate to several stocks where they may potentially be value.

Generally, our approach is rarely involves a high conviction cal to invest in one stock. We tend to look for several stocks that would fit one theme and then allocate to all or some of them.

With respect to building detailed models and projections, these are readily available from most sell side analysts. And academic evidence suggests that most sell side analysts’ projections for a forward twelve month period tend to be fairly “accurate”. Therefore while we do build high level financial models, we do not consider our approach to add much, if any, value over above what is provided by the sell side. Instead we feel our value add is in taking a step back taking a look at the big picture and using the insight from that to find stocks / areas of the market to invest in.

On supporting data for the statements we have provided, there is plenty and we would be happy to share with anyone that would like the data or more detailed information. 

Our aim in the post is to share our broad level thinking and the rationale behind increasing allocation to the “value” factor. This approach we have found works for us and we like to think is easy to consume. But we also understand that it does not work many especially who would want much more detailed analysis. "

However, your post worries me. Especially because you offer *premium* research! Let's run through just three of a handful of scary points:

1. For a post on being value-oriented, where's the valuation on *any* stock? Where is the data on foot-traffic, sales per sq. ft, or just supporting data for statements like, ""**the wave of home buying is only getting started**""?   

2. OK, maybe it's a qualitative analysis. Let's reference what you said about $BKS on this: ""**new format will be focused on books, and include a café as well as a curated assortment of non-book products...**""—bookstore with a coffee shop and supplemental products now focusing on books with a coffee shop and supplemental products?— "".**..Under performing categories like music and DVDs will be dropped.**""—cost cutting other ""non-book products"" with no financial models on possible outcome attached, uh-oh.   

3. This was funny: ""**The sheer number of incumbent business models being disrupted means that** ***for anyone, except the most insightful, it is only hubris that would allow one to have rock solid confidence*** **in the durability of any incumbent business model**,"" (emphasis mine). Your logic here either says (1) you're of the ""most insightful"" because you believe in the three stocks you mentioned, (2) you have ""hubris"" for believing in these companies without a lot of insight, or (3) you lack insight or ""rock solid confidence,"" in which case, what's the point of this? 

Sorry for taking a dig at your post, but I just had to raise some points considering you want to (1) promote your site, and (2) have a service you want to get paid for on there. "

2018-07-02 14:57:54,"EBIT/EV? Haha, maybe so.

I think it's a decent (not perfect, ofc) metric since it makes the company comparable to that of the risk-free rate. For example, if you invest 1K into a 3% bond, that would pay you $30 pre-tax annually. If you wholly purchased Disney at an enterprise value of $180B and it earns $14.5B, that would give you a pre-tax yield of 8%. 

The larger the spread, the wider the margin of safety and vice versa."

2018-07-02 07:57:08,"Generally in regards to IO investment loans within real estate, the notion is that the saved 'principal' portion of the loan can be put to work better elsewhere. The interest portion of the repayments are tax deductible, the principal payments are not. In an ideal scenario property prices would rise over time leaving your debt position on the given property negligible. As with any series bull run, people tend to over-extend and disregard any margin of safety and/or cash/income buffer to fund scenarios such as what we are faced with in Australia. It seems, unfortunately it will likely be new home owners that have stretched the furthest in order to get in to such a hot market. Many property investors i speak with have a fairly solid cash flow position and many have bought in the less heated, better yielding markets up north."

Analysts say the overall damage to China won't exceed 50 basis points of GDP, therefore I can't see how this will cause the entire economy to stagnate.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, China is projected to increase disposable income 6.7% - 7% per year, especially in the more rural areas. Whilst China has lost (if I recall correctly) 15 million manufacturing jobs, they've created 70 million service jobs.

I have considered that there are many speculators piling into this stock, and they've followed a pattern of pump to \~70 RSI, then dump to \~45 RSI. Having said this, if we carefully assess the volumes and the trend, this volatility is only an issue if your time horizon is &lt;1.5 - 2 years.

So let me get this straight.

You asked the CEO, where's the cash flow? When you could have just gone to the cash flow statement and seen yourself that it was going into inventory. Shouldn't you be doing that every single time?

Seeing that a company uses LIFO vs FIFO isn't good research, that's called ACTUALLY READING THE ANNUAL REPORT.

Finally, could it be that buying Cobalt in the open market is a rational thing to do when Cobalt prices are low? That's not fraud, that's gaming gaap accounting.

If the accounting methodology used for inventories  ( FIFO or LIFO )  are well known and stated in the filings , is this an actual instance of fraud, in a criminal sense?

I did take a quick look at the 2002 10-K. Strictly on a cash flow from operations - capex basis free cash flow was positive in 2000 and negative in 2001 as you say in the story. I’m not sure if I personally would have found the inventory accounting because working capital in total was a very large use of cash during that year, not just inventory. Anyway, thanks!"

2019-07-18 02:05:36,"These are all good questions. In terms of DuPont, I'm not familiar with this model nor do I use ROE as part of my calculations - what drives the SP up or down is expectations, and the beating or missing of expectations. Based on my analysis of their earnings transcripts, I don't believe QD are highly leveraged - they're currently leveraged around 2.1x Equity, which seems very reasonable for micro-lending, especially considering their low delinquency rates. They are currently paying an effective tax rate of 10%, and I suspect this will continue for \~2 more years - the Chinese government give strong subsidies and rebates to ""internet companies"" within their first few years of operation, though the classification of which is highly anecdotal.

&amp;#x200B;

Excess demand is good, in the right situation. Given that QD purposefully err on the very conservative side of lending, and maintain their approval rates lower than all their peers, I don't see this as an issue. They only serve \~5.5 million of their 29.1 approved, and 73.3 total borrowers, and whilst they say that they refer indiscriminately, I don't believe this is the case. Having this much data on this many transactions, I believe they keep the super premium low default risk borrowers close to their chest and refer the rest out...

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, remember that they are effectively a facilitator of lending. During the last 3 quarters, their off-balance sheet transactions drove most of their earnings growth, therefore I see most of their cash coming from operations; their funding partners deal directly with customers and pay QD a cut.

What do you think's gonna happen tomorrow?

BECKY QUICK: A lot of people coming to the United States.

WARREN EDWARD BUFFETT: A lot of people are going to come to the United States. Very few people are going to leave. North Korea might have a small decrease in population. I mean, the point is, I mean, this is an incredible country. And it's true that right now we're raising $3.3 trillion and spending probably $4.3. We're about to have a debt – a deficit of about $1 trillion in a very good year in the cycle. I mean, year of prosperity, and that's 5% of GDP, and that's probably more than – you could actually take a 2% to 3% deficit and not have the ratio of debt to GDP growth. Five in prosper shares, we're out of whack on that. So we, you know, you can cut spending, you can raise taxes.

2019-10-20 22:35:09,"Book value- when you are asking how to calculate book value, what you are really asking is how much did 3M record all of their asset values.  There are three times when that number is useful, when you are going to buy and liquidate the company for the machinery and land, if you are going to start the exact same business with all of the exact same purchase price of the assets or if there's something on the books that is really valuable.

Test 1 - Is anyone going to liquidate 3m?  No - test fails

Test 2 - Is anyone going to start the exact same business as 3M?  No - too many parts and they purchased lots of junk over the last 100 years.  Who really knows whats in there now. 

Test 3 - Something valuable on the books?  Not worth looking currently.  An example of this would be a partial interest in a railroad that pays dividends to 3M.  But even then, I doubt that knowing that information is going to help you with a purchase decision.  Softbanks' ownership of Alibaba is an example of this type of asset.

Also, have fun with the concept that the earnings yield is the reverse of the price to earnings ratio.  3m trades at a PE of about 18, so 1/18 = an implied earnings yield of about 5.5%.  Lay money out today and you are looking at getting your cash back in roughly 20 years.  That's if nothing goes wrong.  That's if there's no capital crisis in the next 20 years.  That's if 3m remains competitive.

For lots and lots of fun, try and figure out what each line of 3M makes, the competitive forces in each line and project your best guess at earnings for the next 10 years.

My real advice to you, if you are learning, is to look at a real simple company that' small - I give you Tandy Leather (TLF).  Calculate the book value there.  The have a $19,000,000 building, $22,000,000 in cash, $30,000,000 in inventory and a market value of $40,000,000

Problem there is...they didn't file their last quarter because of accounting problems with their inventory, so they are going to have to restate an awful lot of earnings.

Like most F500 companies, 3M's book-value is slightly distorted from all of their share buybacks when the company was trading with a price/book greater than 1.

2019-10-20 21:00:55,Look up “discounted cash flow” analysis
2019-10-20 20:53:40,"What you calculated is book value per share. 3M's share price is the market's attempt at valuing the business. In reality the intrinsic value could be anything below, above or equal to the market price.

Typically stocks with a high price to book ratio also have a high return on equity. Book value is generally not a good measure of intrinsic value.

For example

Company A has a $100 book value and earns $10 a year while Company B has a $100 book value and earns $50 a year. Clearly Company B is more valuable than Company A yet they have the same book value."

2019-10-20 19:35:27,"Book value (total equity) is an accounting figure. The market price is determined by supply and demand, and often with only a loose connection to fundamentals (e.g. accounting). There is no reason the two numbers you mentioned (book value per share, and share price) should be equal."
2019-10-20 19:30:53,"Book value isn’t always a determinant of share price.  According to google 3M is trading at 9.3x book value. So, if you take your calculation of 17.08 book value per share and multiply it by 9.3, you get roughly the share price it’s trading at."

Not bashing you.  Just giving some perspective on how they may be interpreting it."
2019-10-20 14:19:56,"Fair point and question.

The key thing is that there is a cost to holding cash on hand at the bank. It's not as simple as just recording it electronically. You have to physically transport and keep the money somewhere, either with you at your bank or at the central bank. You physically have to transport the cash (security/transportation expense) and secure it in a vault (additional operating expenses). Yes, you may think these are small expenses, but if you have millions or billions of cash on hand, these additional costs add up and the logistics of shifting around money every so often to meet different liquidity needs can become unreasonable. Contrast this to having EUR 100m in cash deposited at the central bank with a -0.5% interest rate. The daily cost of keeping your money with the central bank is only about EUR 1,400 per day, a relatively small and possibly worthwhile expense.

I don't know exactly how much it would cost a bank to keep the cash themselves but it's not unreasonable to see why they don't despite negative rates. There's likely a lower bound of negative rates below which banks would be worse off keeping the cash at central banks. I guess we're just not there (yet)."
2019-10-20 14:01:21,"Thank you for the feedback! It’s true that a bearish scenario should be included, however I felt like I would just be guessing the rate of growth, instead of basing it upon reasonable assumptions.

And thanks for pointing out the possible flaw in cost of equity; I didn’t consider that.

Finally, I admit I may have gotten carried away a little with the adjectives. Next time, I will use more neutral vocabulary"
2019-10-20 13:53:15,"You used a discount rate of 7% (CAPM) because using 4% (WACC) provides an unrealistic valuation.  What about your conservative cost of equity estimate of 8%?  I'm just getting a hint of model over fitting, or maybe you just need to give a little more explanation of how you made that decision.  After you realize your model is spitting out an unrealistic number you should think about  reevaluating all of your assumptions, especially growth assumptions.  I would think about adding a third scenario for earnings growth,a bearish one.  You don't have to assign a high probability to that scenario occurring, but you should acknowledge it exists.  Finally, try to refrain from using adjectives like ""fantastic"", but thats just my personal preference.  You are supposed to be independent and objective and I feel words like fantastic, wonderful and horrible make people sound a little biased.      

Some questions I would ask myself: Is sales growth/ economic environment in the next 5 years going to be similar to the previous 5 years? What does it mean for earnings if it isn't?  Has management guided for the number of stores they plan to open?  If they open fewer stores than I anticipate, will sales growth be closer to SSS than 8-10%?

Instead of ""the management"", just say ""management"".

Greater sales of lower margin consumables is not a problem if turnover of such consumables is higher than the other goods sold. Focus on ROI (with which you do a good job).

Leverage should be measured using the market value of debt and equity. Thus, DG's leverage is not as high as your calculation. See [Matt Levine on his ""Netflix Theory""](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-05/expensive-stocks-make-for-good-bonds).

What is ""interest"" on operating leases?

Accounts payables growing faster than inventories and sales is a good thing (and not worrisome) because it shortens the cash conversion cycle (CCC). You should calculate the CCC for DG over time and plot it.

In the competitive analysis section, you mentioned the cost of opening a new store. Can you calculate and plot over time the approximate ROI of a new store? Similar to Section 6.3. Make appropriate assumptions as necessary. High and sustained new store ROI will be evidence of a competitive advantage.

Overall, good job. Keep working on this craft called equity research.

I glanced through the report out of curiosity.  Unaware of the motivation. If it is a thesis that is one thing. I assume it is a business proposal to purchase stocks on DG. Indeed DG has been doing quite well.  If you go to US Southern States, AL, NC, SC etc you see more Ollie, DLTR stores than DG. 98% goods are low end goods with *Hecho de China*. We got a Trade War going. In 4.2 you declined to research on impact of the largest and almost sole supplier country. What I will do is analyze a couple scenarios using 15% tariff analyze impact on profit margin. All 15% pass on to customer. absorb all 15%, and split the difference(most likely outcome). May be the breakeven point what point the business will collapse (25, 35% tariff rate).

Ollie is a major player in this business. Some how you did not mention it. I personally think it is a better investment than all researched stocks in your analysis.

I am unsure on the recession remark it will thrive better because of lack of incomes. Most pawn shop stocks did opposite of what people speculated during the long Great Recession.  In fact investors lost their $. The reason is not well understood other people lost 30-40% of the investment. COST did not fare much better was also a surprise.

All in all, it is a very straight forward research report except the trade war paragraph which can certainly act as a strong argument that it can affect the bottom line more than what was presented. Well done.

2019-10-19 19:43:47,"If I understand correctly your example, I believe the problem with the DCF is that you're basically saying that ROE is equal to growth and since the terminal value of a DCF is an infinite sum it is as if you were dividing by zero (with the numerator being 10 and the denominator being discount rate of 10% minus growth of 10%).

In real life this would never be a problem because long-term discont rates are higher than growth and past a certain point the yearly income would become so discounted that its value would converge to zero (and there is also the fact that companies do not operate until eternity). You're not doing anything wrong but the exercise you are trying to do with the DCF is too theoretical for it to work properly."

But it seems that nobody is going to value KO at 60x earnings (besides some bubble moments) because they can earn money for another 200 years. 

Most of a high multiple is really growth. 

Always found it more useful to think in terms of growth and ROIC. You need both.

2020-04-30 12:26:05,"Thank you for providing the well formatted write up! I think you missed a lot of key topics, and am not entirely sure I understand your thesis. The two questions I ask myself when looking at a company from a value perspective are: Is the company cheap? Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage (moat)?

* Is the company Cheap?

Due to COVID, historical comparisons have become tricky regarding public valuations. Should we use TTM cash flow figures and include a strong economic picture or NTM figures that have a significant degree of uncertainty baked in? On a TTM basis, they are currently trading at 26.89x EV/EBITDA. Relative to their average over the past 3 years of 23.7x, they seem a bit more pricey than normal. The last 4 quarters of performance for DPZ were pretty strong, which makes this valuation confusing. Did they really perform so well that they should be demanding a high multiple during a global recession relative to when the overall economy was stronger? A rich valuation would lead me to believe we're likely to see significant growth over the next 12-24 months, but the overall market situation doesn't appear to support that. 

* Does Dominoes have a sustainable comparative advantage?

Over the past two to three years, their competitive advantage had consisted of their delivery app being superior and making that investment prior to many other food chains. This required a major fixed cost investment that provided them with some safety from their restaurant peers. The large fixed cost investment they made raised the barriers to enter on the food delivery portion of their business, allowing for a moat to form.What has since formed is that 3rd party delivery apps will now provide this service to restaurants at a variable cost, allowing other restaurants to enter the delivery game with very little investment of their own. This will be the first major test of their moat to see if it truly exists. Often we don't know how strong a moat is until it is tested.

* 

Overall, your presentation was very nice but I felt like you didn't answer some of the major questions when it comes to whether or not to invest in this company. Your thesis seemed to escape me, as I am not sure why they are a better buy than another pizza franchiser. The most concerning thing to me is the lack of digging into the debt picture, while also sighting P/B as a ratio on a major restaurant chain. Franchise businesses have routinely been highly levered, with McDonalds being one of the best capitalized at 3.23x Net Debt to EBITDA (DPZ is 5.77x). The equity has been negative since at least 2017, and the value of buybacks have exceeded net income for several years now."
2020-04-30 12:14:48,"I like the clean &amp; organized structure of your write up, but I don't see much substance. You don't really touch on valuation outside of P/B, which isn't very useful for a company with negative equity. Domino's does have a great business model - they offer a consistent product at every location. You know what you're getting anytime you order, and like you said, quality and customer service have gone way up since the rebranding. But a good business model doesn't mean anything about price. It's a good business at $360/share and $500/share, so you need to expand on how and why it's mis-priced. 

&gt; Price to income and cash flow Domino’s Pizza are considered overpriced and expensive.   
&gt;  
&gt; Domino’s Pizza has almost the cheapest valuation out there, #72 out of 5,500 stocks. 

There might be an argument for Domino's being under-valued, but you're not making it here. You need to expand on fundamentals more than just quoting a stock app.

Personally, I'd want to see you dive into the debt picture more. Provide some liquidity ratios, and compare them to industry peers. What's the cost of debt? You mentioned they're good at allocating capital, so it must be cheap if they carry $4b in long term debt? I thought some of it might be leases but I see $220m in capital leases, so the long term debt concerns me. Also show us valuation metrics versus peers. EV/EBITDA, P/FCF, whatever you think is relevant.

Hope I'm not being overly-critical. I think you wrote a great primer on the company, and provided solid insight into their business model. Thanks for posting, it's good practice for us too."

2020-04-30 12:05:03,"That and the advent of apps like Uber eats means that people have a larger array of options when it comes to delivery. 2-3 years ago, if you wanted to be lazy and eat at home, Dominos was one of the only options. Now with uber eats, most restaurants also offer delivery. This could result in less demand for Domino's delivery overall. I know I personally have started opting for other food because uber eats gives you that flexibility. That combined with the fact that they rarely update their pizza selection means that people like me are getting bored of pizza and looking to other restaurants via uber eats. This could also tie in to the healthy food trend, with healthier food also now available for delivery. This is mostly qualitative things however and a more in depth analysis should be conducted with numbers from popular delivery apps such as uber eats.

Great analysis though."
2020-04-30 12:03:24,"If it helps OP, I was looking into Domino's 6 years back in India. I thought it was a definite gonner when Indian startups offered free food delivery for all the restaurants. Because at that time I was convinced that Domino's only moat is it's 30 mins delivery. But now 6 years after Domino's India is doing very well. Perhaps you can make some parallels with Indian stock on what happens when free food delivery apps flood the market.

I tried doing some search just now and I was struggling to find out as well, worth digging into more.

2020-04-30 11:10:29,"I think you may have glossed over their debt a little bit here. The $4 billion number seems high not just because of their annual cash flow but because they only have about $1.3 billion in assets which means they have negative equity to the tune of several $Billion. (I’m not sure where you got the P/B number since it should be negative?) Also, if you are going to buy I would look into when this debt comes due which I couldn’t find with a quick google search. With such a massive amount of debt there could be some refinancing risks to take into account with potentially higher interest rates"
2020-04-30 11:08:47,"Very good points.

Health trends I didn't touch on at all. I should do some research into where this has an impact versus their stores. I guess by being a franchise it limits their overall risk. They do still have over 500 stories of their own, I hope they are testing innovation and changing consumer tasters there. However, as you said I haven't done the research there.

Delivery apps is an interesting one. A few pizza chains also partner with other delivery services but (at least in the UK) domino's doesn't. I'm not sure if this is a franchise by franchise decision or a restriction set out in the contract."

2020-04-30 11:01:23,"Yes, I would keep an eye on the stock for sure, wait for it to see how it reacts to this whole Lockdown. If the stock price drops because lets say of lower revenues from stores closures etc, then I would jump into it because you know from your analysis that it has potential.   
 As we have this ""Virus"" which is bad news for all of us, this is a good opportunity to wait for it. I believe there is no room for going drastically up in these days as the   
lock-downs are in effect, so it can only drop. Right after the smoke clears it will gain an aggressive upwards trend which you will benefit because you bought low.

 Reduction in asset Prices increase yields. Rises in asset prices only increase returns if you already own the assets so if you are sitting on the side lines in saving you may percieve now is not the time to jump into the market because the yield you would recieve for the risk is too low."
2020-04-30 10:30:58,"There's great content already in here. Let me bring some attention to a feature that goes hand in hand with 0 or near 0 interest rates. 

0% nominal interest rates will typically mean negative real (inflation adjusted) rates. If I earn 0% interest and inflation is %1 then I lose 1% of buying power every year. I'm highly incentivized to spend that than save it. Also, I'm incentivized to increase my spending with cheap debt. This can create a bubble in certain debt classes, or in equities where savers look for a better return. Often the fundamentals of the assets become ignored when the choice is to definitely lose some value versus a possible return with higher risk.

Worse still, the economy can become reliant on cheap debt, and it makes raising rates to slow an overheated economy more dangerous. A lot of the economy today is built on short term lending called commercial paper. These are typically revolving loans that cover short term costs. If rates begin to climb, then those costs quickly climb because they have to be refinanced monthly much of the time. This leads to liquidity risks.

Also, 0% interest is a bit of a psychological thing. Mathmatically any rate could make sense depending on inflation and the returns from competing securities. But market psychology has made that point a big one. So the market thinks it's bad (it probably is most of the time) and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy as people buy and sell with fear.



Tldr. Borrowing is incentivized instead of saving. This distorts behaviors and leads to overborrowing. Bubbles grow. Bubbles pop."
2020-04-30 10:09:59,To expand on this if investors want to reach for higher yields (say 7-10%) in a low interest rate environment they have to either invest in riskier assets or take on leverage in order to do so.

2020-04-30 06:34:52,"&gt;I'm a little lost on OP's comment too, are they suggesting that people are saving more than spending? It seems like the opposite is true based on what I'm seeing.

Saving more than investing. The way I think of it is that money is sitting in bank accounts, but those banks aren't using all of it to invest in companies, much of it is just being left to sit there. Low interest rates means they aren't losing much by doing so, and the banks might consider the risk of lending to businesses in a recession as higher than the financial risk of losing 0.1% of the monetary value each year in interest."
2020-04-30 06:27:52,"&gt;The natural conclusion to all this is that savings need to be reduced. 

The way I think about it is that demand for investments needs to be raised. For the past 10 years a lot of idle cash has been sitting in bank accounts not doing anything, not least because inflation has been so low that the value of that cash hasn't been eroded by much.

&gt;To reduce savings requires massive drops in the value of every asset class (real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.), which will necessitate a deflationary cycle that has an unknowable bottom.

I'm not sure how you extrapolate this from a need to invest more. We need better investment opportunities, falls in asset prices would likely achieve the opposite. 

One thing that could possibly increase it is stimulating business demand, maybe through targeted government investment or government consumption."

2020-04-30 06:08:50,"&gt;I'm having a little trouble understanding this. So if I understand correctly, the gold standard means that the dollar has a backing in stored physical gold, and during the depression the price of the gold went up because of demand. Doesn't this mean that the value of a dollar bill also went up?

Here's my understanding, admittedly it's a bit rusty:

The dollar was pegged to gold, similar to currency pegs you see today. The BoE determined how much each dollar was worth, in terms of gold, and so adjusted the quantity of gold and dollars in circulation accordingly to maintain that peg.

In 1929 the demand for gold went up, as did its price *in terms of dollars*. The government had to maintain the peg though, and the way they achieved this was though selling their gold stocks in the open market (increase the supply, price should fall). The upshot though was that whilst more gold was being released into the market, the money it was being bought for was being removed from the market. Hence the overall money supply fell even further and compounded the country's issues."
2020-04-30 05:59:55,True. Hence why you'll rarely find a country with zero inflation implementing high interest rates.
2020-04-30 04:50:46,"Exactly, but with even more differences in terms of culture and institutions than in the US."

2020-04-30 04:40:48,"&gt; Say you want to buy a car, and because we have deflation prices next month are going to be considerably cheaper than they are now. How will you respond? You'll probably hold off buying that car.

But that is exactly same effect as having positive real interest rates. Assume there's zero inflation and a positive interest rate. If instead of buying the car now, you save that money until next month, you can buy the same car next month, you end up car + money left over, which is functionally equivalent to the car price going down with zero interest rate over that period."
2020-04-30 04:38:08,Because nobody will lend Money at 0 percent except the government. So the government becomes the only lender. And nobody will hold debt. To buy up all this debt means government must print the money which is highly inflationary which then leads to extremely high cost of debt.
2020-04-30 04:19:54,"The problem with finding ‘uncorrelated assets’ to limit price volatility is two-fold. One, it presumes that the shorter term price volatility equates to risk and, two, it presumes that historical relationships between different asset classes will hold in the future.

Risk is the chance that an investor will lose their money. To tackle this probabilistically an investor should first start by understanding the asset they wish to invest towards and their time horizon of their investment.

An investors capacity to handle risk is directly related to their time horizon. If an investor has a very low time-risk tolerance their investments should be in treasury bills. The longer an investor’s time horizon, the more investment alternatives are available.

So long as one has a 10 yr plus time horizon, a 100% allocation to equities makes the most sense.

One of the consequences of modern portfolio theory has been an obsessive pursuit of greater and greater diversification to the point where some investors attempt to have their financial assets spread over an exceptionally large base. Simply put, it is impossible to outperform the market when you are diversified to such an extent that you become the market.

**Own more companies that are cheaper and less of companies that are dear. Portfolio weightings should be based off each company’s share price relative to intrinsic value.  Strike a balance between minimizing risk and maintaining the benefits of a focused portfolio.**"
2020-04-30 03:40:06,"&gt;In 1929, we went into recession following a stock market crash and the economic orthodoxy at the time was to protect the value of money by tying it to gold (the Gold Standard). The effect was to reduce the money supply in the economy, which had a deflationary affect,

I'm having a little trouble understanding this. So if I understand correctly, the gold standard means that the dollar has a backing in stored physical gold, and during the depression the price of the gold went up because of demand. Doesn't this mean that the value of a *dollar bill* also went up?

Or in other words, the dollars out there (in circulation, or in banks, or tied up as bonds or assets or stored under the mattress) remained the same because the amount of gold backing the dollars at the fed remained the same, no?

Why do we then say that the money supply in the economy went down? Is it because the people who bought gold for dollars reduced the liquidity within the banks, and then in the debt markets?

For example the Fed will never go negative because they simply just don’t have the infrastructure in place to do negative rates. Instead they *effectively* implement negative rates through unconventional monetary policy. As another commenter also pointed out, people don’t just have trillions of $ in cash lying around. They are usually stored in the form of securities etc. all of which can be affected by conventional monetary policy if the right infrastructure was in place.

2020-04-29 22:19:33,"If you have any experience conceptually with pegged currencies this will probably make more sense, but generally:

1 Dollar was pegged to a physical amount of gold. Gold is a safe haven asset, so during the stock market crash, investors purchased gold, raising the price. Since the peg was still set though, and the value of the dollar didn't change, the government was effectively acting as a gold seller, which sold out a bunch of gold. This lowered the money supply and took money out of banks, [raising the value of a dollar](https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2012/04/19/AECrash29_t800.jpg?90232451fbcadccc64a17de7521d859a8f88077d), which helped accelerate the 1929 bank run. Added to this, high tariffs discouraged trade and austerity policies meant the government was reluctant to spend more. Since spending is someone else's income, you get a run away cycle where everyone tries to cut spending more than their neighbor, leading to a race to lowering consumer spending. Government policy at the time effectively encouraged this by not picking up the spending slack with increased spending as seen in the New Deal.

Effectively, panic accelerated the Great Depression. The (partial)  solution was to make gold float against the US dollar, so in the event of another downturn investors who wanted to buy gold had to do so with the depreciated currency, making it a less attractive option and making them less likely to contribute to bank runs than during 1929. This effectively removed the Fed's policy of acting as a dollar buyer of last resort, encouraging inflation as the dollar's decreasing relative value encouraged investors to either spend or invest their money rather than purchasing gold with it.

Now, the argument is over whether an appreciating dollar is actually a bad thing, because it rewards savers who kept their cash ""under the mattress"" instead of having invested it, versus losing a safe haven and instead forcing investors to keep their money circulating. A circulating dollar is a useful dollar versus just hoarding wealth in my opinion, but I digress.

TL;DR Fed backstopping the dollar with gold created a floor on how low the value of a dollar would go, encouraging deflation which often runs away into recessions/depressions."
2020-04-29 22:08:40,It’s hilarious to me that people think economics can be siloed from politics and society. Just an observation.
2020-04-29 21:57:12,"&gt; In 1929, we went into recession following a stock market crash and the economic orthodoxy at the time was to protect the value of money by tying it to gold (the Gold Standard).

2020-04-29 21:25:24,"Negative REAL interest rates can exist so long as the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of interest. They are actually quite common and a useful tool to spur investment. Some economists proposed raising the Fed's inflation target to 4% during the last recession to reduce the real interest rate, given that the nominal interest rate was effectively at 0% and couldn't be dropped further.

The alternative which I think you're getting at is negative nominal interest rates. This is still a fairly controversial economic policy which few major governments have ever implemented. The problem here is that it completely distorts the usual function of lending - now ""lenders"" will have to pay to lend, rather than receive interest. But why in that instance would you bother lending that money? Lending is risky, and you need a reward to do so, hence why you get paid interest. If you have to pay to lend why not just keep the money under a mattress or in a safe? The rules of the economy cease to function at negative nominal rates."
2020-04-29 21:24:40,"No hurdle rate for investment--the lack of consequence/burden makes people allocate capital carelessly, which is wealth destructive for individuals/societies.

It's bad for banks/pensions/insurance/financial companies that are limited in their ability to invest in equities (e.g. - Insurance rates go up as interest rates go down: Low interest rates makes insurance float less valuable so they need to raise their rates to create underwriting profits to make up for the decrease in income from their fixed-income investments).

It sets a precedence of helping irresponsible borrowers and hurting responsible savers, which, given a priori reasoning, is harmful."

2020-04-29 21:12:03,Deflation is not inherently bad at all. There is a phenomenal book called “The Price of Tomorrow” by Jeff Booth that I can’t recommend enough on the subject.
2020-04-29 21:02:42,"This is stuff you can find in any economics textbook. They really require a full answer which is too much to explain in a single comment on Reddit. That said, I'll give you my condensed understanding.

&gt;Can I ask you why deflation is bad?

Say you want to buy a car, and because we have deflation prices next month are going to be considerably cheaper than they are now. How will you respond? You'll probably hold off buying that car.

Extrapolate that to the whole economy, and you can see how it can quickly slow production in... pretty much everything of big ticket value. Nobody buying anything leads to companies not selling products. Companies are then under threat from going bust, causing more unemployed, fewer incomes, more poverty, higher government debt, and ultimately default. Standard recession story. Basically we really, really don't want deflation, hence why governments tend to target 2% inflation rather than just a flat 0%.

Having a small amount of inflation is good as well for dealing with debt - it gradually erodes the value of debt, and so incentivises borrowing and USING money for productive value rather than just letting it sit there. If you know your 100k savings will be worth less next year than it is now, due to inflation, you'll be more likely to invest it in something productive, like a house, or company shares which deliver above inflation returns. If everyone does that, its better for the economy than if everyone's cash is just sitting under their mattress.

There are more reasons, again any decent textbook should have a good section on this. Or economics forums, type in ""Economics help deflation"".

&gt;Also, would you care to comment on why printing money backed by nothing beyond the promises of a government is good?

Another one that could take an entire undergraduate module to fully understand. But simply, lets look at the alternative. In 1929, we went into recession following a stock market crash and the economic orthodoxy at the time was to protect the value of money by tying it to gold (the Gold Standard). The effect was to reduce the money supply in the economy, which had a deflationary affect, which ultimately led to the Great Depression, thousands of unemployed, poverty, suicides, Hitler, World War 2, and so on. All to ""save the value of the dollar"", which was pointless anyway seeing as the value of real US assets declined by 90% over the next few years anyway. What good was saving the dollar's value when the whole economy was destroyed as a consequence? People's dollars might have been worth more, but that didn't matter when the banks holding those dollars went under, or the assets those dollars bought fell in value.

Fortunately in the 1930s a genius economist called Keynes came along and showed us recessions were a market failure, and governments could reflate the economy with fiscal policy without crowding out private investment (as ultimately happened in the New Deal and to a larger extend World War 2, which saved the US economy). Later this idea was expanded on by monetarists like Milton Friedman, who showed that expanding the money supply could have a similar effect. And it doesn't lead to inflation when the economy is depressed, because the ""velocity"" of money remains low. Look up the equation MV = PT to understand why increasing the money supply doesn't necessarily lead to inflation.

What happens in layman's terms, is basically the Fed prints a bunch of money and purchases government bonds. (Note, if there's any sign of inflation this money can be removed from the economy just as fast by selling those bonds). The government can then use that money to expand fiscal policy and raise Aggregate Demand. So long as the productive capacity of the economy hasn't been reached, there will be no demand-pull inflation. The extra government spending is just replacing Demand lost by the fall in private sector consumption and Investment.

The Fed also sometimes buys private sector bonds. The money then sits in banks and supposedly gives the banks greater liquidity with which they can lend to private sector firms. This would increase Aggregate Demand too, although it's debatable how much money is actually used for its intended purpose - much just stays sitting on those balance sheets.

The idea that the value of money is always being eroded when the money supply is expanded is a fallacy. People were warning this would happen in 2009 (mainly Republicans and supply side economists) and were all proved wrong. Look up Ron Paul, a gold-bug who's been wrong on everything.

Look at how much QE the Central Banks have enacted over the last 12 years in the US, UK, EU, Japan, and elsewhere. Loads. And look at the average rate of inflation. Generally well below the 2% target. We WANT it to be higher, and in spite of all that printing money, we couldn't even get it to reach our target.

I'm not sure if this has all been clear - there's probably a lot of economics jargon in my answer but it would take too much time to explain each term. Really if you want a fuller understanding of these concepts I'd recommend picking up an economics textbook, or perhaps typing in your questions to Google. Lots of economics blogs explain these concepts very thoroughly. Paul Krugman will have lots of articles on it, amongst others."

Combined the effects and you get lost jobs, poverty, and no incentive to produce goods/services. Just my newbie thoughts off the top of my head so someone please correct me if I'm mistaken."
2020-04-29 20:48:51,Can you comment on how negative interest rates exist haha
2020-04-29 20:47:42,"i'm not an economist, but from my understanding deflation might lead to a downward spiral of reducing consumption.   


Continual reduction in prices might lead to people deciding not to spend (if that TV was say $1000 a month ago and its $900 now and looks to be $800 next month, you might decide to continue holding off to get it cheaper, and while not all goods can be held off indefinitely, a sizeable chunk of the economy would be hurt by this) This in turn might lead to less revenue for producers, leading them to potentially cut workers, leading them to have less income to spend, leading them to buy less goods, less revenue again and etc. Of course, i'm not saying runaway inflation is good either, but a small amount of inflation over time i think is preferable to deflation overall  


As for Fiat, let me caveat with I don't believe that unlimited printing is a good thing, but from my understanding again, Fiat isnt necessarily backed by nothing beyond the promises of a government. Let me back up first and say that any currency has value only because people think it has value, whether that is paper currency, gold or digital currencies. People think these various currencies have value because of what they can buy with them. So as long as there is demand for a country's goods and services, that country's currency will continue to have value. Now if the government were to frivolously print money, it might lead to a loss in faith in that country's currency, and if that country isnt producing a good or service that isnt easily replaceable by another country who is more fiscally responsible, then you might see that country's currency become essentially worthless"

2021-08-12 13:11:01,"Some of what he's saying doesn't make that much sense to me. 

The actions taken by the government were along pretty well-defined lines of anti-trust/data-security. It doesn't follow that those actions would have a large effect on families with political ties to those companies. The government is trying to control distribution of wealth and national security. It hardly seems like a political pissing contest would rank high in the reasons for action.

At around 6:15 he seems to be implying that the effect on US listed stocks was greater than the effect on Chinese-listed stocks. If that is so, it would be because of foreign investors getting nervous and bailing on positions. It doesn't seem logical that the Chinese government was using surgical precision with regulation to symmetrically  hurt U.S. listings over their own. These are actions against companies, not against stock listings.

At around 7:11, he states that the Chinese government would rather foreign investors put their money directly in their stock market. I believe foreigners aren't allowed to own stocks on the Shanghai market. Unless we are talking about secondary listings in HK (which he didn't mention), I have no idea what his specific point it. 

As far as VIEs, it's not really a breaking news story or ""insanely risky"". They've been used for a long while, including foreign companies other than Chinese-listed ones. Yes, China could make the structure illegal--which would make foreign investor confidence fall to nothing. China may have a long-game of getting new listings back to their home markets, but I can't see how it's going to be a quick pull of the rug, or why they would intentionally destroy foreign capital infusions. New companies from China list on U.S. markets every week, a trend that seems nowhere near slowing down.

That firms like Blackrock, GS, Fidelity, etc didn't bail out on their shares, says a lot about how they view the long-term profitability of their China investments as still in place. When we see the large players unloading their own stakes, then that would be a serious cause for concern. 

He undermines a lot of his arguments by the hyperbolic political statements and satirical swipes. Is the video really saying the ultimate wisdom on the subject is Jim Cramer? I prefer my stock analysis without all the clever yuk-yuks. There are good reasons to not be invested in China right now. I just don't understand why the points being made always seem to have mentions of mostly unrelated political and cultural differences."

There's no real counter argument if you don't consider the political freedom of a billion people important enough, or believe that they can run an efficient, non-oppressive government. I don't believe that. It may work for now, but let's see in a generation. China will do what China does."

2021-08-12 10:14:19,"It's not that simple. China is actually one of the biggest net creditor nations. That means more investment capital flows out of the country than into the country, as in China investing more in foreign markets than foreign markets invest in China. Not by a small amount either. Capital flow as an indicator of prosperity is quite clearly a hit and miss though, because it highly depends on where that capital is coming from.

In any case, even if foreign capital flow into China specifically slowed down, the external investment positions and their growth can supplement that for a long, long time to come. And assuming China made the right investments, the capital flow will just go through a 3rd party straight into China. As long as we outsource into places with Chinese influence, China profits. In a somewhat loaded statement, the ""colonized"" became the ""colonizers"", after all, they learned from the best."

If you mean how much it might move on the basis of intrinsic value... well, you can think about what that scenario looks like and make an estimate. Have to figure out what margins will be in that scenario and then apply some kind of normal market multiple I suppose."

You’ll want to create a historical data set to begin to understand how they work. Over time, understand revenue drivers. Is it customers times price? Is it organic growth rates and license sales, which create recurring maintenance revenue? Or something else?

Then work your way down to expenses. What is the profitability of each revenue line item? 

Then go down to the other expenses like marketing/sales, R&amp;D, etc. Compare these to a metric like revenue or maintenance revenue. 

Your goal is to then look at all of these and understand how and why they change over time, but also what exactly they represent. 

Some items that are not always disclosed, but you’ll see are relevant, including the years a customer remains with the company. Some refer this as a churn rate.

Once you know those basics, the book, The Real Story of Informix Software, will teach you why the markets paid so much attention to a few of the metrics, namely license revenue. It’s probably not officially an investing book, but when you want to learn one of the most important drivers, this is it."

2021-08-10 11:57:27,"Does anyone have any experience valuing a company with lots of VIE debt? Specifically I am looking at Golar (GLNG), which is a LNG shipper and producer.

I have heard from people that it is ""cheap"" yet when I use the company's outlook and even make the projections a bit more optimistic, I'm getting share values that are below or just above current market price, and considering a lot of the revenues are dependant on commodity prices, I think the market would require an even larger discount (model a higher share price but only be willing to pay lower), so I think I'm handling the debts wrong.

So for Golar, they consolidated all of their VIE debt, and the VIEs are created to buy and lease back their ships to them. Importantly, they have agreements to buy back the ships at the end of the lease term. 

So for the debt values in calculating enterprise value, I included the book values from the consolidated balance sheet. Now I don't know if there are any guarantees from GLNG regarding the debt, but if they don't make lease payments they don't get use of their asset and cannot make more revenues, so I think it's reasonable to use the consolidated figure. However, I'm thinking that perhaps the consolidation does not take into account the repurchase agreement at lease end?

So if the VIE lists $100 of debt for the purchase of a ship that it leases out, but has an agreement to sell the ship for $20 in ten years, should I reduce the debt values by the PV of the repurchase?"

Trust me, I'm not. Once *we* finish learning DCF 101, I'll be able to circle back to my original point."
2021-08-04 22:28:20,"You're almost there. 

Tell me what happens when you use your terminal growth rate for all phases of your DCF?"
2021-08-04 21:34:09,"And before you start googling again...

You're just getting farther and farther away from your original claim that DCF is ""like"" P/E in any way, since market price never once enters into the equation considering that the components of Fair Value, Weighted Average Cost of Capital, Forecasted Cash Flows, and Terminal Value, do not anywhere invoke market price in any way, shape, or form.  Also, earnings and cash flows are not one and the same... so even if we created a ""Fair Value Ratio"" what would we compare it to?  Comparing it to earnings misses the point, since cash flow and earnings are apples and oranges.  Comparing it to market price (or market cap, rather) is more relevant, but then it's entirely different from P/E but still apples and oranges because P/E uses earnings at a point in time, not a stream of all future earnings discounted to present value."
2021-08-04 21:08:51,"You're almost there... except quoting directly from Investopedia almost word for word.

Terminal value is only the present value at a future point in time of cash flows beyond the forecast period.

The last step in DCF is to discount the forecast period and the terminal value to net present value.

This is expressed as:

Fair Value = CF / (1+r)^(t) \+ TV/(1+r)^(N)"
2021-08-04 20:29:55,"&gt;The entire point of DCF is to calculate the present value of a company's future cash flows, using cost of capital as the discount rate.
&gt;
&gt;Terminal value is the exact opposite.
&gt;
&gt;Kind of hard to confuse the two.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Yes, Terminal Value appears on multiple sites, but ONLY einvestingforbeginners uses the wrong version that you copy-pasted... and while I'm not going to outright do your homework for you and tell you why it's the wrong one, a hint is in this comment. But, again, even if you used the right Terminal Value calc, it's still the wrong answer. 

Yikes. Terminal value *is* the net present value of future cash flows... it's literally the last phase in a DCF. Do a DCF (out to infinity) using a constant growth rate, and compare the answer to the terminal value equation. They'll be the same."

""looks an awful lot like"" ≠ is"
2021-08-04 18:49:49,"&gt;Any multiple where the numerator is market price has no relation to DCF.

So this just isn't true. If you're looking at a simple DCF case where growth is constant forever, the equation for intrinsic value is:

FV = FCF × (1 + g) / (DR - g)

If you divide both sides by FCF, you get something that looks an awful lot like a PE ratio on the left hand side. You can plug in your growth rate and COE on the right hand side and get what an estimate for what a reasonable PE is - assuming a longterm growth rate of 2% and a COE of 7% , fair value will be trading at 20.4 times earnings (or FCF).

It's not an exact science, but it's not useless, and it's absolutely related to DCF."

Analysis should mention how a company’s business, assets, earnings, industry, or other factors makes the security you’re discussing undervalued or overvalued. You can find examples of what NOT to post here, here, here, or here. If those examples don’t make it clear, posts probing for “Thoughts” while producing no analysis are actively discouraged.

&gt;For excellent examples of what to post, look at what pershingcubed did here, what redcards did here, what spyflo &amp; team did here, or what hedgefundaspirations did here. While these posts provide more extensive examples of analysis, posts looking to discuss individual securities need not be this thorough. We desire to keep the discussion in this sub high level and want to prevent it from devolving into mindless chatter. Your post will be deleted if it does not contain any analysis as baseless speculation helps no one. It is better to say nothing than to spread misinformation. Please downvote posts that attempt to discuss individual securities with no analysis and we will remove them as soon as we can.

Don't think you can necessarily hide in low beta stocks either. Possible their margins get crunched and stock gets hit.

The best thing to buy in an inflationary environment are stocks with pricing power in that environment and not priced correctly, which can frankly vary depending on the environment, or commodity companies that are driving inflation but not seeing large surges in their cost base.

2021-11-05 10:04:25,"Highlights:

&gt; For the past quarter of a century, the performance of bonds and equities have been inversely related: at times when the stock market has declined, government bonds usually delivered positive returns. Conventional portfolios, allocating 60% to equities and 40% to bonds, have done well. But as inflation returns, bonds and equities are likely to become positively correlated, rising and falling together, as they did in the 1970s. This means investors will have to rethink their asset allocation.

&gt; In particular, they must consider how to reduce the sensitivity of portfolios to rising interest rates – what’s technically known as “duration risk”. The duration risk of the U.S. corporate bond market is at an all-time high. American stocks also have more duration than at any time since the dot-com bubble. Investors can reduce this risk by buying cheaper stocks. Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, also speaking at the Grant’s conference this week, points out that value stocks in emerging markets, Japan, Europe and the United Kingdom are currently trading at very attractive valuations.

&gt; Above all, says Maxey, investors must be nimble. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it’s also useful to hold more cash – the shortest duration asset – as markets become more volatile. The real value of cash may be eroded by inflation, but at least it provides investors with a means to buy assets when they become cheap."

2020-01-26 13:56:34,"&gt; So, it might be true that Chanos beat the ""index"" by 15%, but that might be irrelevant if the index is going to keep doing horrendously for the foreseeable future.

In an interview he says that the short only fund is offered as an hedge, or within a market neutral fund, or within a fund that goes 190/90 long the index short this portfolio, which leaves you net long 100%.

In that case you get to eat your sharpe. If he has been able to keep returns nominally negative from 2009 on, you'd be getting about *twice* the performance of the already insane performance of the index. At the same time I can't see how this short portion wouldn't have made money in the GFC."
2020-01-26 13:05:46,"I have a feeling that this is venturing into a sort of philosophical discussion. Using factor exposures and risk-adjusted performance to evaluate performance make perfect sense in the framework of academic finance, but at the same time, ""you can't eat your Sharpe"" and you can't directly invest in factors. So, it might be true that Chanos beat the ""index"" by 15%, but that might be irrelevant if the index is going to keep doing horrendously for the foreseeable future.
 
Charlie Munger makes an interesting point, somewhere in *Seeking Wisdom* I believe. He prefers thinking in terms of ""opportunity cost"" rather than ""cost of capital"". So even if there's a strong argument that Chanos has been crushing the index, Munger might argue that there would still be no reason to give him your money when that would stop you from putting money in the hands of someone like Allen Mecham."

2020-01-26 12:54:18,"Thanks for the great explanation. That's why I'm asking whether it's as awesome of a return as it sounds to me.

I think he does say that this is intended to be used as a hedge to be able to go more long the market in general.

As far as I understand, that's a short only fund, so beta -1 (more or less, depending on the beta of what he shorts).

*IF* I understand your explanation, and ignoring the risk free return to make calculations easier, if rougher, then, the alpha of this fund for 2004 is -5.1%, because he returned -15.8% and the SPY returned +10.9%.

If that's (roughly) right, then his alpha would be:

* '93: -33%
* '94: +47.5%
* '95: -3.3%
* '96: +8.8%
* '97: +38.6%
* '98: +27.3%
* '99: +20.2%
* '00: +38.2%
* '01: +6.3%
* '02: +13.2
* '03: -3.7%
* '04: -5.1%

Very volatile, but generally lots of alpha. In this case, I think this is what he would have (roughly) made if he also was 1x long the SPY and 1x short this stuff?

Over this decade of data, that'd be +235%, which is 10.6% CAGR, for the market neutral version of this."

2020-01-26 11:58:00,"In financial theory, the return necessary to be “worth it” is not determined in a vacuum, but rather relies on the systemic risk and volatility that the investment is exposed to. We call that systemic risk “beta” and any returns in excess of beta “alpha.” Judging a return of 10% or 5% is meaningless unless you also consider the beta the investment is exposed to (ex ante) or the actual return of a benchmark of similar risks (ex post) over the observed time period.

Shorting the market has a -1 beta, so the required return for that investment to have achieved its cost of capital is risk free rate + (-1)*MRP (the market risk premium, let’s say its 5%) which adds up to about -3%. So if you are invested in a short only fund that expects to return 0%, you will achieve 3pp of alpha. 

Now, to get a -1 beta fund you’d have to basically short the market and invest the cash you received from that short position into the risk free security. If he is actually using that cash to put on long positions, then his portfolios beta is likely 0ish, in which case he needs to beat the risk free rate to have generated alpha (rfr + 0*MRP = rfr).

However if this was over the last 10 years where the market has gone absolutely nuts up, and he has had a negative beta portfolio, then 2% is amazing because his benchmark would say he returned like -13%. If he was beta neutral, then 2% sucks because he could have just invested in treasuries."

2020-01-25 08:33:25,"Great work and interesting stuff.

I see why you are interested in this company. Their accounting issues may have lead to their stock being greatly undervalued.

People here seem to miss the fact of what you are trying to accomplish, you are trying to find enough information to obtain a reasonable measure of confidence that the business is sound, even if their accounting isn’t for the moment.

You bring up revenues and gross margin numbers a lot but net profit  and cash flow is what really matters in my mind. If they are reasonably profitable then their increase in book value and revenue will justify a higher stock price.

I am happy to do some more research with you. I would like to see estimated profit by company acquired. By looking at similar companies as the ones they acquired  it may be possible to gauge the cash flows and profitability. 

At this point if the company runs out of cash it is dead. No one will lend to them most likely. However, they could be a diamond in the rough. Operationally they may have done well, but they definitely screwed up royally by not getting their accounting in order. 

Let’s see if we can pull together some better info to determine if they have a chance of surviving."

Something smells fishy. TD doesn't have 10-Q and 10-K docs. I guess because they're Canadian? Here's what they do have:

2020-01-25 02:43:21,"Robinhood was the first broker with zero-commission trades which started 5 or 6 years ago and then all of the other brokers (including TD) reduced the commissions on their trades to $0 within the past six months. So as a result, TD charges less for trades = lower gross margin = lower free cash flow margin. 

Cash flows are recorded quarterly in a company's financial statements. You can find it on EDGAR but these companies should have their SEC filings under the Investor Relations section on the website. Once you find the document (10-Q and 10-K are the documents you're looking for), search for ""consolidated statement of cash flows"" and you should find it. 

Maybe you already know but free cash flow = (cash flow from operations) - (capital expenditures) which is why i brought cash flow from operations up. It'll help you figure out why their free cash flow changed so much."

It’s up to GameStop to make their market again. The video game industry has changed a lot in the last 5-10 years or so with how games are developed and monetized. disruptors like rising development costs, digital sales, more accessible mobile gaming, twitch and streaming/viral marketing culture. Amazon partnered with twitch for this reason, content in the games have surprising value now. Fortnite has been like the top one to beat for a couple years as far as making money, and the game is free. Sony caved finally on letting their network go cross platform because the winners aren’t going to be based on units sold now. Exclusive content, like spider man for them during the time of the marvel peak.

Last but not least Fortnite proved once and for all if you want to make money simply keep people engaged and regularly playing to incentivize them to spend after the initial purchase. Even if it’s in small purchases over time. That’s where dlc and selling undeveloped content failed. Not that GameStop doesn’t already try and do this, but if they push harder or fork up some more money to drive exclusive sales or content that people want then they will come to buy it lol"

2022-02-06 22:30:48,"Super underrated section hey:

&gt;	I was listening to the Q4 call and there’s this really smart analyst called Sebastian. That’s the name of my sister’s cat, and he pointed this out. There’s something really interesting happening with TSMC’s CAPEX and their future revenue. If you take the CAPEX for a year, multiply it by about three times, you can broadly predict revenues for the next year. And it makes sense generally because it generally takes a fab a year to get on track. So this trend has been going on basically for a decade.


&gt;	**In 2014, they spent $10 billion in CAPEX. A year later in 2015, they generate $30 billion revenue. 2019, they spent $16.6 billion in CAPEX, they generated $48.4 billion in revenues a year later, 2020. 2020, they spent $18.3 billion CAPEX. In 2021, they generate $56.8 billion. So in 2021, TSMC spent $30 billion in CAPEX. So does that mean in 2022, TSMC is going to make $90 billion in revenue? ** So, I’ve seen other conservative estimates saying like $72 billion and even their financial projections say its CAGR is going to be 10% to 15%.

&gt;	But let’s say the three times does hold, they make $90 billion in revenue. At 38% net profit margin, that’s $34 billion in net profit. That’s ExxonMobil in 2003. That’s Google/Alphabet in 2019. And the even crazier thing is like 2022, TSMC says they’re going to spend 40 to 44 billion dollars. So if they hit the high case for that CAPEX, does that mean like in 2023 is TSMC going to make $130 billion in revenue? And if you still have that same net profit margin, that’s $53 billion in profit. That’s more than Microsoft in 2020 and the same as Apple in 2020.

&gt;	So, it’s kind of mind blowing. That basically means at a 20 times PE that’s a trillion dollar company, and I think that’s insane. That’s insane. And I actually don’t believe it’s true. It can’t be true, like I refuse to believe it’s true. So let’s say we compress the multiple, but still means this is an 800 to 900 billion-dollar company. It’s crazy.

&gt;	So I think maybe the reason why this company is so highly valued is because it’s actually quite simple. It’s a very conservative company. It’s very simple to understand. It’s very transparent. Revenues are reported each month, and this leading indicator that’s used, that’s worked for nine past years is flashing this utterly insane amount of growth. It’s crazy.

&gt;	And especially considering that this is not a software company, this is a hardware company making things. Their past 10-year revenue CAGR was 14%. Over the last 10 years, they’ve grown revenue by 14%. They’re saying like long term, next several years, they’re going to expect their revenue to be 15% to 20% CAGR. That’s crazy. Even larger base, even faster. They’re going to grow even faster than that, which is really interesting.

&gt;	Kalani Scarrott (34:41): Yeah. There’s so many points there because it’s the growth on an already large base number. And then even just the margins for a hardware business, they’re unheard of. There’s just so many factors going for it. And it’s maybe a bit of a story as well because the strategic importance and the digital transition, everyone just loves that story. And TSMC is leading the way, I guess.

&gt;	Jon (Asianometry) (34:58): Yeah. And it says like they have, what, 50% market share, 57% right now, which is more than they traditionally target, which basically means if you think about it, the fabless market is TSMC. So that’s telling you that the industry is going to grow even just as fast. People are estimating … I read this article somewhere that says like the fabulous companies, their revenue estimates are way too low.

&gt;	If you look at how TSMC is looking at, TSMC is projecting this sort of growth and fabless companies are projecting like 9%, you need to revise those up. Nvidia, AMD, all these companies, they’re going to grow much faster than you think."

I don't know the details of the Oaktree loan, but it sounds bridgey, so over an assumed eighteen to twenty four month life the rate of return  was likely low to mid teens. This is a great return for the amount of capital they deployed, but it is far from insane. One may also question whether it is too low of a return given the political and property rights risk they assumed, although sounds like they figured it out.

2022-02-04 08:45:30,"Ahead of Q4/21 results, here is my latest model.

https://i.imgur.com/ezQlRZ0.png

* I believe I'm a little low on ASPs for Q4 and probably slightly high for Q2/22. I never put much weight into more than +6mths. Once we get to June I'll know the summer fill programs and have accurate pricing for Q3.
* I also updated the 45Q valuation. Result is the value decreasing to $36M under current legislation. Additional notes are below for those who are interested.

**Q4/21 Results**

I've been going through Q4 preview research reports and I think there's a compelling case for CVRP's Q4/21 results having a material surprise to the upside. We know they usually report ASPs in-line or slightly above CF Industries. Here is how the 3 brokers I've seen stack up for CF's Q4 (volumes are in thousands).

BMO| Volume| ASP
---|---|----
NH3| 1,000 st| $671/st
UAN| 1,850 st| $448/st

RBC| Volume| ASP
---|---|----
NH3| 991 st| $680/st
UAN| 1,654 st| $420/st

Scotia| Volume| ASP
---|---|----
NH3| 1,100 st| $675/st
UAN| 1,950 st| $400/st

These are all record Q4 volumes of NH3. Even if I use the lowest of all of those ASP estimates, my own (admittedly conservative) model is +30% low on the distribution. I'm beginning to think we might finally see a quarterly surprise on the upside.

My own estimate for CVRP Q4 ASPs is:
NH3 - $630
UAN - $343


**45Q Monetization**

Management indicated they expect to announce a deal with a Tax Equity Partner in Q1/22. Since then, I re-read the Norton Rose white paper after the Q3 calls. They didn't define CO2 and CO2e but it appears that nitrous oxide may not qualify for 45Qs (45Q CO2e definition includes only carbon dioxide and monoxide). The comments made on the LXU call seem to confirm this. See pg 21, ""Emissions Covered"".

If this is true, and it appears it is, my previous calculation of the 45Qs is incorrect under the current legislation. From the LXU call it sounds like they're trying to get nitrous oxide added to the new bill but we can't count on that. I went back to the 10K and Coffeyville has CO2 sequestration as well as N2O abatement. However, they do not break out how much. Instead, all numbers are presented as CO2e (nitrous oxide equivalent is 300x CO2). Here is the paragraph below from the 10k:

&gt; Recent Greenhouse Gas Footprint Reduction Efforts In October 2020, the Partnership announced that it generated its first carbon offset credits from voluntary nitrous oxide abatement at its Coffeyville Facility. The Partnership has similar nitrous oxide abatement efforts at its East Dubuque Facility. According to the EPA, nitrous oxide represents approximately 7% of carbon dioxide-equivalent (“CO2e”) emissions in the United States. The Partnership previously entered into a Joint Development Agreement with ClimeCo, a pioneer in the development of emission-reduction projects for nitric acid plants, to jointly design, install and operate a tertiary abatement system at one of its nitric acid plants in Coffeyville. The system was designed to abate 94% of all N2O in the unit while preventing the release of approximately 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent on an annualized basis. The N2O abatement systems at the East Dubuque Facility’s two nitric acid plants have abated, on average, the annual release of approximately 233,000 metric tons of CO2e during the past five years. CVR Partners’ N2O abatement projects are registered with the Climate Action Reserve (the “Reserve”), a carbon offset registry for the North American market. The Reserve employs high-quality standards and an independent third-party verification process to issue its carbon credits, known as Climate Reserve Tonnes. The Partnership also sequesters carbon dioxide that is not utilized for urea production at its Coffeyville Facility by capturing and purifying the CO2 as part of its manufacturing process and then transferred to its partner, Perdure Petroleum LLC, that compresses and ships the CO2 for sequestration through Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”). In January 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations under Section 45Q which provides tax credits to encourage CO2 sequestration. We believe that our process for CO2 sequestration would qualify for tax credits under Section 45Q and intend to pursue a claim of those credits starting in 2021. Combining our nitrous oxide abatement and CO2 sequestration activities reduces our CO2e footprint by over 1 million metric tons per year. In addition, our Coffeyville Facility is uniquely qualified to produce hydrogen and ammonia that could be certified ‘blue’ to a market that is increasingly demanding reduced carbon footprints. These greenhouse gas footprint reduction efforts support our core Values of Environment and Continuous Improvement, and our goal of continuing to produce nitrogen fertilizers that feed the world’s growing population in the most environmentally responsible way possible.

Using the verbiage from the paragraph implies actual CO2 sequestration is about 320,000 tonnes annually. This cuts the 45Q monetization to $36M instead of the previous &gt;$100M. There wasn't a definition of CO2e in the white paper so the 45Q eligible CO2e tonnes are less than those stated in the 10K. There is a chance CO2e is included in the revised legislation and the value would revert to the previous analysis. Fortunately, the 45Qs aren't very material to the overall valuation anymore."

2022-02-03 08:54:26,"&gt;I’m still curious about the public shareholders’ claim to profits

No problem.  The economic interest in the public company is entirely held by the class A shares in the public company.  The public company’s share of the profits in the operation is based on the public company’s ownership of the LLC.  To oversimplify imagine there’s a pot of 10 dollar bills.  The pre IPO shareholders own 40% of the pot and 4 class B shres in the public company and the public company owns 60% of the pot and has 6 class A shares outstanding.  The pot can be thought of as having 10 shares, and the class A shares should trade for $1 each.  To extend this to your example, assuming the $27B is the class A sharecount multiplied by the 15x revenues is the right number for the reason you outline.

You say that no other company you’ve seen looks like this, but I just want to point out that up-cs are very common.

&gt;	I don’t believe they are doing this by cashing out the pre-IPO shares, but are simply issuing them and diluting the public shares

This is true to the extent the company is raising capital, yes.  If the pre-ipo holders are selling, this is not true.  Remember, the LLC owners will *exchange* their LLC units for public shares (or cash that the public company raises by selling new shares), and in doing so the public company’s ownership of the LLC will increase.  Done this way the sales by insiders will increase increase the number of class a shares outstanding of CVNA but it doesn’t dilute a CVNA shareholder’s ownership of the *business*, though of course their ownership percentage of the public company goes down.  To extend the simplified example above, imagine the pre IPO shareholders owning 40% of the pot say “hey, public company, here’s 40% of the pot, I’d like 4 class a shares in you please.”  If you owned one of the preexisting Class As, you are “diluted” in the sense that you owned 1/6th of the public company before and now you own 1/10th, and the number of class A shares just went up by 67% but you still own $1 of value.  Does that help?

(To be clear I am not reading through CVNA’s statements in detail but rather applying what I did see to the typical up-c structure and using data provided by you where needed.  Do not take this as investing advice.)"
2022-02-03 08:00:33,"That being said, I doubt investors will have any recourse when this thing blows up. They've written it all out in their filings (even though it's incredibly complex)."
2022-02-03 07:56:27,[removed]
2022-02-03 07:07:12,"Thank you, that is extremely helpful indeed! Especially about why the ownership structure is such. 

But I'm still curious about the public shareholders' claim to profits. In other words, are we actually full owners of the company that could make money in the future, and are we entitled to 100% of those profits, or does the ownership structure allow for them to only distribute, say, 33% of the total profits among all public shareholders? Because, in that case, while CVNA has a current market cap of 27B and might look to be trading at only 5X revenues, it would actually be the same as if it had a market cap of 81B (27B / 0.33) or trading at 15X revenues, if that makes sense? 

If you look at their annual statements, say, 2020, the net income after tax is -462m while the net income after tax to common shareholders is only -171m (about a third). No other company I know has such a discrepancy so I wonder if this is a direct consequence of the ownership structure.

&gt; You are just buying a share from someone else who happens to be selling.

This does not refute anything you said in your paragraph, but just to add more info, it does seem like the owners have been issuing more public shares in the last 4 years since IPO as well to raise capital (available shares have increased 4x in 4 years). I don't believe they are doing this by cashing out the pre-IPO shares, but are simply issuing them and diluting the public shares."

Google around for more about the structure ([here](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/trust-solutions/accounting-advisory/up-c-structure.html), [here](https://www.mayerbrown.com/-/media/files/perspectives-events/publications/2019/05/on-point—upc-structure-7311324018converted.pdf) and [here](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=475a3baf-32cf-48ca-bb19-47e99887584b))

Obviously there are a lot of moving pieces but basically it allows the owners of the stock pre-IPO to not hold public shares until they are ready to sell their interests in the company.  When the exchange is made of the LLC interests for public company shares, the public company gets a “step up” in the assets, which will shield income from taxes in the future.  The higher the price when that exchange is made, the higher the depreciation shield.  If the stock trades up post IPO, this can be very valuable.  In addition, the pre-IPO owners will not be subject to double taxation on their ownership as they will own LLC interests and not corporate stock.

You are not quite right about what happens when you (*you*) buy a share in CVNA.  You are just buying a share from someone else who happens to be selling.  If a *pre IPO owner* wants to cash out, they take their LLC unit and a Class B unit to Carvana and say “hey! I want to exchange these for one CVNA share please.”  *Then* that CVNA share can be sold to someone like you.  (When CVNA hands over the share to the insider it gets that sweet, sweet stepup in the assets allocated to that one LLC unit)

Oh, one more thing.  You know the tax benefits that come from that depreciation?  In CVNA’s case, some (all?) of the cash value of those benefits are paid in cash to the pre-IPO holders.  See the third link above.

That was a lot. I hope it helps."

Even if it was similar my concern would be they started with a low churn because they grew through their most profitable niche of hard-core workout fiends. When COVID  fades the fear is their churn will grow as they can only grow by acquiring more typical customers who won't be as committed.

The question here is how would one receive cash back or does one trust management to use the cash, over time, in a manner that would be accretive to shareholders?

One way is to consider a control premium (class B voting stock here) and discount structure.  An old article below is saying about 3% discount.

Another way to look at this is, should you do business with a crook?  And if you did, what would you expect that crook to do, act as your partner or rip you off every chance he gets?  The way I discount personally is I discount these types of guys to 100%.  I just would hate to see how they are ripping me off every time I look at them.  If I made money, it would be completely accidental to what they are trying to accomplish (taking all of the money they can).

Model out a cohort of 1,000 users.

Multiply these to get gross profit for the month. Repeat this over many months until you get to 0 remaining customers, or meaningfully close anyway.

You can then discount all of these cash flows individually. Maybe that has a nuance or two to the calculation though.

If you want to do the above and share a file, I can make suggestions and help you learn through the process. 

I will caution you that LTV and CAC estimates are really just one piece of the puzzle as equity analysts.

Paying artists $0.003 per stream and at most $5500 per every million streams is the fast food equivalent to music streaming, and is an unreliable business model in the long run.

	Tiger Global has been hit by losses of around $17bn during this year’s technology stock sell-off, marking one of the biggest dollar declines for a hedge fund in history.

The run of poor performance means the firm — one of the world’s biggest hedge funds and a big investor in high-growth, speculative companies whose shares have tumbled since their pandemic peaks — has in four months erased around two-thirds of its gains since its launch in 2001, according to calculations by LCH Investments.

“The magnitude of the loss is breathtaking, especially for a fund with ‘hedge’ in its name,” said Andrew Beer, managing member at investment firm Dynamic Beta. “This shows how even the most talented and plugged-in tech investors failed to see the train coming down the tracks.”

The losses were estimated by LCH, a fund of hedge funds run by the Edmond de Rothschild Group, which is an authority on dollar gains and losses made by hedge funds for their clients and which compiles an annual list of the world’s top money managers.

Tiger declined to comment. Investors who put money into the fund at launch have made more than 20 times their initial investment, said a person familiar with the fund.

Still, the losses eclipse some of the $4tn hedge fund industry’s biggest drops of recent years. These include the $12.1bn lost by investment giant Bridgewater in 2020 during the market tumult caused by the coronavirus pandemic, or Melvin Capital’s loss of approximately $7bn during the GameStop retail trading frenzy at the start of last year.

New York-based Tiger, which recently managed around $90bn in assets, was founded 21 years ago by Chase Coleman, a so-called “Tiger cub” who worked at legendary investor Julian Robertson’s hedge fund Tiger Management.

Coleman’s fund has in the past made huge gains for investors, helped by punchy bets on tech stocks. By the start of 2021 he was ranked by LCH as the 14th best-performing hedge fund manager of all time, having made $10.4bn of gains, or a return of 48 per cent, for investors the previous year and a total of $26.5bn since launch.

But his fund has been badly knocked during the recent sell-off in speculative assets, as the Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates to curb inflation has damped the appeal of high-growth companies whose investment cases are often predicated on the promise of earnings far out in to the future.

The fund lost 43.7 per cent in the first four months of this year, the Financial Times reported earlier this month, more than double the 21 per cent decline posted by Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite share gauge.

Tiger’s dollar losses, which are for its hedge fund rather than its private equity business, do not include the impact of a tech sell-off late last year, which left Tiger down 7 per cent for the whole of 2021."
2022-05-09 23:01:40,"True, over the long run homes will match or exceed inflation. My concern is the short run. Anyone who paid $1M for a home because their payments were only $3,000 a month is going to find it hard to sell it when the buyers payments would need to be $5,000 a month. The next year or two could be horrific for housing if mortgage rights keep rising. They never rose this quickly in the 70s.

Secondly, the millenial cohort is not much bigger than the cohort between it and the boomer cohort, and boomers still own and buy houses too. Demographics offer very minor changes in demand, especially when birth rates have fallen below replacement levels."

""Building Materials (Positions Not Currently Disclosed)  
We own shares of two companies that produce and distribute building materials, primarily for the home building industry. Both companies trade at mid-single digit cash flow multiples and are using the cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiples are due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, these businesses do not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a  
new baseline for earnings. """

2022-05-08 15:12:44,"When you want to estimate available housing inventory, methinks I wouldn't uncritically use housing salesmen for my data source. 

When you want to estimate the effects of demographics, I wouldn't use a standard demographic chart as an example of some future demand surge. Hint: There are always less people in older brackets because people have a nasty habit of slowly dying off.

Finally, I wouldn't pin my whole thesis on the effects of 5% mortgage rates when they are already in our rear view mirror. If current inflation rates (8.5%) persist we'd need 10% mortgage rates. At even 7% it's a housing market apocalypse.

Think critically about what happened in the market when rates fell from 6.5% in mid-2008 to 2.9% in mid 2021. Do you think a lot of people made a lot of money on real estate during that period. Maybe a lot of people decided to buy second and third homes again since it was such an easy path to riches? What are they going to do with their second homes now?

Lastly, the fact that mortgage payments don't track rates one for one doesn't mean mortgage costs don't, they do exactly. Increasing the interest rate from 3 to 6% only increases the payment on a $400k mortgage from $1,700 to $2,400. But the $1,700 payment is $700 principle, meaning the actual costs only $1,000 per month in interest. The $2,400 payment costs $2,000 a month in interest, it's barely paying down the loan $400 a month.  The 6% buyer is far more dependent on further appreciation to build equity.

Sure some buyers only fixate on monthly payments, but over time the market is a weighing machine and a large number of buyers being stuck in high interest mortgages on property with limited equity that isn't appreciating is going to undercut that myth that real estate is the path to easy riches, and demand."

2022-05-06 17:59:16,"&gt;On the long side, Upslope’s portfolio has historically leaned 2:1 in favor of “Core” (quality) vs. “Tactical” (value) holdings.

It sounds like Upslopes utilizes a barbell approach for its long portfolio. Typically 66% is weighted in high-quality 'core' holdings. The rest is in value or special situations. 

&gt; By the end of Q1 this ratio flipped, with the portfolio more tilted to Tactical value than ever. The change was one part deliberate (turning over more stones in value stock land and trimming some expensive positions), one part opportunistic (jumping at timely situations I’d been monitoring).

Both by design and market fluctuations, the size of the core portfolio declined in terms of weighting.

&gt;I believe the regime change towards value is likely to last for years, supported by higher baseline inflation and a historical tendency for growth-to-value rotations (and vice versa) to last for 3-5+ years at a clip.

If you were to apply even 2x leverage on to SP500, the max drawdown would wipe out your investment (-100%). For the AWP, 2x leverage would result in -30%.

&amp;#x200B;

Example B: [AWP with leverage applied](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/aw-2x-aw-3x-hedgefundie-55-45.png)

If you look at Portfolio 1 in Example B, which is AWP 2x, and compare it to the performance of the SP500, how does it look now? The CAGR beats the SP500 with half of the max drawdown and the same stdev.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly - looking at it visually, you can see for yourself the smoothness of the trend in comparison to the SP500. SP500 it goes up, it goes down, but at the end of the day averages 10.50%. The AWP in comparison trends on a fairly smooth basis which allows the opportunity of additional leverage. The market could crash 10% tomorrow, but the AWP might only fall a few %."

Investors could have had lower beta and higher returns in bonds."
2022-05-06 10:07:11,"Yes - indirectly. 

When you’re managing that size of assets, you have a liquidity and slippage problem. When I put 5% of my portfolio in a position, no one blinks an eye. When bridgewater puts 2.5% of their fund into a position, it moves the entire underlying market. So, there’s an exponential difficulty in entering and exiting positions as your assets scale. SEC puts special exceptions in place for Buffett for that exact reason because any time Berkshire files anything, an army of retail investors crowd his trade.

Other important factor is volatility. Most people forget about when dealing with “hedge” funds. The Bridgewater might only pace the SP500 average, but they do it with a fraction of the volatility. SP500 volatility might be acceptable when you’re dealing with unlevered positions, but when your clients are levered up 10x, a negative year could wipe out your clients assets when they get margin called on a -5% x 10:1 leverage year."

2022-05-05 10:01:52,"I believe at a more macro level this is a signal of the net-new renewable shift (in installed capacity) from wind deployments to solar deployments. 

Wind has largely captured its cost declines from making their turbines larger (with more stable wind and higher capacity factors). 

Solar on the other hand, for panels and inverters (semi conductors) have been able to take advantage of more ‘Moore’s Law’ type effects to decrease costs. It has also been around the end of the last decade where wind and solar costs met, with different returns based on geography and market. 

Ensuring smooth permitting, renewable energy targets, carbon pricing and renewable incentives continue should provide enough incentive to scale for the wind industry to adjust. Seems though that quite a bit of pain is set for the short term.

Efficiency and cost declines on the long term curve should still be expected, but effects on material costs / commodity inputs are likely to be a damper for the foreseeable future. 

Wind companies share prices have been pretty beat down, this could represent a good entry point when having a 1-2 decade long view, IMO. But more acutely, I expect a breakout in the Solar&lt;-&gt;Energy Storage mode for much of the growth and additions globally for the remainder of 2030."

2022-05-05 03:49:40,"Some publicly traded companies that were once family owned companies who went public but are still dominated on the board by those people and have a sweet spot with a moat from holding strong government contracts can end up being a piggy bank for the board via an endless number of methods, usually through the marketing budget or similar methods. Peet Ltd is one example like this. The SP almost never moves the needle. 

Your friend needs to have an external audit done on the company by some corporate outfit. Can be expensive. He'll probably find the execs will fight this tooth and nail for obvious reasons. Also, they might have provisions to collapse the company hurriedly in just such a case. Arranging for an existing, outstanding loan to breach covenants and pull the company into immediate default and liquidation as a suicide pill is one method so tread carefully. Better for them to collapse the bag than go to jail."
2022-05-05 03:18:54,"Yep I know exactly which PE firm you're talking about. 

I think your friend's most realistic option is to hire an investment bank himself to advise on his stake disposal, remember selling the company isn't the only option, he could try to find a stratgic who would be interested in his 25% stake and sell that off instead.  This would enable him to monetise his stake and just ignore the board and the CEO. He won't get the best price for it and certainly no premium, but it lets him cash out. 

If your friend is hellbent on selling the company though, he needs to 100% make sure management is on-board. That management may not stay after the takeover, but they're crucial in the DD. Depending how long ago this sale process was, he might be able to persuade the management to reach back out to the original bankers who ran the sale process but ask for it to be a bilateral (no auction, just talk to 1 PE firm)."

2021-02-03 01:24:57,"I trade them long term. I don't believe in short term trading as an effective strategy, levered or not, so I buy them and hold. 

I think they can be powerful tools and have the potential to massively outperform the market over a long period, but should be diluted with regular index ETFs to an appropriate level of leverage (I go no higher than 1.5x). Your all in cost of borrowing including MER and the cost of the Swaps used to construct the ETF (based on short term LIBOR rates plus a spread), could potentially be lower than a margin account. 

My optimism aside, I do believe that levered ETFs are highly inappropriate for inexperienced or undisciplined investors and I wouldn't recommend anyone use them unless they really understand what they are buying. I would never purchase a levered ETF tracking any index besides a major equity market index (S&amp;P) or investment grade debt.

2021-02-03 01:03:47,"NUGT was actually 3x before and during the covid crash. You're absolutely correct that leveraged ETFs are short volatility. They are exponentially sensitive to an index beta. However this is why comparing TQQQ with NUGT is like comparing apples to oranges, because GDX has a completely different beta profile than QQQ and completely different potential returns over time. GDX follows commodities which mostly don't steadily go up over time. The risk associated with TQQQ and NUGT is completely different, and you shouldn't pile all the leveraged ETFs together just because they have the name on their ETFs. Agreed that you should not hold NUGT for long periods though."
2021-02-03 00:59:47,"Wasn't Bill Miller the guy saying that ""Bitcoin becomes less risky the higher it goes""? To me, that just sounds crazy. 

I'll admit, I'm not tech-savvy enough to fully understand cryptocurrencies. The most common bull case I've heard from non-speculators is that bitcoin will be a dollar replacement. I don't really see how that's possible with how volatile it is and how many people are solely buying/transacting in it (i.e. NFL guy asking to be paid in bitcoin) because it's been doing well recently. For example, if I walk into a store with $10, I can reasonably expect that I'll be able to purchase $7 of organic chicken, and $3 of quinoa/broccoli by the time I walk to the checkout counter without a massive change in the value of the dollar. Can the same really be said about bitcoin?

2021-02-03 00:44:54,"Because the decay everyone is referring to is not the whole story. It's not a decay but a mistracking due to daily compounding and volatility. Leveraged ETFs can also compound upward if there are multiple up days, resulting in more than 2 or 3 times the index. Decay is only apparent when an index crashes, moves sideways, or if volatility is extremely high. However, since over time stocks usually move up, there will also be upward compounding/mistracking, which is why you see over a long period, TQQQ and UPRO has actually returned more than 3 times QQQ and SPY."
2021-02-03 00:44:14,"Not to be a bit of debbie downier, but the last 11 years since '08 the markets have rallied and volatility has decreased, this is a fantastic environment for leveraged etfs. Remember daily leveraged etfs leave you SHORT volatility. 

Go look at NUGT, which is a 2x levered ETF. Go look at the price in google back in 2011, you'll see that the split adjusted price is something insane like $80,000. The price today is 60. 

Now look at GLD. GLD is basically unchanged from 2011. Meanwhile NUGT has lost more than 99% of it's value. You can do this for many leveraged ETFS, but they they decay because of volatility. 

Note that the decay can kind of sort work in your favor as well, if the market rallies with low vol you might end up doing better than 2x, I think this might have been the case with TQQQ. 

Not a recommendation one way or another, but I just think it's important to understand the risks, the vol decay is kind of obscure and might be something not everyone is aware of."

I listened to this because it's a different perspective from my style of investing and it's someone I've actually heard of. 

The only real insight that I got from it was her point about how things get exponentially cheaper over time to produce. I do think she has some good points about how, for example, genome sequencing will get cheaper and cheaper, and therefore it's important for me as an investor to not just think about economies of scale/margins in a linear fashion. 

Outside of that, I think the majority of the posts captured my sentiments exactly. I don't really understand how Wright's Law can justify Tesla's crazy valuation, for example, which just so happens to be one of her largest holdings. She also never touched upon competition or how she's picking these ""innovators""/what separates them from one another. 

I might buy some $ARKG, because I am a believer in genomics being the ""semiconductor"" of this century and I'd rather have an active manager pick for me versus rolling the dice on individual names that might go bust, but I'm frankly not that impressed with her holdings in the other ETFs.

2021-02-03 00:35:59,"“The most popular leveraged ETFs will have an expense ratio of approximately 0.95%, which is considerably higher than the approximate average expense ratio of 0.46% for all ETFs across the board. This high expense ratio is basically a management fee, and it will eat into your profits and help exacerbate your losses.”

2021-02-03 00:24:30,"They differ. I like Invesco, I shares, and pro shares. Direxion daily has SOXL, but in general I find them to be poorly managed so I don’t like them. For example, their leverage SPY etf underperform sole of the other company’s. It should be easy to just copy whatever it is those companies are doing for something as simple and liquid as spy."
2021-02-03 00:24:19,"Your grammar is worse than a child. You're just showing me, time and time again, that you're poor. LOL"
2021-02-03 00:23:51,"Helps that its been a 10 year bull run. If markets are flat, you end up losing more than if you held a non-leveraged ETF."
2021-02-03 00:22:14,"If your referring to SPXL, sure, probably one of the safer leveraged etfs around. The issue here is the expense ratio, which varies around 1%, lack of income compared to SPY ( ~.2 vs 1.2), and again the beta decay. SPXL dropped to $19 in March, levels not seen since 2015 in this ETF. This is a good example of the beta decay effect. A simpler example: (1+.25) × (1-.2) = 1  (1+.75) x (1-.6) = .7 [3x leveraged simple return is -30%, non leveraged simple return is 0]. 
 Had the market not rebounded so sharply, with very few down moves since then, you would have been set back many years on this position. So thats the catch. If the market continues strong moves up, with fewer smaller moves down, SPXL will be far superior in terms of simple return. If the market trades sideways or has a down year, you will be amplifying your return loss significantly. I won't say if its a good or bad investment, because I cannot predict the market, but this is my best at explaining. Hope this helps."
2021-02-03 00:18:13,"Yeah definitely agree with you. Are all 3X etf’s have the same fee rates, can’t find any on the ones I’ve looked at. Would love to learn how much potential profit is eaten by the fees and borrowed interest."
2021-02-03 00:14:25,"Also note that lots of these are actually debt obligations of the issuing bank, so they are purely synthetic. While they do rebalance the reference, they do not necessarily have to roll over positions.

I do, however, take issue with the idea of options being a drop-in replacement for leveraged ETFs since many of the leveraged ETFs either represent some bucket or index and it would be hard/expensive to build a basket of options to accomplish the same thing in the directly underlying securities."
2021-02-03 00:11:17,"People think they understand leverage decay and like to throw it around as a buzzword but haven’t actually done math. It’s been a 12 bagger the last 5 years including a -30% year in 2018 when qqq dropped by 3%. Yes, due to the nature of daily resetting leverage, there is some decay and compounding leads to dislocation (no long 3x), but that compounding dislocation works in your favor too."
2021-02-03 00:07:49,"Sort of, but also not?

Institutional investors likely use similar strategies, but with the luxury of being able to build bespoke products.

So, yes they are geared toward retail investors, yes there are hefty fees, but no their sole purpose is not to bleed money from retail investors."
2021-02-03 00:04:55,Yeah that’s what I mean.
2021-02-03 00:03:53,The expense ratios are small compared to the effects of volatility on a daily levered product.
2021-02-03 00:03:46,"Like if crazy speculation was causing a short squeeze and you think the market might react negatively the next few days.

Not sure how volmplays into that, but maybe inverse levered would have been better than buying a put?

Got the direction right, but it was already priced in through vol expansion."
2021-02-03 00:02:13,Yeah I’m confused by this. If an ETF is experiencing consistent growth then holding lo term is fine right?
2021-02-03 00:01:07,What do u mean a 72 or 12 bagger u mean 12 or 72 x returns right i was looking at those etfs last night and saw similar returns it looked wild
2021-02-02 23:59:32,Ya i was looking at those etfs last night one went up like 7900% in that time frame so i think there might be something to this strategy

2021-02-02 23:54:02,"The reason for their daily use is because of the expense ratios. They are higher and will eventually eat up your investment long term. Not always do these ETFs perform as mentioned (2x, 3x) when held longer than you’re supposed to."
2021-02-02 23:50:57,Anything that is heat-not-burn is essentially guaranteed to be safer; it’s common sense. You’re not allowed to market it as such given the ridiculously onerous (and multi-year) studies the FDA requires to make such a claim. FDA is costing a lot of lives imho.

Depends on what you need to know."
2021-02-02 23:42:46,"Use leveraged ETFs for the pros of leverage, without increasing risk (con of leverage). That means if you have a non-consensus view, you can exploit the leveraged ETF by owning a smaller position (to manage your downside) for the same upside exposure as owning the vanilla ETF. If you view is truly non-consensus, your leveraged ETF trade should possess an outsized risk:reward (e.g. &gt; 1:3). Useful if you're trying to offset the risk from another position in your portfolio."

Holding them longer than a week or two starts eroding your principle due to the high costs of constantly rolling over short or long positions and balancing that with inflow and outflow of funds into the ETF

They experience significant decay, from beta slippage, and frequent rebalancing. Leveraged etfs are also complex in nature, often consisting of intricate chains of swaps and other derivatives. This also means that by no means, is any  leveraged etf guaranteed to move by ""x"" times the underlying. Price gaps and decay are also exacerbated by high volatility.

2021-02-02 21:42:45,"As someone who used to smoke a lot of marijuana, the top-of-my-head statistic is that 80% of users are 'heavy users' or something to that regard.


The thing with weed is that the more you smoke, the higher your tolerance is, and the more you need for that same original high.

For instance, if I took one rip of a $10 joint today, I'd be good until tomorrow.. I could probably make that joint last me a week.

But 2 years ago I was smoking about an eighth a day easily (roughly 3-4 joints worth a day). That doesn't include the edibles I'd take for social occasions.

 It's also way more pricey than tobacco (~$10 / joint v. $10 a pack of cigarettes)"
2021-02-02 21:29:38,"I don't know anything about the industry, but Is there another potential problem that they see as well in the much lower volume of consumption for majijuana user's vs tobacco?

Smoking one marijuana joint (as far as I've seen) has a potent enough effect for most user's to be set for a while, although it seems that in tobacco, the phrase 'a pack a day's gets thrown around a lot.

Perhaps this could be fixed with genetic engineering, but may be a deterrent to a products profitability as well?"
2021-02-02 21:28:35,"That's one person in a sea of people that doesn't mean anything. There's been a huge influx but honestly most will probably invest poorly, lose money and leave quickly.

Cronos was down to $25 million because regulations. Who understands regulations better than anyone? So they almost buy a weed company for $1.8 (45% of one, and they paid premium for it).

2021-02-02 21:00:42,"In anyone’s opinion, does a company like XXII have a chance against the big three titans? 

If I understand correctly, they’ve manufactured a “low nic” cigarette and have the patent for regulating nicotine within a tobacco plant. They also have several cannabis patents which could play out well. 

Apparently their goal, according to their website, is to have the FDA push the “low nic” cigarette as a way to quit smoking. Ideally, for them, it looks like they would be able to sell / “license” the patent out to other companies as the FDA will require all combustible nicotine consumption to be reduced. With the talk of the Dems taking a more... aggressive approach, in regulations, would it make sense for 22nd century group to become a big player? 

I spent a decent amount of time looking into the company and it all seemed solid. I’m just skeptical due to the amount of time it’s taken for the FDA to approve or deny XXII’s creation and without them already having a substantial foothold, I’m unsure about them."

The most common track of getting in is undergrad at a ""target"" school --&gt; IBD --&gt; PE or HF --&gt; stay and continue in PE/HF or get an MBA --&gt; then get back into PE/HF. Given the number of PE/HF spots there are versus the number of target school students with finance experience, (there are plenty of the latter), it is difficult to get in without that. I've unfortunately seen a decent amount of delusional people who hope for the best by getting into an MBA and trying to break into PE/HF after, yet possess little intellectual skill or humility, and fall flat on their faces.  It is very off-putting to meet these people who are simply obsessed with making a ton of money. No. People need a passion for the work and preferably, a ton of discipline/self-control.

That being said, diversity often improves decision making, so a smart PE/HF place is hopefully aware enough to appreciate unusual, useful skillsets to add to their teams. You need to have superior social, communication, and analytical skills to stand out enough. "

2016-09-02 08:02:39,"Very interesting, thanks for the post. Reminds me of this excerpt from Seth Klarman's Margin of Safety, which I think may apply to today's markets:

&gt; 	Some investors, fixated on current return, reach for yield not with a new Wall Street product, but a very old one: common stocks. Finding bond yields unacceptably low, they pour money into stocks at the worst imaginable times. These investors fail to consider that bond market yields are public information, well known to stock investors who incorporate the current level of interest rates into share prices. When bond yields are low, share prices are likely to be high. **Yield-seeking investors who rush into stocks when yields are low not only fail to achieve a free lunch, they also tend to buy in at or near a market top.**

So many of the material things you enjoy are a result of corporate or corporate-like activities. Do you like driving? The convenience of keeping fresh food in your refrigerator? Etc.

The government...apparently all it has going for it these days, is that some people wrote a somewhat decent Constitution a couple hundred years ago? But now what? What a mess. "

2016-09-01 11:52:29,"I will definitely plan to let you know what I think of what you said. This is a ton of information, however, so it's going to take me some time to digest it so I can respond thoughtfully. :)"
2016-09-01 11:37:11,"likewise, i just pieced all these things together myself, I have no formal training in economics nor do I want any, most of what's taught in universities these days is theory developed in the past 30 years, theories assuming the monetary system we have now is the system we'll have forever, when a simple study of history proves that that has *never* been the case. money-at-interest is an untenable practice in the long run, basically central banks just want to create wealth from nothing; the economy is a self-regulating system, central bank interference juices it and does produce some kind of stimulus, but it's the same thing as steroids, eventually the system just can't sustain the forced input and has to correct to a real concensus of value. Look at a 30 year chart of the SP500 to see it in effect.

I agree with just about everything you said, and you're spot on about cash being a better wealth hedge than bitcoin/gold but be careful; it is possible to go from deflation to inflation very quickly. Right now we're in mild deflation (would be severe deflation without QE and other money-printing practices), and we'll continue to be in deflation until central banks make a drastic change in their policies (ultimately resulting in directly financing the debt). There are just too many debts to repay and not enough growth/income to repay it, people are saving money to pay down debts and aren't investing/spending it. This is problematic because it's like a negative feedback loop: more uncertainty in future growth -&gt; more cash hoarding -&gt; deflation -&gt; more uncertainty about future growth, etc. The theory here is that central banks can slash interest rates, make money cheaper/easier to borrow, people spend it on stuff and things get moving again. This is a fundamental core of modern economic theory, and I think the past 8 years of zero-bound rates kind of disproves its validity.

We need yield because money has an interest rate attached to it, if money is lent into the economy at %0.5 and there's only %0.2 of yield, that's an unsustainable system bound to collapse. So... to get a bit conspiratorial I think this system was ultimately designed to fail. It's made a lot of its directors rich, at the expense of the public. It's also helped strongarm countries into joining a globalist system/taking loans from the IMF in order to stay alive in what is an inherently caustic, debt-mandatory financial system. But I digress.

Money shouldn't have a yield, it simply needs to maintain a supply equal to the demand for it, thus you have price stability. In a debtless monetary system deflation is no worse than inflation; however in a debt-based monetary system inflation is necessary, since debts are nominal and inflation destroys the real value of currency, making debts easier to repay (although the creditors still would be losing purchasing power, granted the main creditor are central banks who made this money from nothing so it's usually contained), whereas deflation ruins ability to repay debts and is a Sword of Damocles for governments.

It's all very confusing, and purposefully so, to keep people from wising up to the real objective of central banks; to unify the world under a global financial system they control (embodied by the IMF and their Special Drawing Rights) by holding nation's economies hostage via loaning their currencies to them, at interest. Take that into perspective and a lot of what seems to be bullshit, becomes undoubtedly bullshit. But even if you're totally unbiased in contemplation of this system, you'll still reach the conclusion that it is plainly untenable, so to call it 'conspiracy theory' is rather short-sighted. Economics is %95 common sense.

Anyway, if you want a more alternative (and i'd argue real) view of the economy this guy makes lots of sense. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xDSgOMifo8

lemme know what else you think, but let me close in saying I think the financial system we have is designed to fail and trying to make sense of it, or rather to justify it, is a fools errand."

2016-09-01 10:27:23,"I don't think it's about whether people use physical cash and whether more or less physical cash as a % of money supply affects interest rates. 

I THINK the author is making a case for removing it as an alternative, so that people would be FORCED to only keep their savings within electronic accounts or assets. In an electronic cash account, you don't have much of a say over how the value of that cash changes. It has historically gone up due to positive interest rates (e.g. your bank lends it to the US government at like 2% and gives you like 1% of it). People generally and vaguely understand that we have to put some into assets such as stocks to earn a return above inflation (because even with the interest that's earned on cash in a savings account, it's losing value over time due to inflation). 

If interest rates were to go negative, some people would consider changing their cash into physical cash because physical cash can't legally be taken away, so it'll be worth more than the cash that's left in negatively yielding accounts. This is even better than switching over the gold/bitcoin because the value of physical cash wouldn't fluctuate due to the market trends.

I think?? Is this right? My brain is getting blown out by trying to understand this stuff. Also I don't even think a ""free market"" has anything to do with this. Cash's value has been getting manipulated due to central bank activity; allowing for this to happen would strengthen the tools for manipulation. Right?

To your other points, why exactly do we need growth or yield? I think fears about deflationary spirals are overblown and not enough attention is being paid to how structurally inefficient our economy has become due to poorly written government regulations and systems rife with loopholes. Helicopter money has not really worked in other countries. I have a theory that inflation/growth has been so tepid because the structure of the economy discourages productivity. The central bank activities have been making it worse because it's making already wealthy people even richer; though I understand the need to stabilize the stock market so that employers don't mass fire people and stuff like that.

I can detail this more if you're interested, but my understanding is definitely not perfect, so please don't hold me to unreasonably high standards."

given how we've had pathetic growth w/ 8 years of the lowest interest rates set ever, yeah, hard assets like Bitcoin and gold are very attractive places to shelter wealth. we NEED growth/yeild of some kind else all your retirees end up homeless and you get serious social instability. central banks will have to unleash zero-coupon, helicopter money and directly monetize the debt, which will be highly inflationary and will juice the economy back into activity. my guess is they'll unleash it if/when the spx tanks to 1500 or so.

sadly enough money without interest is how money was always meant to be. that's an entire other discussion about the insidious nature of central banking "

2016-08-31 10:58:55,"I am former lawyer turned investor and money manager, so I can say that the transition is possible. As I talk to other investors, I have been surprised to meet a number of others that have law degrees.  And, as others have noted, Charlie Munger started as a lawyer.  That said, it is a challenging transition in the best of circumstances.

One thing to think about is how prepared you are to make the transition.  For me, I had a undergrad finance / economics degree, and my legal career was big law, m&amp;a, and securities work, and then I spent several years as a senior exec at a public company.  So, before thinking about making the career change, I already had extensive experience in financial analysis and in understanding financial statements.  If you understand some of the basics of finance / accounting, that is one thing.  If you are really starting from scratch, your learnings curve will be much steeper and longer.

The second thing to consider is whether you have the passion to be a value investor.  When I describe my day, mainly reading 10-Ks and thinking about business models, most think it is mind-numbingly boring.  But I love it.  And, prior to making the transition, I spent several years managing my own money as a hobby, and both really enjoyed the process and had good success.

Quite frankly I'm not too familiar with it, and it is a very very nascent field, there probably only are a couple of firms and the legality may be questionable. It's a new field I find really interesting conceptually, I just haven't heard too much about the actual practice of it and need to look into it. You'd probably have a great edge being a JD. This could be a potential exit op if you leave the internship at your friend's fund. Good luck! "
2016-08-30 22:26:09,":) Nope, but I regularly mentor students from my undergraduate (went to a ""target"" school) and love to help out when possible. 

Absolutely, they are very aggressive.

But I see them as having the HF version of IBD training. Brutal, aggressive, but gives you a foundation for life. I was one of those types that went into IBD knowing I would likely to try to jump out as soon as possible. IBD crazed kids always talk about ""exit"" opportunities and it was very true for me. I even secured a completely unrelated internship (a startup) in my senior year because I had a contract with my IBD job post college. 

If you leave, you'll have to unlearn some of their work style, yes, because brutal honesty doesn't fly with everyone, but they'll likely force you to be top notch in your researching and debate skills. 

They'll also give you insight into the total universe of possible assets to manage. If I were a student wanting to do hedge funds, I'd be less interested in public US equities (so many do this, what's really the edge anymore) and much more in select emerging market or frontier market assets. Our economy is much more likely to continue globalizing; so being able to observe from a Bridgewater place will likely give you great insight in seeing where pockets of big opportunities could be. That's what I'd do if I were a student in college studying finance or economics today; try to find some amazing HF job that had me traveling the world.

The only places that I think offer more ""exit opportunities"" or ""prestige"" or ""great training"" are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. But we're in the SecurityAnalysis sub, so I doubt that's relevant to you or anyone else here."
2016-08-30 22:12:32,"Haha are you a recruiter? ;)

I've actually had dinner with an analyst from Bridgewater before and have spoken to several others who work there. On one hand I see the appeal of the sort of transparency they go for there, but at the same time it seems a little too aggressive for me.  I also don't like the fact that I wouldn't be working on independent company analysis. From what I've gathered, the investment associate role at Bridgewater is more of a research support role that doesn't really see the effect of the work on the portfolio/have any say on the investment decision/how the work is used. 

I could be mistaken though. Big brand name thats for sure. "
2016-08-30 21:35:07,"@Redcards, have you thought about applying to Bridgewater? I'd recommend them the most as the best place to start a hedge fund career. Perhaps you prefer individual public equity value investing, but learning their strategies as well as undergoing their somewhat brutal workstyle will amp your game up considerably--and if you don't like it, you'll be able to go nearly anywhere after. They're also one of the few places that really don't mind taking people right after college (versus many HFs often cherry pick from IBD, etc.)."

2017-06-02 12:56:45,"I agree completely!

Some of the most astute insights I've heard or read, whether it be a from Munger, Lynch, et al., were very succinct at speaking to the core drivers of value within the business. Often, I've found these observations were lite on financial figures and more centered on underlying philosophies and perspectives (that were, of course, backed by financial concerns). 

[Obvious Adams](https://www.amazon.com/Obvious-Adams-Story-Successful-Businessman/dp/0990790916) is a great book that hits me right in the feels when it comes to this ability. Serves as a light refresher from time to time at just how intractable so-called common sense can be. Easy to get lost in the weeds, especially with something so outwardly focused on ""numbers"" as mainstream finance.

Chances are for an entry level position you won't need to do a full blown DCF and depending on the the company they may just tweak the sell side model assumptions rather that create their own from scratch. Make sure you get the comparable valuation spot on, assessment of the financials (on all the 3 main statements) and key drivers nailed and you'll stand a very good chance. 

"
2017-06-02 09:14:46,"1.When is your presentation due? Vianet are due to present results within the next few days. This may affect your thesis.  

2. Have you got access to broker research?

3. Where are you interviewing? This will give me an idea on what to advise based on their process, manager's background etc. 

I'd happily give you a hand with this in a week or so if needed. 

Note- im just about to be promoted to AIM portfolio manager at the boutique investment manager I'm with, so I know a thing or two about this, even though I've never covered Vianet. Don't have time to help advise until next week though as I'm busy with CFA level 3 at the moment. 

"
2017-06-02 09:05:14,"Here is how I used to do it. You can tweak it as you see fit.
Structure:
 
- The idea: I normally use the first slide to give a quick snapshot like name, sector, price, Diluted shares O/S, Market cap and dividend (if any)

- Brief overview of the sector and the landscape. If you will talk about a global opportunity for the company, just touch it there. But again, keep it brief.

- Segments the company operates in - headcount, geography, assets (don't got into revenue yet)

- Why is Vianet worth your attention? - This used to be my standard headline because it made me think as i created the slide as well. I would highlight not more than 4 points - one about the quality of cash flow, one about the assets, one for industry and one for management and their capital allocation ability. Write less and explain more. That will give the impression that you have earned your spot.
- Why is it so cheap? - lack of analysts coverage / liquidity / size / recent troubles etc..
- Brief history of the company. remember the chronology - you may find it a bit weird to have history so late in the presentation but it is like taking your listeners on a journey. start with a question and take them to the answer.
- Quality - if it is a value stock - focus on assets and replacement value. if it is a growth play - focus on their competitive advantage
 - Segments - now go back to the segments and list why you think any one of these or all of these have potential.Charts. regardless of how smart people are, as humans we retain pictographic info better. use charts for revenue, margins, FCF whatever.
- Resilience - if you find anything that shows how resilient the business has been, it is an advantage.
- Management - Explain why you think they are better than the others and the best ones to do the job. use their background to help you but if they have bought back stock when it was cheap or have quoted about a disciplined buyback, i would use it.
 - on the same note, shrewd acquisitions also show why the management is good.
- Balance Sheet : Can't stress its importance enough. 
- Valuation: Regardless of whether you use a multiple based valuation or DCF, be very clear on your assumptions. And to be safe always go with a range, if you think they can do 14% margin, have an estimate for 16%(bull case) and 12% (bear case). 
- Your valuation is only as good as your assumptions. Be reasonable and practical. 
- For a computer grad, if you explain all this and say that you can and will learn valuation, i don't know why they won't give you a shot. 

If you have specific questions on valuation, let me know. 

P.S. I am a computer grad that went into investing. small world :)"

Tbh, i didnt realizs the baby boomer/generation x was a global problem in developed worlds. I thought it was a u.s thing so thats actually interesting. 

The baby boomers experienced imo one of the greatest economic booms in history, mainly going into 90s to 2000s was just great prosperity. Ive been telling everyone this will be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. If people are getting their inheritance early then i agree with the article its propping up levels and we will further create a divide from haves and have nots. The extant im not sure. The article states 25-30%. I have a cousin and a sister who are high payed, the cousin waited during the recent crash to buy a home b/c he thought ir would crash when i told him interest rates were so low it would further push prices up...he didnt listen and now he is kicking himself. Sister instead bought a bunch of rental property which i said was a good idea, but i dont think she will be buying a personal home anytime soon. They are generation x, both still live at home in their mid 30s. Kinda shitty all around. Its a weird weird dilemma because they are rich as fuck 6 figure solo earners, yet that cant buy them a personal home? 

W.t.f. 

Im calling a top though. All around. Im just hearing too many things peter lynch talked about to realize we are in financial frenzy again.

2017-06-01 22:21:44,Can you explain this. Normally lower earnings growth would make for a lower valuation e.g. on a discounted cash flow basis.

I mean, if they encourage higher prices and take an unknown chunk out of things, that would certainly increase these selective price hikes by drug companies, because both parties are incentivized to promote higher cost drugs."
2017-06-01 16:47:51,"It's a cycle:
Developer margins are not as high as you may imagine as the land values have skyrocketed too.  So to buy a plot and build on it costs a shit ton more than it used to, hence the higher retail prices. 

Banks are happily lending at low rates which is fueling more projects and riskier builds (by developers).


As I mentioned in my original post, the common denominator is the banks lending (to businesses and not just individuals buying a house) which is tired to the interest rates.  If (and that's a big if) it moves significantly, it will be a bloodbath.

2017-06-01 10:52:49,"Vancouver is a different ballgame from Toronto and there was a huge influx of Chinese wealth propping up the market beginning with the handover of Hong Kong back to China.  Chinese also believe that new is worth more than used and with that mentality, they would rather a condo sit empty than rent it out and deal with the headache. Toronto has vacancy rates of less than 1%, believe me, we have more renters than we have units.  Recently both Toronto and Vancouver have clamped down on vacant properties (via fine) and foreign buyers fees. A recent ad for Toronto condo sales in a Hong kong news paper touted the developer paying the 15% foreign buyers fee as an incentive... That should tell you what you need to know about the demand strength. 


I'd love to indulge in your climate change theory but I'll summarize my counterpoints:

1. If the world is getting warmer, people would be fleeing hotter climate places. It's quite the opposite in fact, Australia's RE market is a prime example. 

2. I believe Canada was undervalued for a long time. We don't have the media-frenzied divide like the US, racial and radical terrorism issues etc. Of course these do exist, but are generally accepted as par for the course by foreigners. The country is also geographically gifted and has a relatively small population to contend with (less than 40M).  I. E. Like new Zealand, people want to live here, especially BC, Ontario.

3. The banking system was historically conservative which helped us stay afloat during the world collapse. That said, with the lowering of interest rates and spurred borrowing, this may not be the case anymore. 



As an aside, climate change has been around for a long time, and whilst I agree with the importance of combating it, why do we all of a sudden feel like we are falling off a cliff? What happened to these activists 20 years ago...  Don't you think it's a little odd that we've gone 0 to 100 on the topic in a matter of a decade? Reminds me a bit of Ralph Nader's run in the 2000 US elections and how the state of California and celebrities touted him as the new face of America.

The author also completely misunderstands Buffett's comments on coke and gilette.

2017-06-01 06:00:40,"China’s most indebted property developer has given its bearish investors a strong slap in the face.

It’s been record after record for China Evergrande Group, with its shares doubling in value in the past month, and tripling year-to-date.

The surge can be attributed to multiple factors, but chairman Hui Ka-yan’s ambition to defeat short-sellers, tapping his Hong Kong tycoon friends to pave the way for its planned listing on the mainland, is undoubtedly the key driver behind the dramatic rises.
On Monday, the developer’s shares shot up an astonishing 23 per cent, even after rallying the previous eight consecutive trading days.

By the close of play on May 29, its market value had reached almost HK$200 billion (US$25.66 billion), trading at a record 36 times historical earnings to become the most expensive property stock on the Hong Kong market.

“Hui and some of his friends are just trying to fry up the share price, and push for a better valuation before an IPO,” said Philip Tse, property analyst at Bocom International.

n April, Evergrande splashed out HK$6.3 billion on 5.3 per cent of its shares, a move which has since sent its price up 50 per cent in under a month.

The chairman now controls 77.79 per cent of the company shares, and Evergrande’s public float has dropped to 22.21 per cent, right on its minimum limit.

“Hui has 300 billion yuan cash on hand, [although he can’t repurchase more shares], he can find other ways to boost Evergrande’s price, ” said Toni Ho, a property analyst at RHB-OSK Securities.

Analysts believe the remaining shares are partly controlled by some of Hui’s closest Hong Kong-based circle of wealthy friends, and the real public float could be far less than the number on the book, which means when short sellers are forced to liquidate their positions, stock prices could see a significant rise in a short term, because of a lack of liquidity.

Most notably, Chinese Estates, a company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau Luen-hung’s wife Chan Hoi-wan, has been actively trading in Evergrande since mid-May, through its Fair Eagle Securities.

Lau, the Hong Kong billionaire is well-known for his close relationship with Hui and also a debtor of Evergrande.
On May 26 alone, it bought another 26 million shares, building its stake in Evergrande to 0.22 per cent from 0.02 per cent, according to the disclosure from the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Despite its standing now as China’s largest homebuilder, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Evergrande, however.

Its shares have long been traded at as low as 3 to 5 times P/E ratio in Hong Kong after debuting in 2009 as investors worried over its heavy debt burden, making it a prime target for short sellers.
Its total borrowings surged 80 per cent by the end of 2016 on year to 535 billion yuan.

The real turning point came in March after Hui vowed to start deleveraging, and he has since repaid half of its outstanding high-interest perpetual bonds.

A number of top investment banks, including Morgan Stanley and Citi, subsequently raised their target price for the stock this month.
A fortnight ago, S&amp;P surprised many by upgraded its long-term corporate credit rating on Evergrande to B from B-, citing its improved liquidity and strong sales.

“Evergrande’s balance sheet is improving, as well as its profit forecast,” said Liu Feifan, a property analyst at Guotai Junan International.


Its share price, say analysts, has also been driven up by investors speculating on the price gap between Evergrande’s Hong Kong shares and the expected valuation of its Shenzhen listing, and opinion is still divided on the company’s accurate current valuation.
“Definitely like the Goldin or Hanergy bubble, its valuation is not sustainable,” Tse said.

A 30 billion yuan first-round of pre-IPO financing in January gave Evergrande’s property assets a market value of nearly 230 billion yuan – double its valuation in Hong Kong at the time.

My conspiracy theory is that it isnt just a place to funnel money, but a lot of the chinese money comes from a knowledge of what pollution can do, thus climate change. As temperatures increase northward once cold places will be warmer, more habitable and optimal for human life where as other places suffer. There was a graph that showed this for north america and temperature shifts showing the bottomish part of canada increasing in average historical temp as well as parts like michigan in the u.s.

You can use DCF, but it will almost never be the only way you will value a stock. To grow in confidence and to become a better investor, you need to learn why and how we do a good DCF based on sound logic. It may sound tedious but when the stock corrects significantly, your understanding of FCF based valuation will help you have a better conviction than just slapping a multiple. All the best!"

2017-06-01 00:33:01,"So my critiques...

While the format and presentation are great, your short argument fails the really basic logic test and also any diligence:

- You base your valuation on a TAM and then an assumed market penetration number, getting your base case to 9.2M members... PLNT already has 10M members and growing?
- You use a royalty rate to determiner franchise EBITDA.  This fails to account for ARPU changes due to increased Blackcard penetration and also the increase in franchisee royalty rates + their potential Blackcard price increase?
- Have you spoken to any franchisees?  They will tell you that they love the concept / business and have no issues funding the replacement capex requirements.  Franchisees are always reluctant to spend money but why ruin a 30-40% ROIC unit economic business by being cheap?  There's very little risk to their replacement capex decreasing, especially as their total store footprint grows 
- Why is your corporate owned stores EBITDA lower?  These stores are comping MSD?
- Why do you use $34M for your corporate expense?  It's never been higher than $30M?
- Your unit economics analysis is wrong.  You're using a 7% interest rate ($114 / $1600)?  ROIC would be infinite in this case because it's entirely debt funded?
- Your argument is somewhat predicated on the idea that PLNT cannot penetrate new geographies.  Again, have you spoken to franchisees?  They will tell you that their unit economics in the new stores in the west are similar to better than what they've seeing historically in the east?
- Could it be possible that PLNT, since it targets a casual, non-hardcore gymgoer, could possibly grow the TAM?
- Why are you using 175 new stores opened?  They have been and are going to open 200 net new stores w/ 1K new stores under ADA?
- They provide a replacement vs. new store capex breakout.  Your numbers on page 11 are wrong. 
- Again, franchisees love the PLNT business model.  That's why &gt;90% of new stores are built by existing franchisees and ~20% of franchisees own more than 10 stores.  These do not seem to be owners ""at risk of leaving the business model""
- Umm... you have them busting covenants because your EBITDA is ~$40M below what they already reported in 2016?
- What is this concept of distributions to NCI?  They paid out $270M of dividends last year to shareholders so obviously there's more than enough FCF for distributions?

The numbers looked great, growth was there, I could understand the business, the price was fantastic and I liked and trusted the Chinese CFO.

Unfortunately, the only thing that was wrong was that the Company was a total sham and fraud. One day the website disappeared completely with no news and eventually the SEC pulled their listing. Total loss. Nothing an investor can do except learn and make a mental note never to invest in these types of things in China.

I'm glad I was diversified and this was my one and only small investment in China. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this. They're not very creative in that they appear to have the same patterns. Reverse Merger. Cheesy Names like fruit, agriculture, green, tech, etc.

Maybe I'm over extrapolating from all the E&amp;P pullouts as well as Kinder Morgan but I don't see it regardless of multiples. There's arguably a political risk premium you have to consider im Canada and I think the US companies don't want it.

I might be overly negative since SLB, BH, and HAL have approximately 30 percent of Canadian pumping market share, but I think Step also might be too small for them.

Regarding the cash equity split, I just can't see ARC (the PE fund) taking back equity. They own so much of Step that taking any back would be a significant amount. Maybe once they wind down their position but that won't happen at today's prices. "
2018-10-03 13:02:56,!RemindMe 3 months
2018-10-03 12:50:03,"Cool, thanks for the detailed colour.

As an addition, why are the US big guys avoiding WCSB? The heavy multiple discount would surely make an acquisition immediately accretive, and they presumably have the cash to offer.

Further, would it be a hard cash-only or a majority cash, some equity? Like a 65/35 split"
2018-10-03 12:38:58,"Yeah, I would think any of the majors or we could see additional consolidation within the Canadian industry. I don't expect a transaction for a few reasons though. Any international company is avoiding the WCSB like the plague so I can't see a US company making any acquisitions. I don't see it in th Canadian space because Calfrac doesn't have the debt capacity, Trican consolidated the space last year with equity and I don't expect them to do it again with their equity at current levels. I also wouldn't expect STEP to take an equity deal because I don't think the PE sponsor wants any sort of equity as they'd want a clean exit. 

Basically, I don't see them getting acquired unless it was a cash offer. I don't see that happening because Trican is the only possible party right now. I don't see it happening because I think the offer would have to come at at least 10 dollars a share to be remotely considered (probably higher given where STEP IPOd at). That would mean Trican would have to take on 950m in debt. Given the current investment environment in oil and gas, I can't see it. No one is willing to offer that kind of capital these days. Maybe that changes as sentiment eventually follows oil prices, but we need to see spreads on WCS, Ed light, and Aeco close before any sentiment changes 
"
2018-10-03 12:15:40,So who would be the buyer of a pressure fracking company then? A larger US Corp looking for exposure to wcsb??
2018-10-03 11:12:42,"Yeah, asymmetric opportunities are a bit in the eye of the beholder. In terms of service companies, Western Energy Services is also attractive. It's approaching being an equity stub but it doesn't have any near term debt maturities. I would be in it, but I find Step to be more attractive, but if you want to be in the actual drilling space instead of fracking it's probably the best bet right now.

My other two are GXE and BIR. GXE is a low cost heavy oil producer which gained some light oil exposure recently. I'm more attracted to it because, similar to Peyto, Don Gray is the chairman who is frankly the best operator in the space.

BIR is a low cost natural gas producer with significant liquids exposure which is why it's come off all time lows unlike Peyto and Advantage. Birchcliff also has very strong recycle ratios given current gas prices. Both Peyto and Advantage  are reasonable picks if you are bullish on AECO. I'm indifferent to natural gas prices though I think they'll come up a bit. I see curve moving up (AECO anyway) simply because capex budgets for natural gas budgets have been absolutely slashed and everyone is focusing on liquids which I could see pushing it too far away from gas. Regardless, I'm not overly in it because I'm more interested in stocks where we're already heavily discounted based on current commodity prices. Peyto is on my watch list simply because of the management team. I mostly don't love AECO because the Montney is a ridiculous gas play with economics rivalling the Marcellus in some areas. 

Otherwise, I'd recommend looking at Questor. It's a Canadian microcap darling, but has a large drop (understandably so) as it's mainly services in Colorado which might be essentially banning all drilling in the state (or 90 percent of it).

Petroshale is also very interesting. They are venture listed, but are a very small player in the core of the ND Bakken. They're trading at a very low price compared to cash flow, but it's primarily because they have very little for drilling inventory. They've been slowly picking off small parcels in the Bakken core so it is very much a management execution story. It's a bit reminiscent of early days Aubrey McClendon and Tom Ward when they were picking up land but this is in a very prolific basin and they're focused on economics unlike the early shale guys.

Realistically, if you are heavily bullish on oil prices and see WTI going to 100, offshore US is the place where you'll see the best returns. Margin of safety isn't great because it is a directional bet on oil prices, but it's a very depressed sector. "
2018-10-03 10:56:50,I don't directly cover them but I do a decent of valuation work in the space. I've been focusing more of my own time on it because it's currently the most undervalued sector in the market.

Other than STEP, are there other names you think have asymmetric risk/reward in the sector?

For me looking long term I am thinking names like PEY/AAV may be interesting at these levels. Infrastructure and low full-cycle costs on natural gas could have a lot of torque on a further realised LNG roll-out.

On my main client (American sub of French company, $2B in revenue), I'd guess 50% of our time was documenting planning/strategy or cleaning up documentation of our testing, probably another 30% was internal controls work, with only that last little chunk of 20% as anything I'd call actual testing. I was fortunate enough to avoid any PCAOB audits , but that really just bumps up the documentation time.

Keep in mind everything is being performed at what some statistician buried deep in the firm has determined is a 95% confidence interval, and your overworked, burned out 20 somethings doing all the testing are doing everything they can (that they think will pass an external review) to get any variances under key thresholds so they can just move on and hopefully get home by midnight.  If they find something that doesn't smell right, they get an explanation that seemingly makes sense from a much more experienced accountant from the company, and then do their damnedest to write it up in such a way that the manager of the audit team (low to mid 30's) that everything is fine and dandy. 

The good news is they ARE legitimately looking at the highest risk areas, like intercompany transactions or derivatives.  If a control/account is clearly wrong, it doesn't get a free pass. They're at least the highest performing 20 somethings out of some of the best accounting schools.

2018-10-01 23:35:38,"I think it's a struggle to find someone who is microcap specific in E&amp;P because of the nature of microcaps in the E&amp;P. I'm assuming you're still referring to E&amp;P as opposed the broad market.

Main issue is when they're that size they're usually:

\- Wildcatters which isn't much of a place to hang out as a value investor

\- Along with wildcatters, you might have firms that are stepping out of the core and have worse acreage which is why they're not worth much

\- Horrendous management teams who love destroying value (this is Snarfy's GDP writeup)

\- High cost producers which are simply a play on oil prices

My personal opinion is if you're going to look at microcap oil, you're almost better off picking a terrific operator as opposed to looking at overall value. You can trust them to understand being a low cost producer is the most important thing and not fuck up and make stupid acquisitions/drill when it's uneconomic. E&amp;Ps are full of value destroyers (more specifically poor capital allcoators) who are focused on volume instead of share price.

This is a good example of a small cap writeup (I'm also nearly certain the author is the guy who runs Artko Capital, since the VIC writeups are what Artko has held)

[https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSEHILL\_RESOURCES\_INC\_2022\_WARRANTS/142302](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSEHILL_RESOURCES_INC_2022_WARRANTS/142302)

2018-10-01 23:14:35,"Also an amazing one, but I would struggle to say he's better overall. Biffins is OFS, and more specifically offshore which to an extent is about making the macro calls since those are the high cost producers and more readily affected by commodity prices. His Ensco writeup is looking real tempting considering prices right now and the relative lack of movement in the stock.

Snarfy's hit E&amp;P (including royalty cos), midstream, and OFS, though he is more E&amp;P focused."
2018-10-01 23:06:50,RRC looks good if you think they can get their north Appalachia and terryville off the books for an okay price. They have the best marketing portfolio for the bunch for their NGLs and have the best marcellus acreage out there on a 70/2.50 deck. Key to the story is the path from there to here. SWN sold fayettville for better than expected and the stock tanked because they announced an outspend. RRC needs to get the teir 2 assets off the books and then pivot to FCF return off their NGL assets.

2021-05-04 17:15:06,"What’s the certain level of latency?  I ask that somewhat in jest, because I remember this exact conversation back in 1999/2000.  I just don’t know if you’re ever going to get over accounting’s inherent conservativism and allow, say, CocaCola to put its trademarks on its balance sheet, or Amazon its customer relationships.  Maybe there’s some way to craft some type of adversarial system with dueling appraisals or something like that.  We let ratings agencies do their thing when it comes to credits, after all."
2021-05-04 17:08:20,"Yeah, I think it goes without saying that you need to capitalize more — that’s kind of definitionally the outcome.  The issue is how you get there while minimizing false positives.  A ton of spending can be wasteful and you don’t want that showing up on the LHS of the balance sheet.  It’s that old saw about half of advertising being wasted, but no one knows what half.

I’m not really worried about investors, though.  Clearly they have learned that intangibles are valuable, otherwise the list of the most valuable companies in the world wouldn’t look like it does today.  Part of me actually likes each one having to do their own analysis rather than looking at a balance sheet item, though I think people overplay how important balance sheets were to valuations even “back in the day.”

Your last point about zero marginal cost is 100% right and makes financials even more useless.  If your capital base (tangible or intangible) doesn’t change your marginal cost structure (and thus your marginal cash flow structure), what, exactly, are we looking at it for?

Anyway, this isn’t a new issue.  It was top of mind late in 90s, I remember, but nothing changed.  We’ll see what happens this time."
2021-05-04 17:04:01,"At some point, these *Lex non scripta* will become officially codified as they always have. A codex always comes with a certain level of latency.

2021-05-04 17:01:56,"Capitalize more shit.

Seriously though, only part of the issue is accounting.

The other issue is these businesses are much more often winner take all type businesses so you have to project out long time frames and TAMs and that sort of thing.

Then you also have to value a bunch of optionality that has nothing to do with the current biz but might exist (AWS at AMZN for example).

It's just harder to do this when thinking with a traditional investing mindset. You're moving from (or have been the past 20 years) things having a marginal cost of X and now that marginal cost is $0."

2021-05-04 15:01:23,"This is a helpful, readable summation of the issues in accounting for intangibles. The rub, of course, is what do you do about it. I’ll be interested in what, if anything, is proposed."
2021-05-04 13:30:53,"So my initial reaction to the Q1 earnings was negative. 3 main reasons:

1. Pricing was weak and below expectations. 
2. Utilization was below expectations.
3. They didn't sell all of their production. 

After listening to the call, I have a good understanding of what went wrong and what to expect. My outlook is very positive.

Pricing - This was an oversight on my part. I didn't appreciate how much forward selling they did in Q4. The majority of their sales were booked in Nov/Dec when prices were really bad. I know CF sells 60 days forward and guides that spot prices have about a quarter of delay to transfer into actual results. This will be the case for CVRP as well. From the call they said that they typically sell the majority forward during low seasons (winter, summer) and weight heavier to spot prices during high seasons (spring, fall). Q2 is going to be very good for them. 

Utilization - Overall I'm pretty disappointed on this one. There were questions asked on the Q4 call in Feb about this and they said ""We didn't have any major disruptions at Coffeyville because the plant uses petroleum coke"" and ""At East Dubuque, that was more opportunistic. We had prepurchased gas there at the plant and decided that it would make more sense to take the plant down. And sell the gas into the marketplace rather than operate. So we -- that was more of an economic decision."" Well, it turns out East Dubuque was down for about 12 days because of the storm. Coffeyville unable to operate in January for about 12 days because of a third party supplier that couldn't supply. I felt like the statements were misleading. They had the opportunity to give color on an issue they knew about at the time but chose not to.

Production - They often hold back a portion of their Q1 production to sell into Q2 so this isn't that unusual. In fact, they clarified that the reason for this was because of shipping restrictions that prevented deliveries. They also elaborated that all of the lower priced contracts have been fulfilled and none will be carried forward to Q2. I'd say that's a positive vs. other players (LXU) that still have some lower priced contracts to fulfill in Q2. 

So of the 3 issues, 2 of them were weather related. One was partially weather related but I didn't like the lack of transparency. It's unfortunately typical for CVRP to be very limited in their comments and guidance. This is why my takeaway from the call was actually quite positive. Notwithstanding Q1 issues, they have never been more positive in their remarks on the market and the rest of the year. They also added color on the debt refinance. They plan to reduce total debt by ~$100MM which is roughly what I calculated for the value of 45Qs under the current legislation. So on that basis, I'd say the macro thesis is very much intact for at least another year. 

Items that would make me re-evaluate:

* Macro environment. If farm economics deteriorate, so goes fertilizer. Keep an eye on corn and bean supply/demand, stocks and prices. As management said, it looks like clear sailing to Mid-2022 and probably 2023. But things can always change so I will monitor these.
* Execution of 45Qs and Debt Refi. These two items should be slam dunks. If they bungle this, it erodes my confidence in the management team to execute. 
* Operations - 89% and 87% utilization is piss poor. Hard to say how much was weather related, but if this becomes a habit, it's going to limit their ability to capitalize on these once-a-cycle macro tailwinds. I've reduced my expected utilization for the year and will adjust accordingly after Q2."

So let's use an example. You bought a widget for $10. 

Exp 1) If you sell it once for $15, you made a $5 profit on the $10 investment, so a 50% ROIC and you're done for the year.

Exp 2) Alternatively, you can sell that widget for $11, pocket the $1, buy another widget for $10, and repeat that 5x in a year -&gt; now you have a 50% ROIC because you made $5 from the same $10 investment despite the gross margin being low."

2021-04-29 20:45:32,"I've been a hardcore PC gamer for many many years.  CDPR was the only game studio left I would pre-order from because I had played all of the Witcher series (Witcher 3 still being one of the best RPGs ever created, I'm sure that it came from a book series went a long way in that too) and while Cyberpunk didn't really excite me - a new franchise from CDPR did.

My day 1 release refund included all the good will they had accrued.  Sure, they had already demonstrated their capacity for shady bullshit with Gwent-wants-to-be-Hearthstone along with the 2D-this-is-supposed-to-be-a-game-but-really-it's-an-ad-for-Gwent trash.

GoG is a good idea.  But, it will never be able to supplant Steam, or even all the pitiful rip off stores like Origin.  Why?  Because all of those stores exist - and Steam was first (my account can nearly vote) - based on their original IP being massively famous and popular.

Yes.  CDPR has The Witcher ([despite trying to fuck the creator of the book series out of their legal share under Polish law](https://medium.com/@mccartyj1232/toss-a-coin-to-your-lawyer-why-the-witcher-4-is-probably-happening-3d4c0c8b3eff)).  They previously said they were done with Witcher games, now they're vaguely hinting at a Witcher 4 without Geralt.  I am certain that enthusiasm will be muted thanks to Cyberpunk 2077 and it's the only thing they have.  

I think you greatly underestimate just how much reputation they lost.  I admit I haven't been looking at all, but I haven't seen any media touting a Final Fantasy XIV/No Man's Sky ""we royally fucked up and we'll make it right"" style comeback.

The brand was one thing, the network equipment was someone else and was supposed to show up at the customer's house before we went, the phone company was supposed to have already run the lines, and a fourth company was actually running the network.

All 4 of these had to directly align for a given person to actually have their equipment, have the lines up and working, have the accounts correctly set up and for us to actually put the pieces together and make it work (the fifth subcontracted entity).

Longer story short, it never worked; not once.  At a glance, this kind of reminds me of that and that they want to SPAC their way in makes it - at least for me - not worth further investigation.  Good luck.

Throw in that his brother-in-law is his auditor and his son is also high up in the organization and you have the risk of some nasty allegations, the freezing of accounts, etc. It’s high season on money managers, and Madoff’s head would look pretty good above Elliot Spitzer’s mantle.

I mean, it's kind of logical in a selfish way right? If the post above is somewhat accurate, 20% of the country generates 80% of the GDP. It's in the self interest of the other 80% population to vote to redistribute that GDP to themselves, vs allowing the top 20% to keep all 80% of it. The GOP districts are now poorer on average than Dem districts so these kind of policies should benefit them.

2021-04-28 12:38:01,"“Value” has historically been defined in the context of a company’s book value, dating back to Benjamin Graham’s writings 70+ years ago. Graham’s writings remain foundational and are far more insightful than anything we can produce, but as with all ideas, we feel they must evolve over time. The reality is book value-oriented measures remain relevant for a subset of companies that require capital to operate and grow. In today’s knowledge economy where intellectual property (IP) is critical, we believe accounting book value alone simply fails to offer much guidance in determining what a business is worth.

We assess the fundamentals of a company, including its product strength, market position, profitability, cash generation, balance sheet, and growth opportunities to determine what we believe to be a fair price for those characteristics. For the same reason you might be willing to pay more for an iPhone with tremendous utility vs a flip phone with relatively less, we assign a higher value to a company that boasts above-average marks on the characteristics above. A better business may be more “expensive”, but it could be a better “value”, all things considered.

Those may seem like obvious observations, but the current industry standard of categorizing stocks and portfolios as value or growth seems to cause a choice between characteristics and absolute price.

**2) Ruinous costs**. The U.S. has an excess cost problem in two big industries — [health care](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-08/u-s-needs-to-cure-the-health-care-cost-disease?sref=R8NfLgwS) (plus [child care](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/)), and [construction](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-26/u-s-infrastructure-construction-costs-pose-threat-to-economy?sref=R8NfLgwS). Care work and construction are *exactly* the two biggest sectors that Biden wants to pump money into. Remember how when we poured all that money into California’s high-speed rail program and it [became a giant boondoggle](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-governor-rail/california-to-scale-back-77-billion-high-speed-rail-project-governor-idUSKCN1Q12II) and lots of it got wasted and we didn’t actually get high-speed rail? If that happens with Biden’s new electrical grid etc., we’re in trouble. And if pumping money into long-term care just makes the cost spiral out of control, it will waste labor and add to our overall health cost problem. Either of those outcomes would depress productivity and growth, leaving a smaller pie to be distributed to the nation’s masses. Thus, in order to make sure we actually get bang for our buck, Biden and his team should focus on identifying and mitigating the sources of excess costs in construction and care, rather than just assuming that throwing more money at these things is enough.

There are other dangers, such as higher consumer prices from some of Biden’s less-well-thought-out industrial policies, but I think they’re really second-order compared to these big two. Of the two, I’m much more worried about the second one; **excess costs are the big millstone around the neck of the U.S. economy, a looming problem that so far I haven’t seen either Biden or his Republican opposition talk or think much about.**"

P/E ratios are of course higher than in the past, for a few very simple reasons: 

a) Interest Rates are lower than at almost any point in history.
b) the reliability of cashflow &amp; earnings is greater than ever
c) The make-up of major indexs is such that asset light fast growing companies make up a % of the market cap, therefore pushing the P/E ratio higher than when industrials &amp; energy were the biggest companies. 


And it's not like you can't find ''value'' out there. JPMorgan is the best run bank in the world and has a P/E ratio of 12

Exxon, Caterpillar, Boeing, Merck etc. are all trading at cheap valuations. 


It's not a bubble when the largest companies in the world destroy earnings quarter after quarter and justify ever increasing multiples. 

Amazon literally beat topline estimates by 8 billion, 52 billion of cash flow on a TTM basis. 

Apple &amp; Facebook got an incredible 11% YoY revenue growth during a pandemic &amp; recession.

2. The boom in US stock prices are driven to a large extent by passive flows and the large tech companies.
3. Bonds used to have an inverse correlation to equities, which was crucial to portfolio construction. It reduced volatility and hedged against risk.

But to answer your question, there are decentralised VPNs, e.g. Hola, which use P2P networking to set up a VPN. Currently there are no methods that can allow no-logging of connections between you and another user to occur, or to prevent content you would not want to be accessed from your network being accessed by another user.

There are some proposals, like Brave's VPN0, which claim to overcome these issues but I haven't looked at them in any depth."

2020-11-02 18:58:32,"So I think you misunderstand, I rather mean that the demand for the stock will continue to get bid down, taking it from its PE of around 10 down to closer to 5 or 6. An example of this would be car manufacturers like GM, with its decreasing PE ratio coinciding with growth. Doing a sum of parts analysis on GM, for example, would yield that its car manufacturing business carries about a 4 P/E ratio (after selling off bets like Lyft and Cruise Automation). Regardless of this cash generation, it still has been a pretty lackluster business to be invested in. Tobacco is somewhat similar, as the industry multiples have all been decreasing over the last several years.

Edit: fat fingered it, accidentally commented back using another thread, keeping this here because I deleted my last comment"
2020-11-02 18:58:19,"I’d say we’ll agree to disagree. I see MO with pretty flat earnings, looking for growth with investments into other businesses (my main comparison to GM). 

Moreover, I’m unsure the dividend really is that secure. Considering the global push out of tobacco by wealthy countries, and poorer countries favoritism towards local cheaper brands, I’m not seeing the stability. In the near term, there is value, by markets always price for the future. That and considering Altria nearly doubling its debt in the last two years, the only one seeming to buy MO is the company itself. I respect your viewpoint however. Best of luck!"

2020-11-02 18:43:31,"There’s a huge difference between Altria and an auto manufacturer. GM is in a highly competitive, capital-intensive, cyclical business, and has suspended its dividend. 

Altria has maintained its dividend for over 50 years and is in a business where there’s little new competition and is very stable. If its price fell by 50%, its dividend yield would double and be over 15%. If you then bought at that low price, as long as the dividends continue, you’d make a very high return on your investment. The key point is that you have to be confident that the dividend is sustainable for this to work favourably.

There’s a reason Altria was the best performing stock of all time. It was nearly always significantly undervalued while maintaining its profitability. Those who held on for decades are now rich beyond belief."
2020-11-02 18:37:20,To undermine the ‘spirit of the agreement’ feels less of activism and more of financial tinkering which results in tighter legal convenants in the future.

2020-11-02 18:18:45,"As long as Altria continues to generate plenty of cash, it doesn’t matter what funds do. As a shareholder, you’d be receiving a massive dividend and you’d benefit from any additional buybacks that Altria does."

2020-11-02 17:14:24,"I take back what I said and I agree that it is unlikely that 100% of all Chinese use this app. But come on bro, who else uses wechat outside of China? I am not sure what is the difference between alipay users and mobile payment users, sounds like the same thing. From this https://www.statista.com/statistics/273973/number-of-mobile-internet-users-in-china/ I would assume that 100 percent of these mobile users are using the app. I haven't spent time in third-tier cities in China but I highly doubt that they don't use it. and here https://www.statista.com/statistics/920173/china-share-of-adult-population-with-a-bank-account/ 80 percent of those people have bank accounts. If you have a phone and a bank account, you would have to be retarded to not use the app in China. The advantage of using these app is enormous, I dont think you understand, the convenience is inanse. You can transfer money to your friend instantly, pay for litreally anything, you can litreally pay rent through wechat, all your bills, all the service you need, you can also invest, also borrow money do you get it now? 

By my math there 1.1B people that's over 16, say there is 1.1*.80 = .88 so there is 880M people that have a bank account roughly, say 830M and that's about the same amount of people that have phones too. so there is around 800M that use the app, and remember the pole that have phones would spend a lot more then people without, so you do the math, there is no way it is 40 percent more like 30 or less"

First, FB expenses SBC in P&amp;L in accordance with US GAAP, and they do not provide adjusted EBITDA figures which add this back. Thus, the EBITDA shown includes SBC. 

Second, FB generates FCF which is used to repurchase shares. They are a net repurchaser of shares after SBC. The net repurchases are fairly immaterial compared to the growth in revenue and FCF that is expected.

You could take the approach to add back SBC and factor in future dilution instead of including in P&amp;L, but I think either approach is immaterial to value."
2020-11-02 14:24:33,"Maybe the increase in short haul, electrified, and perhaps automated trucks is a US thing?

https://www.greenbiz.com/article/undercover-trend-electrifying-trucks

I also don't think that it's possible to make the trucks longer here.  First, the shipping container is standardized (though they could add another size, it's unlikely).  Second, we have weight limits on trucks to reduce wear and tear on the roads.

Interesting point about emissions.  I'm not sure what the US is doing there, so I think most of the interest here is driven by lower costs in fuel and maintenance."
2020-11-02 14:21:41,"Six percent of the US population *does not even have a bank account*  Their dealings are entirely in cash.  There is a larger segment with accounts who also deal in cash.

Unless you plan to heartlessly to cut off ~10% of the US population from all money, removing cash as an option is a bad idea."
2020-11-02 13:48:43,That 1.2 billion users is spread over more than 100 countries. I wish i could give you more up to date info but the most recent articles i could find were a year old but listed the number of alipay users in china at  577million and 802million total mobile payment users. Which is huge no doubt but with a population of 1.4billion i feel like 40% of transactions being cash is not unreasonable. Especially considering about 500million of those people live in rural areas.
2020-11-02 13:31:56,"I went last year and purchased things with cash. I was a tourist though. The US version of wechat doesnt even allow mobile payment. 

Thus, cash payment will be necessary. I did not disagree with you that the majority if not all use mobile payment for everything."
2020-11-02 13:30:28,Is this sarcasm?  Or is the person below getting downvoted because people really don't think economics existed until Adam Smith?
2020-11-02 13:24:48,"Yeah, but that is actually quite a niche portion of the market, not to mention those vehicles have such routes their emissions are already much lower than long haul. 

I don't think automated trucks are here, or will be for some time. What I already see is larger and larger trucks (longer than 25,5m) implemented. Better scheduling, planning, etc will also help.

Electric and automatic trucks will have the advantage of not having to compete against anything, due to the lack of supply for transportation and the looming covid-19 depression, they will simply be in addition to whatever exists.

For Europe, companies and governments are already tightening the pollution limits for transportation. If there was a functioning electric truck out there, or if there will be one in the next 5 years, it will most likely be sold out instantly, due to the fact the owners won't have to worry about replacing their vehicle due to emission limits."
2020-11-02 12:53:36,"Look at the asterisks, its data from 2018 or before. Look at ant financials ""Alipay, which serves over one billion users and 80 million merchants, with total payment volume (TPV) transaction reaching CN¥118 trillion in June 2020"". You see that one billion users, that's literally everyone in China. 118 trillion CNY do you see how insane that number is? That's more than the GDP of China last year."
2020-11-02 12:50:57,"Clearly you haven't went recently. If you have gone to China in the past 3 years you would know everything is cashless. Beggers on the street use QR code to receive cash... Or you are just a foreigner so clearly, you are not able to set up the app and not take advantage of it, or you are just a poor observer. Obviously they still accept cash except in certain stores, but I guarantee you, if you stop someone on the street in China 95% of they don't carry a wallet."

Well, if they were actually trying to do any analysis on whether the fund they were investing their money into got lucky or if they were actually skillfully demonstrating alpha, then yes, I would assume this is something they would want to know.

But in reality? Especially these days given the primary investor base that is putting money into the ark funds, no, I don't think they care that much. But that's just my relatively biased impression, I'm not actually caring that much to do any real analysis here.

&gt;You seem mostly mad that the stock didn't do what you thought it would do and prove you right.

Why, because I'm pointing out that a fund's DD was way off base?

FWIW, I've been long TSLA, I've been short TSLA. I've been long TSLA volatility, and I've also been periodically short TSLA volatility.  I've had a few losses, but am net profitable trading it on occasion. I'm not particularly emotional about anything I own. I will go both ways on just about anything  depending on market conditions. I largely invest / trade based off a model I built and don't really have favorites or emotional attachments to positions. Take that FWIW of course.

2.  I would much prefer to put everything on a credit card that I can to get the cash back and have the various protections and perks those afford than use those services.

3.  Money kept with Square, Venmo, Paypal is not FDIC insured.  If my typical account balance was $1000, I wouldn't care... but with more appreciable amounts that does matter.  Square is making a move in that direction, but focusing on business accounts.

4.  No interest on money kept with those services.   Granted with current interest rates that hardly matters, but free money is free money.

5. The times you need some extra service:  cashiers checks, cash on demand, short term loans, etc... I don't know how I would get those through a payment processor like venmo.  


The times I would consider using those services as a bank:  If I had a business where I was primarily getting paid through them (primarily personal services/boutiques).  In that case, I would also try to pay as many of my suppliers as possible through it so money didn't have to change locations too many times.  I would still maintain a seperate, private bank account though."
2020-11-02 08:26:54,"&gt; but this seems like mental gymnastics. 

Please elaborate how?

Their ***bull thesis*** for why TSLA would be worth $4000 pre split was that there would be one million self-driving taxis on the road by now. That has not even remotely happened, and we're probably at least 3-5 years in an optimistic world from this potentially happening. Yet the price went up to nearly 4000 anyway.

So basically, their DD, bull thesis, and reason to be bullish were hilariously wrong, yet it didn't matter because people bought the stock regardless. Then even though they were hilariously offbase, they somehow get credit for being geniuses for no reason other than the fact that their funds performed well because they were sitting on the right style factor that the market rotated into post pandemic."
2020-11-02 08:20:57,"They've invested in high beta technology companies in a bull market. You could throw darts at companies that fit this factor profile and done well over the last 3-5 years.

Actively managed tech funds also killed the market in 1998, 1999, etc, then the dotcom bubble fell apart and they were all lambasted for not knowing better in hindsight. Yet at the time people who were making enormous gains were celebrating the success of their funds. 

The point I'm making here is that judging a fund's success based off 1 year returns is not a basis for evaluating a fund's success, especially when those returns are simply a matter of being on the right side of the bull market from a factor perspective."

2019-01-08 18:46:01,"The complexities and moving parts are the best part of the model! That's how you gain understanding and hopefully gain some sort edge, especially in more complex businesses.

This may just be my internal conflicts of interest talking (after all I work for a firm that professionally manages other people's money - so we want more folks to outsource their investment research), but I think someone with a moderate amount of time shouldn't be doing that! They should either be doing full on, private equity style due diligence, or they should put their money in an index fund. I don't think there's much in between. Maybe the in between thing is something like looking at a stock screener and investing in all of the companies that meet that screen (basically a form of indexing). 

There's also room for wallstreetbets folks who don't really have any investment rationale, but those people also have no need for a rigorous valuation tool."
2019-01-08 18:39:04,"I think those are good points, especially about getting familiar with the business. What about folks who understand the importance of valuations in certain types of investment strategies, but don't necessarily want to learn all of the complexities and moving parts that comes with constructing a model? It would be nice to have a reliable, structured, easy way to do the number-crunching. It would enable someone with a moderate amount of time to dedicate for investing to screen for stocks, valuate the results, and thoroughly investigate any under-valued companies for potential investment. What do you think?"
2019-01-08 18:25:34,"But this doesn't seem like a product useful to any niche. On one hand you have folks who are interested in investing but don't know how to do valuation. Those folks should just learn how to do valuation! The point of building a model isn't to come up with an output number. The point of a model is the process - familiarizing yourself with the business, the adjustments, the historical financials. A large part of the mechanical excercise is just understanding how the company makes money and how that flows.

On the other hand you have folks who are interested in investing but are not interested in valuation. Those folks should not be investing in individual stocks! They would be much better served investing in low cost index funds.

Valuation on its own provides little to no value (and sometimes negative value to someone who should have just put their money in an index!)"

2019-01-08 13:44:10,"So I’ve been watching British American Tobacco and have been considering taking a position. 

I see the dividend is currently yielding 7.88% with a payout of 11.20%. Safe by most conservative accounts.

However, I calculated that BTI pays about 5.896B in dividend payments annually while recording a FCF of less than 5B for 2017.

I understand that the payout ratio is calculated using net income, but wouldn’t it make more sense to use Free cash flow to evaluate how much the company can “afford” to pay out. 

What I figure is, since the dividend is paid out quarterly, the company has some breathing room. Either way, looking for some clarity on how best to evaluate.

2019-01-08 11:59:23,"I mean honestly, do you think they haven’t thought of this before? This is not a $10m company with 20 yr old execs running it.  They live and breathe the industry day in day out, and they are not so dumb to have not thought about the price point and the margin compression it has caused.

So the next question becomes: why have they not already done this? Several hypotheses:

(1) Busy integrating FDO, and a price change is not something simple to do concurrently.

(2) Consumer taste is weird.  There is no shortage of companies that have made radical changes like this and faced severe backlash.  Take the example of Playboy.  Some time ago they decided to discontinue nude photos. They probably ran the numbers before they did that and it made rational sense on paper, but customers revolted and they were forced to bring back the old Playboy.  There are many other examples like this that I can’t think of right now but when a consumer brand changed something about their core identity or product after so long and it didn’t work.  Few companies have the luxury of shoving any changes down consumers’ throats like Facebook did over the years with changes to newsfeed or privacy and it’s only bc they had a monopoly on social media.

Given what is going on in the retail space these days and all the threats the industry faces, it is a very big gamble to change price points.  It may pay off tremendously, but it’s a gamble and you have to be prepared for the scenario where it backfires.  Now if it does, sales tank, and given the debt load of the company and a possible recession in the next couple years, can they still get through the storm safely?  I’m not sure."

2019-01-08 11:19:08,"\&gt; what are the types of things PMs are typically looking for  

There are a TON of things that you need to look for in stressed &amp; distressed situations. 

You need to take into account the cash flow profile of the issuer and whether or not they'll be able to cover their interest, fund operations, invest in the business, etc but that really just scratches the surface and can be taken care of with a few leverage and coverage ratio calculations. 

You need to take a step back and figure out why the capital structure is even stressed in the first place. Is it a good business that just took on too much debt and needs to figure it out? Or is this a bad business that would probably struggle under any amount of debt? 

Can they organically de-lever through growing cash flow? Or are there non-core assets that the Company is able to sell to de-lever? What about just refinancing the debt? Then you need to take into consideration the refi market, what lenders are willing to do, and if there is a target credit profile the Company would need to reach before refing might be open to them. 

You also need to factor in the Company doing stupid things that make the situation worse. Creditors can influence management by having a relationship, but they're not required to do what you say unless a) you've taken the keys from them in a restructuring or b) they want to do something that requires the consent of a specific lender class. 

A lot of times, you have equity owners who can really influence the management team to the detriment of creditors. Selling assets for proceeds, or using internal cash flow, to pay down debt might increase the credit profile of a company, but most equity owners prefer cash to be used for dividends or share buybacks. There are a lot of times when a company might be better off paying down debt, but instead buyback a ton of stock. You need to weigh the likelihood of this happening. 

Whether you're looking at bank debt or bonds there will be a credit agreement or indenture which lay out what assets you may (or may not be) secured by as well as the different covenants (rules) the Company needs to follow to avoid being in violation of those agreements. Most credit investors get burned here because understanding these documents requires either paying lawyers to interpret them or putting on your own legal hat and figuring it out for yourself. This is personally one of my favorite parts of the credit analysis. 

Some stressed bank debt might look like it offers an attractive return because you have security in whatever asset of the Company, but the credit agreement might actually have some loop holes that would transfer that asset (and security) away from your collateral package and leave you in an unsecured position. It takes a careful read through of the legal docs to figure this out. 

Things get more complicated once you start trying to figure out what the other players in the capital structure want to do. There is a fair amount of game theory here, especially when you're distressed and going through a reorganization process. The creditor class at the bank debt level has different incentives than the creditors at the secured bond level who have different incentives than the creditors at the unsecured level. 

For instance, you might buy distressed unsecured debt because you figure that in a reorganization your debt will actually receive most of the new equity and you want to be in this fulcrum security. However, the guys at the secured bond level also want to own the Company so they will argue that the valuation of the Company should actually be lower when it comes out of bankruptcy, thereby giving themselves the majority of equity. A situation like this comes down to a valuation fight in court where very minute details will make a difference. (If I remember correctly, in the Horsehead case the valuation fight came down to the WACC calculation methodology or something). 

Things can get even more complicated when you start worrying about different subsidiaries, what is in those boxes, and who is entitled to it. 

There is a stressed situation I'm currently involved in where, for example, the consolidated balance sheet shows $100mn of cash. However, that cash is located at the parent holding company level. The bank debt at the operating company level does not have a claim on it, nobody does. There are unsecured creditors at the holding company level who are suing the parent company who plans on transferring this $ to the operating company. Their argument, even though they are unsecured,  is that because no one has security in this cash it belongs to them because they are in the same box as the cash. 

What these creditors are doing is really just playing game theory with the Company, who is in the middle of trying to restructure their operations, by betting that they will be such a torn in their side the Company will find a way to pay them off just to go away rather than stay involved in a protracted legal case. 

See, a situation like that has very little to do with common financial analysis. 

Heres another example of where things can get tricky. Not so long ago certain hedge funds were short the stock of this tech company because they believed in the next quarter they would violate their leverage covenant and declare bankruptcy. The quarter came, and the company actually reported an improved leverage ratio even though their operations continued to decline. How was this possible? 

Reading the lengthy definition of the EBITDA used in their leverage ratio would've given you the answer. This calculation specifically excluded the losses of any operations that belonged to unrestricted subsidiaries. Over the quarter, the company created several unrestricted subsidiaries (which was properly disclosed) and invested the assets of the money losing business segments into it. Therefore, they did not need to include these losses into their calculation and showed an improved leverage ratio that was compliant with the banks. Regardless of whether this was ethical or not, the company lived to fight another day. 

I could continue writing about this for a while because I'm really just scratching the surface, but I think you should start to get the idea of how investing in stressed and distressed situations requires a very different mindset than what you might see for an equity analysis or par fixed income analysis.

So having a discount rate of 10-15% for any given company is a rather normal set when using it in DCF analysis? Is it a rather low measure of what I should expect from a company I want to own? Is 25% actually reasonable to assume from a company that has to convince you that it's worth owning?"

The staples are cheap as hell and workable for people on low incomes/bachelors who just need “good enough” stuff that will get tossed or replaced soon. 

Things I’ve purchased at DLTR: Silverware, shower liners, soaps, spatulas (all their kitchen stuff is dope for the money, honestly), picture frames, and all kinds of other stuff. Even if it was priced at $2 an item, I would have bought just as much. It would still be cheaper than alternatives. (Why pay $4 for an Apple corer in the produce section of a grocery when DLTR has one for a buck?)

If it were convenient, I’d still be a DLTR shopper, even though I don’t fit the profile at all. 

The big question to me is whether the $1 or less pricing strategy is important for traffic. I always went to DLTR vs Dollar General or Family Dollar because I knew everything would be $1. 

I suspect their average customer can’t or won’t travel further for a competing store, and raising prices would offset traffic loss, but it’s something to think about. "

2019-01-07 23:25:34,"Upside is capped, yeah, but imo that has little bearing on ability for PMs to deliver differentiated performance.

Imagine hypothetically that you can predict if a horrible credit will actually muddle through and maintain their payment schedule. You can pick those bonds up for cents on the dollar and when they miraculously pull through to par you'll have equity-plus returns to show for it. Now push this example back along the risk spectrum and you can better understand how credit analysis can produce alpha. Somewhat differently from in equities, the 'value angle' is already baked into the nature of analyzing a bond since its just PV of CFs

There are also explicitly constrained rates portfolios, where the prospective variability around the benchmark is low by design. I assume that's not what you're referring to – that profession is based around understanding cpi/nfp prints, market liquidity, UST auctions and flows, etc etc.

If it's your kind of thing, the distressed space probably offers the greatest prospects for differentiation.

As @abeecrombie said, avoid referring broadly to FI: someone holding a long IG book hugging the benchmark and doing a little credit analysis is in a very different world from someone trading the curve with swaps or an unconstrained bond manager taking huge FX risk"

2019-01-07 21:14:44,"It's not just raising the prices, though, is it?

Assuming dollar stores are the same as the £1 stores I'm familiar with, they commission products packaged more size-appropriate packages - e.g. if the major supermarkets are selling 100g of KP peanuts for £1.25, they order 80g packets of peanuts for their stores.

As the prices of goods rise it probably becomes inefficient, at some point, to package them in smaller and smaller pack sizes just to accommodate the arbitrary £1 price point - the cost of the packaging (inventory etc) steadily increases relative to the cost of the content. At some point you're better off returning to a normal sized packet of goods and increasing the price.

I would guess that fixating on the $1 price point has reduced the margins of some goods and removed many others from their shelves, as it's no longer cost effective to sell those items. I guess there maybe be some higher margin lines they may be able to reintroduce if they add in $1.25 and $1.50 price points.

(VAT is unified throughout the UK, and always included in the ticket price, so his remarks about sales tax are eye-opening to me - in a £1 store, that is exactly what you pay.) "

You're never going to get a perfect WACC no matter how academic your approach is. And even if you get your WACC in an academic manner, the EV will still be unstable.

The point of the WACC sensitivity is to weigh how value changes versus the current price of the business/asset and then evaluate margins of safety. Ie, if a company is fairly priced at 25% WACC, and a screaming buy at 20%, then you may have an attractive investment. In contrast, if you have a business that needs a 5% WACC to justify its current price, and you view the company's prospects as far riskier than what a 5% WACC would suggest, it's probably not a good investment."

An academic answer should be revising your hypothesis again (start over), generate a list of comparable firms (existing and ones that died in the past), regress a WACC, and apply it to your model.      
This is for firms with great uncertainty such as startups. However, there's uncertainty with this method as well which is the accessibility of data.

High switching cost:

- Logistics software (say the software that connects the chain of inbound to warehouse to last mile to delivery for e-commerce for instance).  High switching costs because it's mission-critical and any change may disrupt the whole chain unless the existing solution is crap, but nobody would switch to a cheaper option because of cost if it is delivering on quality.

-  ERP systems: these are so expensive and take such a long time to implement and encompass so many departments that it's a big deal to replace or switch.

- Accounting software: again, if it's working fine, you wouldn't switch for lower cost but again, acctg software doesn't cost much anyway

Low switching costs:

- Fleet management software
- Marketing software (marketing automation, email management/campaigns software, etc)
- Business analytics software: execs in most organizations have such poor view of underlying analytics of their business that if they have a software that delivers analytics in a high quality way, they will always keep it and not change for something cheaper.  They love nice dashboards and all so I guess this one falls under the bucket that the end users of software are usually decision-makers in the organization and switching may risk the quality of their decisions.

2019-04-12 14:14:20,The true reason of Japan and South Korea are seemingly undervalued is that there's no hostile takeover at all. there's no single record of hostile takeover for past decade. imagine a world without hostile takeover. owner could just sit on pile of cash and don't dividend to shareholders at all or put capital into shit rate of return business but still no one can pressure them to change or take it over. what the market can do except punish it with low valuation?

&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt; Upon completion of the transaction, the Company contributed $345 million of cash, contracts in the region including Rider, Driver Partner, and meal delivery contracts, and certain employees in the region to MLU B.V. Concurrent with completion of the transaction, the Company issued 2 million shares of Uber Technologies, Inc. Class A common stock with a fair value of $52 million to MLU B.V.’s parent, Yandex. These shares are subject to a put/call feature resulting in Uber Technologies, Inc.’s contingent obligation to buy back these shares at $48 per share after twelve months from the closing date   
&gt;  
&gt; In exchange for consideration contributed, the Company received a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and a 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V., which remained unchanged as of December 31, 2018. Certain contingent equity issuances to employees of MLU B.V. may dilute the Company’s equity ownership interest to approximately 35%.

Thanks for reading. To my knowledge, the businesses were not being shopped before the merger. The CEO of the SPAC company met with the CEO of Target's parent company (TDR) and discussed the idea of a business combination with Target after TDR sold Williams Scotsman (in a similar SPAC IPO fashion). The premise being that Target was now the lone US based asset in Algeco Global's portfolio (underneath TDR) and didn't fit with the direction Algeco Global wanted to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to the 424b, Platinum Eagle had multiple other offers on the table, and even had a merger they were close to going through with until they found out about Target. I don't think they over-paid for the business -- they paid right around 8.5x 2019 EBITDA, which is well in line with Target's closest comparables (Mobile Mini, Aramark, etc.) and below industry averages &gt;10x. I would've been concerned if I saw the SPAC company purchase Target for over 10x 2019 EBITDA."

2017-11-10 12:17:52,"All I'm saying is that, it is possible to have a terminal growth number for a company that is higher than GDP growth. Precisely for the reasons outlined in my response. It doesn't matter if it is theoretically ""wrong"", because people say it will eventually get bigger than the world economy. It doesn't matter because all of the value is in the first 20-30 years of terminal value.

Yes, it is because of the discount rate. Say your terminal year is T, the discount rate is 10% and the growth is call it 2%. Terminal value is the present value of future cash flows (i.e. discounted back to the terminal value date). If we say that FCF in T+1 is 100, then the terminal value is 100 / (WACC-g) = 100 / (10%-2%) = 1,250 (NPV of all future cash flows) or a 12.5x Forward FCF multiple. If you want to decompose the terminal value (and see where the value comes from). The discount factor for each year (i.e. the multiplying factor in order to get to NPV) is 1 / (1+WACC)^T+x.

T+1 cash flow is discounted by (1+10%)^1 = 0.91, T+2 cash flow is discounted by (1+10%)^2 = 0.83, etc.

FCF T+1 = 100, so the NPV of that 100 is 0.91 x 91m = 7.3% of the total terminal value!

Year two FCF T + 2 = 102 and discount factor is 0.83 so NPV is 84.3. The first two years is then 14% of the terminal value. Every year contributes less (in terms of discount factor) to the terminal value. The discount factor in ten years is 1/ (1+10%)^10 = 0.39 and the cumulative contribution to NPV of the first 10 years of the NPV is 662.5 or 53% of TV.

The discount factor in 20 years is 0.15; and year 11-20 contributes to 311 of NPV, cumulatively the first 20 years is then 974 (out of the 1250 in TV) or 78%. The next 10 years is worth 146 in terms of NPV
The cumulative impact of the first 30 years is 1,120 in NPV (90%).

It matters VERY LITTLE what the cash flows of the company is in 200 years, TODAY as the discount factor is 1/(1+10%)^200 or 0.0000005%.

The issue with this site is that people don't understand finance, but still say stuff like ""the perpetuity growth rate can't be higher than the economy"". They say that without understanding the impact of what they are saying (acting confident, thinking that they are right), which is dangerous.

2017-11-10 11:14:06,"For sure, although in some ways, isn't that just the nature of highly leveraged equities? 

Here, the debt / capital ratio is based on book value of real estate that has appreciated since they were originally marked in 2013. According to EY, Class A vacancies hit an 11 year low in 2016 (10%), while average asking rents are up ~16% since 2013. With improved FMV, not only does the debt / cap mix improve, but so does the ability to refi the mortgage debt and pull out cash.

The other 0.6 represents the preferred dividends.

There's a third possibility, which I actually didn't think of initially, but they could approve a one-time partial dividend payment. This way, if there are concerns around the long-term viability of the operations, they are not tied to fully reinstating the dividend, but they work down the overhang. They did make a partial $2.25 payment as part of the 2015 settlement.

2017-11-09 23:20:31,"I just recently came across this company and didn’t realize GE now owns LM. At the same time though, won’t LM lose business from the other turbine manufacturers? Why would Vestas want to do business with its competitor? TPI claims GE will continue to outsource but who knows. I think GE is about to spin out all its assets so I wouldn’t take any promise seriously from those liars. Certainly complicates the matter either way. 

I’m honestly more familiar with HXL (Hexcel) the aerospace fiberglass manufacturer. HXL also does wind blades but it’s a much smaller piece of the business. For aerospace carbon fiber, I do think it’s a good business because there is significant ‘know-how/trade secret’ in their manufacturing process. Also it’s very sticky as it has to go through FAA and Ba/Airbus approval and then it’s pretty much on the plane model for full manufacturing life cycle. There are really only three aerospace grade fiberglass suppliers too, so rationale pricing too.

TPIC claims their fiber is ‘near aerospace grade’ at ‘industrial price.’ I don’t know if I buy that. There are lots of smaller fiberglass suppliers that make inferior product but surely wind turbines are more complex then skis and golf clubs? I think their claim is based more around their built to spec facility strategy. By giving the customer exactly what they want rather then retrofitted or adjusted blades my sense is they can deliver a better quality or maybe cheaper product. There is also lots of risk to this strategy when customers change turbines and don’t re-up TPI. Lastly, they have a large back long with gautaunteed minimums on the contracts so you can presumably model the top line pretty easily for a few years.

I’ve kind of put this one on the backburner because the margins are super low and the business reminds me a lot of E&amp;C businesses which I think are crap.

Reverse question, why is a wind farm or solar scale utility a good business to own? Won’t it’s returns be capped to whatever FERC allows? My understanding is even if costs are lower their margins stay the same as they have to adjust pricing so they stay under their allowed ROE. Please help me out here if I’m totally wrong, I’ve never invested in a utility...

"
2017-11-09 23:06:21,"&gt; Just scan the Moviepass threads around reddit (a bit anecdotal) 

Yeah no. 

&gt;Given their need to raise cash from uncanny sources like HMNY

Funding is funding, don't discriminate. 

&gt;there's no way they will ever reach 10mn members.

Per the MPAA, 11% of US/CDN pop. go to the movies once per month - roughly 35mn in the U.S. Lets make an educated guess that 2/3 of that bought at least ~15 tickets per year, so a little more than once a month. That's 23mn, which is the initial market opportunity for moviepass. 

I'm not Gandalf and claiming that moviepass will earn X amount of any market, I don't even consider it in my analysis, but its a fun exercise. 

Lets make the following assumptions: 10mn moviepass subscribers at 15 tickets/year, and add an addtl. 3 tickets/year as a ""synergy"" of the service. So thats 180mn tickets. Multiplied by 50% as the AMC/RGC/CNK share of traffic thats 90mn tickets which is 14% of 2017 total ticket sales. 10% moviepass revenue share. 

So the breakdown is 75mn tickets as base, and 15mn tickets as incremental. 

The economics on base tickets is $1.1bn revenue for the exhibitors minus $110mn to movie pass. The exhibitors take the $110mn as a hit to revenue AND EBITDA because they are the tickets moviepass subscribers would have purchased anyway and are thus dilutive to EBITDA. 

The same math on incremental tickets works out to $21mn to Moviepass and an incremental $38mn EBITDA gain to the exhibitors. 

So overall, the net revenue imapct is $85mn and EBITDA is -$68mn which is -3% dilutive to 2017E EBITDA of AMC/RGC/CNK. If you bump Moviepass' penetration to 20mn subs it is -6% dilutive to EBITDA. 

So for the Big 3 chains to compete they'll need to price their own service below that of Moviepass' or offer other premiums which'll basically kinda wash out in the math as a breakeven I assume. 

So moviepass, at the end of the day, is pretty much a wash. Having some leverage to flex for a revenue share is pretty accurate, but I also didn't say it'd kill the theaters which I feel is how you're twisting a lot of my comments. 

But anyway, moviepass can still stay above water by selling customer data, etc. "
2017-11-09 22:52:15,"&gt; So can you quantify the PVOD revenue opportunity then? If it's not a theater killer?

Nope, and I don't really care to. 

&gt;What are the main points to the bear thesis otherwise?

1) Over-supply of renovated theaters will be a headwind to attendance/ticket pricing growth at previous rates 2) AMC is a levered equity stub and rapidly running out of levers to pull that benefit equity owners (Euro spin will not be as successful as they claim), 3) Hollywood just isn't making good enough movies to get people to go the movies (see my previous comments in other thread re: aggregate industry ticket sales).

2017-11-09 22:30:16,"On the Q3 earnings call, Adam stated that the average price paid per ticket by Moviepass was ~$11. AMC Stubs has 10 million members, tracking consumer data which in turn is currently being sold to studios for marketing purposes. Moviepass is the epitome of selling $20 bills for $10. They have nothing new to offer and will eventually just run out of money. Just scan the Moviepass threads around reddit (a bit anecdotal) people openly brag about watching 20 movies per month, at 10mn subs (which would bring their data collection to the same level as AMC current Stubs members), they would be burning an astronomical amount of cash. Given their need to raise cash from uncanny sources like HMNY I think demonstrates there's no way they will ever reach 10mn members."

So can you quantify the PVOD revenue opportunity then? If it's not a theater killer? What are the main points to the bear thesis otherwise?

Moviepass is paying full price for tickets and charges $10 a month. There is no way that Moviepass is going to get enough scale to make that much of a disparity disappear. A single ticket costs $13-15. Maybe they could strike a deal with AMC to help fill AMC classic seats. But again, it makes no sense as to why AMC would not roll out its own subscription service instead when they have the scale to do the entire thing themselves and keep all the economics."
2017-11-09 22:11:02,"So 1) I️ specifically said there are non-shitty camera versions of movies available soon after release if you know where to look. And 2) I️ never said PVOD is a theater killer, just that it is likely to happen. I️ think a bigger, more current problem for the theaters is the growing scale of Moviepass. If Moviepass reaches a certain threshold (call it 10mn subs) they’ll have significant leverage over the exhibitors and flex for a revenue share. The theaters can’t compete without offering similar services at a lower price at which point they start cannabalizing their own sales/EBITDA.

2017-11-09 21:38:32,"Yes, camera versions are available but they're often quite shitty.

DVD rips don't come out until 100 days later. And here is my point: Why would people pay $30-50 for PVOD, which consists of a single movie in HD quality downloaded over the internet to play on their TV or whatever, when they can get it for literally free, the same exact thing, when it comes out through torrents? PVOD has to be streamed somewhere, and there's nothing differentiating a PVOD offering from the torrent because people will rip the PVOD stream and upload it as literally the same file. 

People don't do this now because:

A. The quality is shitty. I torrent a lot too as a broke student, and I almost always wait until the DVD comes out and normal quality comes.

B. The aforementioned 100 days.

C. There IS value in the movie theater, or else people would not go now because you can watch movies at home now; the picture and sound quality are so much better, the experience of going out, etc. I don't think people care THAT much about texting or other people talking. Maybe a small but vocal minority.

Again I think 1-5%er Wall Streeters are way overfitting their experiences with PVOD to Middle America, or anyone under the top 10%.

So what do you think the revenue opportunity from PVOD would be then, if you think it is a theater killer?

However, I agree that if somehow it did get done, and it was wildly successful for some unknown reason, AMC would be shut out of the loop almost completely since they have no reason to share in any of the economics, since the studios can set up their own streaming hubs. I'm comfortable with that risk."

I agree. A qualitative framework such as Porter's Five Forces is unlikely to yield a consistent security analysis process with repeatable returns.

The Incentive Distribution Right (IDR) is also a very important detail.  They're usually set at a fixed $ amount distribution per LP unit.  This almost guarantees the LP investors get screwed by the GP through a drop downs.

Effectively the drop down uses LP equity to buy an asset.  But the IDR means that you don't get the full cashflow benefit of the asset the GP is dropping down to the GP - usually up to 50% of the cashflow benefit flows up to the GP.  So the LP is putting up all the cost, but seeing as little as 50% of the upside...."

People will still go to movies, but will it be AMC and not the Alamo Drafthouses of the world? AMC's leverage certainly requires them to find significant success in the near/mid term.

Look at the efforts of Canadian chain Cineplex ($CGX). They are building out entertainment zones and more activity focused revenue sources (including Esports involvement), which require strategic and capital flexibility, which AMC is lacking. 

Selling off a portion of their top assets and most promising theaters that they recently bought, in order to save a struggling business, does not give me much faith in management.  "

What I'm saying here is nothing more than what Papa Buffett said a couple of weeks ago. The video shouldn't be too hard to find. Buffett keeps things simple. I'm sure there is a better estimate than 20% out there but it's probably not all that important since we had been in a strong bull market long before we knew we were getting a big corporate tax cut. The market does what it does.
"
2018-01-28 16:38:10,"Before the money can be returned to American shareholders, it must go back to the US. So the value of AAPL shares is less at 35% than 21% because we know the money will be taxed upon repatriation, which is a prerequisite for shareholder returns. These companies can skirt this rule to some extent by borrowing money in the US  against their foreign cash to return to shareholders but this is more of a short term solution to do while they wait for a one-time repatriation deal than a long term solution to avoid taxes, since now they have a US liability that they will need to repatriate to pay.

So yes you are right, for companies like AAPL they were never going to pay 35%, maybe the market had priced in the strong likelihood of one-time tax break and so the value wouldn't go up 20% as described. For a lot of US companies, their equity value really did go up 20%. 

And of course there are other factors that go into effective tax rate since the tax code is very complicated. Bottom line is yes you are right, so it's a little less but 20% is probably not too far off"
2018-01-28 16:31:04,"It's going to affect different industries in different ways and only benefit companies with high effective tax rates.

A cursory look at a 3 month share price chart of any US domiciled financial company illustrates your point exactly. These companies had very high effective tax rates which have now fallen as result of the tax reform. Share prices rose as investors priced in higher EPS figures on the same multiple. 

It's unlikely that all of the benefits from a reduced tax rate reach the bottom line in a competitive industry like financials as they are likely to be competed away. Already the California regulator has asked if motor insurers such as Progressive can be forced to pass on tax savings in the form of lower premiums to policyholders. "
2018-01-28 16:21:32,"Disclaimer: Not a quant. Just an interested nerd. Please correct me if I need some correcting, I'd like to learn.

How much of the company's value was taxable in the first place? When considering the real valuation of Google, do you consider Google's offshore and tax sheltered assets? (I really don't know...) If so, I assume that you must now look at how much money the company is keeping sheltered. Then how the lowering of taxes may effect that sheltering behavior."
2018-01-28 16:11:13,"That makes sense on first glance.  I'll be curious to see if anyone argues against it.

What remains odd is that we didn't really see a quick 20% gain in the markets after the new tax bill.  One could argue it baked in before the bill was signed, though.  I guess I'm just trying to tease out how much of the gains of the last few months is due to the impact of better value vs. ""melt-up""."
2018-01-28 16:05:50,"Well if the average effective tax rate goes from X-&gt;Y, then the increase in true ownership of the business's earnings increases from (1-X) to (1-Y), which if you assume 35% to 21%, means it goes from 65% to 79%, or an increase of 20% or so in value.

He think he will be right in the long term, I think he will be right in the long term, the difference is that I don't want to risk my capital on shorts so I don't lose money in the short term if there are more retards than non-retards.

If you think overvalued is a good enough reason to short then you would've be been burned on many many growth tech stocks in the past several years. 

Enron hit 90 before zero, again different, but shows you how stupid people are.

If you don't think Amazon is replicable I suggest you open your eyes and look around. 

Walmart and target are investing heavily into e-commerce, and believe it or not you can find many items on Walmart for a cheaper price than Amazon. Target is going hard for one day shipping, while Amazon is struggling with two. 

Look at how fast azure is growing, hint, it's faster than AWS.  Or BABA, 120%. You think it's hard to stick couple of servers in a warehouse? It's not. Cloud pricing is basically down 10% a year.

2018-01-27 20:53:50,"""Amazon is like oil"" is such a non-argument that there's nothing to debate. Retail is not at all like oil. 

I take people who put their money where their mouth is seriously. If you're not even willing to trade based on your opinions, why should anybody be willing to listen to them?

David Einhorn is short Amazon. He clearly doesn't think ""you can still lose money as long as there are more dumb money than smart money."" He's a professional. I would like to hear his short thesis for Amazon, since he is very good at what he does; unfortunately I could not find it.

I am balls deep in Amazon and I found very little of what you said to be accurate. Cloud is a big deal. Even if it does end up competing away its gains, it is going to continue to grow and Amazon's proprietary tools and existing customer base create something of a moat. Amazon runs an extremely efficient retail operation; they have the most advanced fulfillment centers and years of ecommerce experience. They just put out a fully automated grocery store. They have a device that sits in your home that you can ask to order toilet paper for you. None of this stuff is easily replicable. Economies of scale will enable the player with the lowest marginal costs to take an outsized market position, and earn a strong return on investment, just like Walmart did back in its day against its much larger and better funded competitors. 

Amazon is almost without a doubt, the most innovative tech giant of the modern era. Amazon went from 0 to $160B, and maybe another $200B in pass-through revenue, in just 25 years. They have revolutionized multiple industries now. You saying it's overvalued but not be willing to short it, is frankly, ridiculous. "
2018-01-27 20:41:01,"The problem with shorting stocks in general is two-fold.

First, there is the explicit ""cost to borrow"" for shorting stocks that you pay your broker. For stocks like ExxonMobil, the cost of borrow is ~2% per year, but for ""hard to borrow"" stocks (i.e. the stocks everyone wants to short), the cost to borrow can be 20% per year or higher.

Second, when you short stocks, you are fighting against the time value of money - this is the implicit cost to borrow. Stock prices are a capitalized representation of future cash flows to the stockholder, and the future cash flows are discounted to the present value. By shorting, you are paying this implicit discount rate. In other words, by shorting stocks you are fighting the reason why stocks go up in the long-run.

Additionally, if you manage a market neutral portfolio (ignoring explicit costs to borrow, but including them makes your returns worse), why do you expect to earn a return greater than the risk free rate? If your answer is due diligence and research, then you do not need to run a market neutral portfolio. Your research will guide your market exposure."
2018-01-27 20:24:11,"Just because I'm not invested? What kind of moronic logic is that? Debate the merits of the argument, and nothing else. 

Even if you are shorting a fraud, and I'm not saying Amazon is a fraud, you can still lose money as long as there are more dumb money than smart money, and I sure as fuck don't want to lose money.

Is this growth levels of stock prices you refer to, or growth levels of the economy in general.

&gt; Most equities at the moment seem to be pretty fairly valued, within a say 10-15% +/- margin.

Why do you say that, please?

And a 10-15% +/- margin to what?

I don't know much, but compared to the 10-year PE ratio (Shiller-CAPE) I don't see how the price of the S&amp;P 500 is sustainable. "
2018-01-27 18:08:30,Let's see your short position.
2018-01-27 17:57:48,"Well there were three rate hikes last year, they just had one in December from 1.25% to 1.50% and there three more planned planned for 2018 and 2019.  So they are starting to pump the brakes a little.  But general consensus seems to be that current growth levels are healthy so there have not been any major hikes, which I think they would like to stay away from.  Unless something changes from their plan, you see the hikes come in 25 basis point (0.25%) increments, with enough time in between for the market to slowly adjust instead to large jarring changes.   

Most equities at the moment seem to be pretty fairly valued, within a say 10-15% +/- margin.   They do seem to be trending to the high side though.   So if it keeps going it might be a different story in 12-18 months.

I identified areas where it seemed to me that your understanding was flawed. It's not an attack on character in any way.

Also, you still haven't addressed my arguments at all. Even if asset managers are in actuality asset gatherers, this still doesn't make sense for your reasoning for why people short. Under the assumption that shorting is a losing proposition, not shorting and having higher returns **or** shorting with no results should both be superior for asset gathering than taking substantial short positions. Nor have you responded to my claim that your basis of comparison is inappropriate, both because you are assuming a level of beta that is not there, and because short funds are intended to offer a different type of exposure, not just straight upside."
2018-01-27 15:58:14,"Generally the idea of positive expectancy in equity markets would be dependent on beta. A beta neutral portfolio of equities would not carry any equity risk premia that would generate positive expectancy. I think what you would like to do is to build a portfolio of alpha though hedging, which is a very reasonable idea. 

I would add that generally you would want to short higher beta equities that you are long. This way you would still have a positive net exposure to equity markets while having a zero equity beta in a sell off. "

What I'm trying to say with the beta point is more that unless you are drawing on your capital gains at a given, pre-established time or are trading on margin and need prices to stay up to avoid calls (both of which are super risky IMO) hedging for short term price movements won't actually lower the risk of lack of sufficient capital/income in the future (which I'm assuming is what you're hoping to correct for, I might well be wrong) and, unless stocks suddenly stop creating value for shareholders, will probably cost you money in the long run.

2018-01-27 15:24:37,"If you are trading spreads, it may be better just to use options. As to your question of using shorts to be ""market neutral"" that is absolutely an appropriate use. Your main concern will be the interest on the ""loan"" of shares as you short. It depends on the length of time that you plan to hold the positions in your portfolio. I don't know what the ""negative responses"" to shorting you have seen are, but it is absolutely a good tool when used correctly. Directional shorts (betting on a drop) are a very small percentage of short transactions, they are more frequently used to offset other positions for arbitrage profits (like merger arb) or going market-neutral. From your post though, you might be better served using option spreads to achieve your trading goals."

I don't disagree that beta is a bad measure, but my main point is that I don't want my portfolio to become the same trade (long stocks), during market sell-offs.  I'd like to take positive expectancy bets that remain fairly uncorrelated at all times."
2018-01-27 15:16:55,"I'm working on learning equity analysis as well but personally I agree with Buffetts stance that beta is a poor measure of risk (and by extension using shorter term price changes to quantify risk in any form) 

If, however you really want to hedge with this it may not be more expensive (and could well be safer due to not having to pay dividends, etc) to just use puts.

Also it's worth noting that correlations tend to rise during bear markets (people get scared and sell everything). IMO this helps to lead to mispricing which is helpful for those who practice equity analysis"

2018-01-27 14:54:37,"You are assuming a portfolio beta of 1, which is a pretty arbitrary assumption, especially when the desired goal is often a beta of 0 or slightly negative.

Kinda nitpicking here, but not really. The market over long periods of time *has* gone up an annualized 7%. Not *will*.

Also this whole argument of shorting solely for the reason of raising comp... what the fuck? It makes no sense whatsoever. If I decide to start shorting so I can charge more, and if it is inherently a money-losing proposition as you claim, then it'll reduce my returns and lower my incentive comp. This makes it harder to attract and retain clients, making it even harder for me to take home a big paycheck. At best, I would have extremely small position sizes on stocks that don't really move, so I can charge this hypothetical ""shorting premium"" but not have it negatively impact returns. This isn't what you're seeing at all. There is some disconnect in your thinking.

If you think of investing in terms of just total returns and not with the added dimension of risk, then the entire concept of hedge funds will not matter to you, and this is probably why you seem kind of hostile to the HF industry. I also don't know why you would even bring up alpha in the first place, if you ""think of investing as a way to make money.""

This is not to say there are not shitty managers or managers who are simply looking to leech off clients, but they are certainly no longer around today (or they have gotten much better at hiding!).

Do you actually have any experience in HF or asset management work? I'd be very surprised if so, because you seem to have a poor grasp on motivations. If you don't have experience or lack in-depth knowledge through other means, maybe you should stop making these assertions."

2018-01-27 14:19:30,"That’s not how monopolies work. If I had to make a bet, I would guess that hedge fund assets will be substantially lower 20 years from now than today. It’s a dying industry, just like mutual funds. The move to passive and lower fees is a big force. All industries do not experience compressed margins and a surge of competition."
2018-01-27 14:17:30,"It’s not secular decline, it’s normal maturation of an industry that enjoyed unsustainable margins during a period of exceptional growth which has now begun to level off just as consumers (institutional and HNW investors) have become more educated about the true cost of providing the service they’ve been paying for, and potential (even if imperfect) substitutes have emerged. Margins compress and competition surges. That’s how industries work. "
2018-01-27 14:01:17,"It terms of pure macro, I feel anyone who has not dedicated their career to the space is always going to feel somewhat behind the curve. In reality that is absolutely reasonable - anyone focused on US equities in all likelihood does not need to know what is happing with Italian debt and should not be expected to know certain nuances in the macro space. If there are macro guys you talk to, I've always found people to be very interested to discuss the things they are working on. 

In terms of thematic equity ideas, the generation of themes tends to be somewhat emergent from whatever framework you use to think about the world. Do you feel the market and regulatory environment will continue to favor large cap firms with somewhat monopolistic pricing power? Amazon, Pfizer, Airlines (despite recent Delta wage increases) might be good ideas. Do you think that grocers will continue to face increased competition from Aldi, Amazon, and other entries into their market? Maybe short the worst of the legacy grocers. Hard data supporting these sorts of themes is always nice but may funds don't see it as strictly necessary.

As for resources, again letters of funds you respect are likely the best resource. If you do not have access to them via your career, that makes things harder. I would suggest reaching out to funds via their public IR email and sending them something along the line of ""I am an independent investor (looking at opportunities in the alternatives space) and would be interested in knowing more about the fund - could you send over a fund presentation and recent letters?"" I would imagine this would work better if you have even a small family office or LLC but regardless it never hurts to ask. "
2018-01-27 13:55:10,"I think of investing as a way to make money. Not to generate alpha. The market over long periods of time will go up 7%. That means if you have “alpha” of 7% you are essentially generating a 0% return. If you generate alpha of 0% with shorting you are generating a -7% return since that is the same as shorting the market. I don’t understand individual investors inclination to short the market. Per what somebody else said, the reason why Einhorn and other hedge fund managers short the market isn’t to make their clients more money; it’s so that they can get paid 1.5 / 20."
2018-01-27 13:48:08,"How do you figure that 7% alpha results in 0% returns, or that 14% alpha is necessary to match sp500...?

Also, it seems your entire basis of comparison is poor. You are comparing alpha only versus the pure beta of the SP500. Furthermore, why are you even using the SP500 in the first place? A portfolio of shorts is supposed to be uncorrelated and provide returns in a downside scenario, you probably don’t invest in a short fund hoping to outperform SPY during bull markets."

But I've always been curious where people source ideas or ways of generating these sorts of things. I am in no way a macro guy, having historically always done equities in local markets but I feel like when I listen to macro investors talk I am so out of the loop with happenings in that space. So I'm just looking for resources to learn/analyse macro themes so I'm not so behind the ball when talking with others."
2018-01-27 12:19:46,Cost to borrow is too high.
2018-01-27 12:11:41,"The Fed uses interest rates to try to regulate the general state of the economy and inflation rate.   If it sees that things are getting over heated it will begin raising rates.  Borrowing becomes more expensive so returns on investments shrink.   Generally some asset class that is overly leveraged will now be unsustainable and pop goes the weasel.   People panic, lending and investment tightens as everyone looks to protect their capital.  Hey we've got a recession.   

The Fed will begin lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and investments, and the whole process starts over again.   Which generally takes around 8-12 years to run the complete cycle.  



"
2018-01-27 12:04:17,"This sounds to me like thematic investing which is and has been a fairly common flavor of L/S equity strategies. Typically themes are not grounded in pricing commodities but rather sectoral views. One might, for example, be bullish Indian insurers and private banks as a whole given certain economic and population dynamics in India. More tactically, one may have looked to short real estate in the UK after Brexit or to go long US banks after the 2016 US elections. 

Sellside reports are generally not ideal for informing these themes as they are largely written by sector analysts with a generally narrow view of the investment universe. I would suggest reading letters of thematic hedge funds if you have access to them.

I disagree whole heartedly with other commenters that the data needed to for top down analysis is at all proprietary. Markets do not lead macroeconomic trends, forecasts are not necessary - the value comes much more from recognizing trends and constructing exposure to trends in an intelligent and risk managed way. 

If you're looking specifically at ideas in the energy space, I would suggest considering hedging out your oil exposure or looking for the most convex opportunities available. An attempts to forecast oil prices is at least in some part an attempt to geopolitics which is never the easiest thing to do."
2018-01-27 12:02:51,"Completely disagree,  decades ago we called those conglomerates. Amazon took it a step further by investing price to the max. Without a pursuit of profit, PERIOD, of course they can afford to grow rapidly.

Unfortunately it doesn't take much to replicate that mentality. Walmart and target are actively trying to catch up, and again, it doesn't take much as long as they throw money at the problem, which they are. Target is coming out with same day delivery and Walmart is investing in Jets Like crazy. On the cloud side everyone and their mothers are coming out with an offering and price is consistently dropping.

What is masking this highly competitive dynamic is that both e-commerce and cloud businesses are experiencing rapid secular growth, the pie is getting bigger. As with any industry, once the landscape saturates, growth will stop and you will see the stock price collapse.

If you want to see the future of e-commerce/cloud just look at oil. Anyone could frack and frackers made loads of money in 2013 and 2014, and invested every penny back into the business, but profits got competed away and only artificial supply restriction/collusion lifted profits back up.

The same will happen to Amazon."
2018-01-27 11:42:43,"Many thanks, you've helped me understand bonds a lot better.

When the Fed lowered interest rates in 2009, did they do so to make cash more readily available to troubled companies, or to make bonds less attractive to investors?"
2018-01-27 11:35:59,"Generally yes if equities crash, then bond prices will rise.  Not only due to perceived lower risk, but also to the expectation that interest rates may continue falling.  So its a mix of supply/demand, risk, return.

Interest rates in 2008 were around 5% when the shit hit the fan.  They continued falling to around 0.5% in early/mid 2009 as the FED scrambled to slow the crash.   Prices rose, especially on the higher interest notes, as investors dumped their money into the safest place they could think of.    Prices then normalized after people realized the world wasn't ending and money started moving into equities and other opportunities that were selling at a huge discount.

Here your purchase price drives your return. Your purchase price drives your return (this is important so I say it twice). You want all your capital to be returned as growth will be value destructive in this no growth scenario. It doesn’t matter whether the companies ROIC on in-place capital is 10% or 15% the price is what matters for no growth or growth challenged (no additional value creating investments) companies"
2018-01-27 10:31:24,"Appreciate the response, no I'm not trying to beat the street on macro outlook. The thing is though I have very little insight to macro outlooks at all.

But now my issue come when someone asks me where I see oil the commodity going next year or what my target price is. Obviously different oil prices are built into my model from different sources and their outlooks, but I dont really know how to arrive to these figures myself"
2018-01-27 10:06:45,"Here's a dirty little secret:

**Short selling is incredibly profitable. Insanely profitable in fact, but not for the reason you'd think.**

Shorting stocks allows a ""hedge fund"" to charge 2% &amp; 20%.

Funds that don't short typically can't get away with fees nearly as high. To clarify: shorting is profitable for the fund, not for it's investors.

The reason for this is that fund investors want something that seems reasonable, but is actually unreasonable: low portfolio volatility. 

Volatility isn't risk as most of us know, but it looks scary to the uninformed. Irrationally, they are willing to give up long run returns (in the form of high fund fees and negative expected returns on short positions) in exchange for lower volatility.

Shorts are money losing investments for all the reasons you've probably seen already and a few more you probably don't even realize. Outside of the hedge fund game where you're literally paid to play, it doesn't make economic sense to take short positions.

That said, shorts are super satisfying to get right, but beyond the psychological benefit, there's not much there. I highly recommend you avoid the temptation of short selling.

2018-01-27 09:44:39,Isn’t he just considering tech in case write down of gigantic valuations?
2018-01-27 09:25:40,"Thanks for the explanation. I might've been clearer if I'd kept two sentences as one paragraph.

Let's say bond interest rates are fairly constant and there's a stockmarket crash - don't bond prices go up then?

I think they go up. I don't know which of [these](https://i.imgur.com/CRKZDKa.png) [illustrations](https://i.imgur.com/nmH7Du4.png) is clearer, but there's a positive bump around / after the 2008 crash.

Why did bond prices go up then? Surely because there's a shortage of safe government debt available for investors to buy?

Hence my question - if the government starts issuing bonds with a higher interest rate, I guess that could panic people who are holding those with the lower rate, but will there be enough availability that they're able to get the new bonds at par / interest rate?"
2018-01-27 08:59:54,"Bonds have a set par value (generally $1000) with a set interest rate (coupon rate) when they are first offered by a company/government. So the interest payments will not change based on market price, which is why the market price will fall.   

If the yield on a bond is 2.5% ($1000 par = $25) and the current market rate is 2.5%. Then the bond should sell for par.  If market rates rise to say 5%, no one is going to give you $1000 to get 2.5% ($25) when they can spend $1000 and make 5% ($50).   Interest is paid on the par value so the value of your 2.5 bond will fall to $500, making the $25 interest payment now a yield of 5% .    

That's a very simplistic example, normally you'd have to do some present value calculations to take into account the remaining life of the bond, expectations of more rate increases, etc.  But it is essentially what is happening.    

You're also right that the demand (or lack of) will affect the yield, although you may have it backwards.   Say everyone is scrambling to get out of the 2.5s in our previous example, and trying to get into the 5s.   The 2.5s fall to $300 and the price of the 5s rises to $1500.   Now the yield on the 2.5s is actually 8.3% ($25/300) and the yield on the 5s is 3.3% ($50/1500).   


"
2018-01-27 08:22:16,"A few methods:

1) Some still post financials on their websites or on OTCMarkets.com

2) Some send financials to shareholders, so you can ask for a shareholder to send you one (you can post a request on various investors forums like Corner of Berkshire and Fairfax) or buy 1 share and then ask the company to send you their financials

3) If the company doesn't voluntarily disclose financials to anyone, even shareholders, then you can buy 1 share and make a formal books-and-records request under the relevant state corporation law."

2014-03-09 16:11:52,"I find that a company with a great capital allocator at the helm trading at a discount to book value is the exception rather than the rule. For every Michael Smith at MIL, there is a Pete Miller at NOV, Stiritz at Ralston Purina/Post Holdings, Malone at TCI/Liberty Companies, Prem Watsa at Fairfax, or Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. These companies normally trade at a multiple of book value and are the great, high quality businesses you acquire at a fair price knowing the managers will increase the value of those companies in the future.

This may not be your style of value investing (it isn't in my toolbag quite yet), and may not suit your personality, but there is merit to this approach. My job as a student of investing is to figure out why it works and how to recognize the genesis of this situation in the future.

2014-03-03 20:45:35,"I and many others would argue the best course of action is to find index funds or etf with low expense ratios (around .10% or lower if possible) and just let the investments sit and grow. You shouldn't be constantly meddling with retirement accounts--only checking on them to maybe rebalance if necessary.

With 401ks you're typically very limited to what you can invest in. If your 401k plan has target retirement funds available, you can easily mimic their weightings with the available index funds that have lower expense ratios. Since your projected retirement is many years away, I recommend putting everything in equities. No sense holding fixed income if you don't need to maintain any principal in the near future.

You should have many more options available for an IRA. I would say your best bet is to find some Vanguard index etfs to invest in. They have very low fees and have very low tracking error relative to other companies.

In my opinion, you would typically want an allocation of Large Cap Domestic, Mid Cap Domestic, Small Cap Domestic as well as International developed. Probably wouldn't be a bad thing to throw in some Emerging Markets too"

I'm still working through why a relationship may have existed between TMC/GNP in the past since there's a few variables in there that seem to be independent of each other and would appear to make any relationship correlative rather than causal."

This is why I had stated the 6% was a modest but *acceptable* return. Personally I like to have a hurdle rate of 20% per annum. "
2014-02-28 17:30:43,"I find the opening quote from Buffet interesting, mainly because one of my finance teachers, who was a leading analyst in the paper industry during his time in the finance world, also noted that the true discount rate that should be used is the risk free rate. I agreed with this pattern of logic, but not completely. Mainly because other companies should have higher discount rates above that of the risk free rate for obvious reasons. 

That being said, why would Walmart need such a high discount rate of 10%? That's more/close to 3 times the 30 year rate, so do you really think a company like Walmart, proven and profitable, should receive a 10% discount rate? If anything, I would adjust that growth factor of 7% unless

1) there small shopping local markets are going to give them a continuous boost

2) overseas is doing well

3) small scale stores prove not to eat into big store sales and instead destroys the competition i.e. fresh and easy, kroger, safeway, riteaid etc.

Overall, this is pretty close to how I do my intrinsic value analysis so cheers to that! Missing management plans, industry analysis and country analysis and I think thats about it. Could be wrong.

2014-02-28 16:26:40,"Oh yeah, ive always thought that the vast majority of growth prospects is all in underdeveloped/developing countries in the world. I dont even think spain uses toilets as a mainstay and still uses out houses. 

I always use growth prospects of the company's area of business and base it off of their foreign country's revenues and management/industry analysis. Basically seperate each one. The tough part, if you use discount rates, is factoring in country risk of each one. Havent done a full on analysis in a while now, but i would probably do an ATP of each country and then weight each one based off of a percentage of their revenues they currently take on. "

Tons of earnings (think Apple) are held over seas because the cost of bringing that cash back to the US is high. eBay is another interesting example, wherein they use international cash as reserves for their BillMeLater Credit portfolio. 

Many US transnational companies can have good prospects for growth even if the prospects for US GDP growth are tepid because they can invest wherever they'd like in the world and that won't be reflected in US GDP/GNP but it will benefit shareholders of those companies."

No one made the assertion that market cap &gt; GDP = overvaluation. So why would there be any articles that ""specifically talks about it""? No one is talking about it, not even this article."
2014-02-28 08:56:47,And you are right. This article is not directly addressing that question. But it remains a better critique of it than any article I have found that specifically talks about it - I posted it here because this is relevant to thinking about what kind of businesses you should invest in and where they are located and to the discussion about whether the US stock market is overheated. I like thinking about profitable businesses and their valuation.

2014-02-28 08:42:07,That is what the title of the thread is talking about. But the whole point is that international earnings of US companies do not contribute to GDP but they do contribute to the market capitalization of those companies.

The title of this post is implying that this was a ""given"" and widely accepted, but is it? Does anyone have a paper I can read on why someone made this claim and what the justification behind it is?

The article seems to have very little to do with equity market valuation. The author is contending that variables contributing to the abstract definition of ""national power"" are incorrectly weighted. It doesn't talk about why 100% market cap to GDP is not longer a sign of equity overvaluation."
2014-02-28 03:02:30,"The point is that earnings are global, so comparing them to US GDP doesn't make much sense. In the past, when American-listed companies derived most of their revenues and profits from the US, the market capitalization to GDP actually made sense."

2014-02-26 23:51:03,"&gt; As value investors you want to buy stocks at maximum pessimism because often that's when their market price is at the lowest and you stand to reap the maximum return.

2014-02-26 23:39:46,"As value investors you want to buy stocks at maximum pessimism because often that's when their market price is at the lowest and you stand to reap the maximum return. 

52-week low stocks reflect stocks that are at a point of maximum pessimism. Stocks that have been going up tend not to be undervalued. You may argue that their intrinsic value have been growing and there is a margin of safety between the market price and the intrinsic value but you will not be making the maximum amount of return that way. 

Also 52-week low stocks have risk priced into it already so your downside risk is significantly lower if it is destined to recover in value. 

EDIT: People will tell you that they screen for low-debt stocks or low P/E, P/B... etc stocks. The only problem with those stocks is that the information being screened is incorrect.

In fact i would now wonder why my finance professor said the risk free rate is your true opportunity cost which he alluded as well as myself to the 30 year rate.  Im pretty sure it has to do something with a realistic time horizon and if the government defaults i.e. us currency becomes worthless then so does money? 

I cant recall that was years ago sorry! the short term notes are so low though, its completely odd for anyone to take that low of an interest rate when compared to other options dont you think?

Honestly, i think the risk free rate would be better put as a range of something close to inflation imo because if you cant beat inflation it might be better to consume."

The interest rate risk the other guy was alluding too is kind of wrong b/c if you get the bond at whatever date then you get the bond rate. The rate at the time of analysis should be used as rfr. "

You are right to push back on what I said about the P/E. I misspoke. I should have said that I think it doesn't account for future growth and need to prove that out."
2014-04-12 15:25:06,"There is tons of analysis to do on airlines. Great unit economics information on this industry is available from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/) website. This site should be your best friend for the foreseeable future. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the definitions of the statistics they report. It can be confusing.

I'll push back on whether the trailing P/E of 23.5 account for growth. You have not quantified that. The S&amp;P500's current P/E multiple is about 18 and the current revenue growth rate is 3.6%. The usual no growth rate P/E is somewhere between 7-9x.

While Spirit may be the low cost leader in airlines, there are still structural limitations on how quickly any airline can grow revenue. First there are a limited number of gates they fly out of at any airport. While Spirit can take share away from competitors within markets, and increase their capacity utilization, there is a limit on how many flights they can have per day, thus how many passengers they can accomodate, thus the amount of revenue they can have per market. 

Raising prices is another lever that Spirit can pull to increase revenue. The industry is pretty consolidated and the top 4 US airlines control 70%+ of the domestic revenue passenger miles. [This is the result of over 50 years of mergers.](http://www.historyshots.com/airlines/index.cfm?s=cirk) I've posted alot of articles here about price increases airlines have pushed through stealthily. Most of these increase aren't increases in fare prices. They are adjustments in frequent flyer mile programs or increases in baggage fees, or reduction in services offered. No matter how they try to disguise it, those are all equivalent to price increases.

They can also acquire new gates to expand capacity. They should be able to bid higher than other airlines as their margins are wider, but airport gates are subject to long term leases. These leases can be recaptured if they are underutilized, but I'm unfamiliar with the exact dynamics of that [Here is a report from the FAA on airport competition that you can use to get up to speed.](http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/guidance_letters/media/pgl_04_08b_competition_highlights_2010.pdf) Here's another article about [Virgin Airlines crying to the Feds about how the big airlines are playing dirty with gate access.](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-12/virgin-america-to-merging-airlines-let-us-into-your-hubs) You should definitely study Southwest and their entry into the US market. They were once the low cost leader with small marketshare. Now they have almost 18% of the market. There have been numerous books and case study written on their founding, management style and entry into the US market. 

Regardless, there is a trove of unit economic data you can use to get smart on your thesis. There are also a few airline industry primers in the [primers torrent](http://torcache.net/torrent/562C8EFD9CAFC2AC2CB1588979FD7638C7BDDE84.torrent?title=%5Bkickass.to%5Dinvestment.banking.industry.primers.99.pdfs) you can use to get up to speed.

2014-04-11 18:49:08,"The biggest thing SAVE has going for it is it's an incredibly efficient business model, in just about every way possible. The problem with that is if its efficiency is already priced in--if there's no way to increase margins, you aren't buying value, you're buying fair price. Or you're buying the hope of business expansion--so the question there is if it can expand into more markets than it's already in.

I think a way to really dig into this is to do some research on Ryanair and how it's succeeded and failed in Europe. Spirit is very similar."

They don't discuss *thinking* about investing, but they do expose you to the numbers of specific companies, which is worth something.

2014-04-08 10:41:46,"LOL.  Tell that to an investor when you lose them 60% in a single year.  I know very well that market price is not an intrinsic price, it's how I made all my personal wealth over the last 15 years and I never had a year where I was down more than 6%.  Again there is a difference between absolute returns and risk adjusted returns.

I also didn't do exactly what they do, so it's somewhat apples and oranges.  But in my opinion, it's far more important to add uncorrelated return value and to evaluate returns on a risk adjusted basis."

2014-04-07 22:31:26,"The 30 year rate is usually what is considered the risk free rate, you could also use something comparable to the business project like a 10-15 year i would assume. Using whichever one is a subjective matter.

As for the interest rate risk, sure, but you can also speculate downwards or upwards so when doing an analysis you usually put a date for all your info. As for default risk, the USA's credibility is of the tops, but once again you are right, it is a subjective matter and you can adjust i.e. discount USA's default risk. 

Arbitrage pricing theory might explain this topic more concretely.

2014-04-07 17:09:58,"Honestly, this is one of the most debatable topics out there. The discount rate is suppose to cover the risks of the company in question. 

Theoretically, the truest measure is the opportunity cost, namely the riskfree rate. Thus, the 30 year treasury rate, but a lot of people call bullshit on this and rightfully so. However, the riskfree rate is the start. Then you build on that. 

The top comment states the weighted average cost of capital, but keep in mind that is just the company's estimate of its own projects. 

APT theory goes through a good explanation of what discount rate should cover."
2014-04-07 16:20:23,10%.  but thats my own internal rate of return and i slap it across the board 
2014-04-07 12:34:10,"I use 9% for all my DCF computations.  I do this because, as a baseline, I want to compare investment opportunities against each other and it helps if they all use the same discount rate.  I use 9% because it discounts future cash enough that the ""here and now"" is heavily weighted in my computations vs the future cash flow.  If I got less certain about the future, I'd pick a higher discount rate but what that tends to do is make everything look unattractive.  I doubt I'd go much lower because a dollar in the future just isn't worth a dollar today.

In short, I'm hoping for (expecting) at least a 9% rate of return out of my investments, so that's built into my computations.

In the end, it's a qualitative decision and not a purely quantitative one, so I'm trying to factor out whatever noise I can.

I'm also not managing anyone else's money and my investments are 100% capitalized through my own savings.  I don't borrow money so there's no hurdle for me to jump over."
2014-04-07 03:57:15,"I agree with you, but it's still pretty undeniable that relatively basic rotation schemes can beat extremely sophisticated analysis. Smart people can naturally become obsessed with the sophistication and hence their own intelligence and lose sight of what truly matters.

I'm still learning to understand the financial statements. Reading this document brings up more questions than answers. For instance, under ""CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME"" on page 158, it lists:

total liabilities: $1,674,249 million
total equity:     $206,133 million

That would appear to make their D/E 8.12
whereas Morningstar and FinViz have their D/E listed at 1.1

Which calculation is more accurate?

BTW, Yahoo has it listed as ""N/A"", which I can only interpret as, ""once you get past 1 Trillion in debt, you're too big to fail and we can just stop counting."""
2014-04-06 14:29:48,"As a CFA Charterholder and a person who has worked at 3 hedge funds the answer is:

- It depends.  Each situation is different, each industry is different.  You can't just look at P/B or P/E and use 1 singular approach.  P/B means a lot in the banking industry.  It means absolutely nothing when you are looking at a company like Google.
- The only way to really understand what a company is worth is to literally dedicate years of your life to understanding A) Finance B) Accounting C) Statistics/Economics.  Without a serious understanding of all 3 of those areas, you are just scratching the surface.

That doesn't mean you can't make money like Pabrai and some other guys do with very basic rule of thumb investing (P/B etc.).  But I think they lack the world class sophistication and knowledge of what an economic entity (company, natural resource, etc.) is worth without that knowledge base."

Citigroup is perhaps the worst run bank in the US. The bank came to be from the result of empire building from previous CEOs. The fiasco at Banamex illustrates how management effectively lost control of their institution. So while the bank looks statistically cheap on earnings power it is of very low quality. Compared to Wells Fargo and Bank of America, Citigroup lacks a low source of stable funding which ensures the bank must take on higher risk just to make the same Return on Assets as their competitors."

2014-04-04 17:26:02,"I don't know if this is really a great example case study.  If you look at the 2009 balance sheet, I think there is very little evidence that the outcome would have turned out the way it did.  Just because it wound up being a 3-bagger doesn't mean you were wrong in your initial decision not to buy.  I think it's dangerous to 'learn lessons' from case studies like this; hindsight bias tempts you to learn poor lessons.

The fact of the matter is that Tenneco was in deep trouble in 2009.  It had $1.4B in long term debt and equity that was mostly tied up in illiquid assets (if you think ""current assets"" are a source of liquidity because of its &lt;= 1 year cash conversion cycle definition, think again.  During times of global crisis your inventories and receivables are suddenly harder to cash in on than during economic boons).  Therefore the company was essentially forced to finance its cash obligations in other ways:

1) Since depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses, this served as the predominant source of cash financing.  Essentially the company cut back on expansion, and perhaps even necessary maintenance costs, to fund short-term obligations.  We all know what happens when you skimp on CapEx for a long enough period of time, and if the economy hadn't rebounded the next year they would've dug themselves into an even deeper hole in this regard. 
2) Diluted equity by 25% when its share prices were low.  This is one of the most damaging things you can do to shareholders (you want to REPURCHASE shares when they're valued low, not issue.  We've all heard Buffett's arguments about this)

Essentially what I'm saying is that the company took some desperate measures during desperate times, and they were lucky that the rebound occurred in 2010 and not 2015.  Otherwise they would have kept hemorrhaging cash and financing it in more and more dangerous ways.  Furthermore, they were lucky in that the magnitude of the rebound exceeded the magnitude of cost incurred by foregoing CapEx and diluting shares.  If the rebound were over a slower trajectory, it would have taken a lot longer to dig out of the hole (which, by the way, they're still not out of).  There are several hundreds of companies in which the magnitude of recovery was not sufficient, but we can't reference their prices because they are no longer listed.  This brings my to my next source of bias: survivor bias -- where we focus on the outliers that survived (and their mouth-watering share price rebound) but forget about the fallen companies that weren't as fortunate.

If you had some insight that would have led you to conclude that the rebound would have occurred when it did, and to the magnitude that it did, then sure I would say go ahead and buy.  But your exercise constrained us to being limited to only the information contained in your blog post -- in which case you're forced to conclude that you shouldn't touch the company with a 100-foot pole."

2014-06-03 23:50:12,"The questions that come to my mind:

1) What is a reasonable cap rate for RICK's properties, what are the alternative uses (presumably not restaurants without some decent capex -- no windows?) What would the economics look like to a buyer -- cost, term, availability etc of debt (will drive equity economics), rent escalators, etc?

2) BWLD is a super high growth business (organically), significant franchised component (lower P&amp;L risk), good concept - high unit growth and high ROIC/great unit economics. Need to dig on same statistics for RICK, but I doubt it is a good comp. RICK doing a lot of acquisitions, need to look at organic volume growth and pricing rather than just topline reported. I'm thinking it isn't easy to open a new ""nightclub"" vs opening a new BWLD store, and I'm guessing franchise just isn't possible. If limited organic unit growth, what IRR are they getting on their M&amp;A? Piper Jaffray puts out a good report on restaurant industry with statistics, if you can compile the same data for RICK might help you out in finding best comps.

3) EBITDA a second/third choice for equity valuation, in my opinion. Look at after-tax EBIT, after-tax EBITDA-MCX if D&amp;A not representative. Capex is significantly in excess of depreciation here. What are they investing in, what is the true MCX requirement (restaurants always downplay true MCX and report half-cycle type figures, so need to be careful).

4) With an after-tax unlevered earnings/cash flow yield (atax EBIT yield is about 9%... cash flow appears worse), consider their borrowing costs as a quick benchmark -- just in October sold some 3 year *convertible* debt with a 9% coupon. That is really high. The rest of the debt looks expensive too. Compute a clean equity yield and see how it compares, you need something in excess of that. With high cost debt it might be dilutive.

5) Need to scrub for corporate governance red flags with a company of this size.

2014-06-02 23:00:40,"I was specifically talking about total outsiders. In my experience, funds have to be pretty transparent about positions with investors. There are exceptions, but I think the majority give pretty complete or representative look throughs. It's very common for investors to want pretty detailed information about specific holdings after getting into allocation of capital.

Madoff's investor's troubles wouldn't really have been solved by per-investment look through. That could have been just as cooked."
2014-06-02 22:27:45,"I disagree with their inclusion of R&amp;D costs to maintain multiple versions of the same software. The issue is that these cost savings are only helpful if they're above and beyond what the nearest competitor pays, because otherwise some kind of price competition will occur in the long run.

The biggest question I'd have about any SaaS company is just how high the switching costs are for a given product/service and that's something I have no clue on. That's going to be your ""replacement cost"" and what ultimately drives profitability.

This goes back to Buffett's 12% rule: http://www.tilsonfunds.com/BuffettInflationSwindle.pdf

He basically says this: Over time, firms earn 12% on their equity per year. This is despite world wars, changes in tax rates, and so on. It's a very important concept, because it displays the idea of ""mean reversion."" If a firm is earning too high of a return on its equity, competition should be expected. 

The challenge with a software firm is that the cost to recreate the software is likely greater than what the B/S shows, because it was all expensed. And playing the ""catch up"" game can be more expensive than what was originally spent, or less, but I have no clue on that much technology to really make a statement. (For example - I'm sure it's easier to program a calculator today than it was 20 years ago in many ways)

I bet that if someone knew how to calculate that replacement cost of all the software, the return on ""economic"" capital ends up being closer to that 12% per year that Buffett describes for the economy as a whole. In the long run, that's what should be expected.

I'm not against or for SaaS investments - I'm just saying that I don't think it's anything really special based on what they've described. It will just boil down to how hard the service is to replicate or how expensive it is for a customer to switch, and those might be moving targets, because technology inherently makes things easier, so maybe someone will create alternatives that make switching between companies easier over time.

SaaS firms are likely outside of my ""circle of competence,"" though there are a few I wouldn't mind owning if the price and situation lined up."
2014-06-02 20:00:27,hmm good point. I was just going to see if they would talk to me about a situation with a mortgage servicer and some of its related companies that I wasn't 100% familiar with. And since their portfolios were 20+% of these mortgage servicer and related companies I assumed they had a pretty good idea. Only public info though because many of the financial articles and SEC filings relating to the situation are very confusing to me.

It's standard policy to not talk about positions, strategies, or anything remotely like that with people outside the firm. What incentive do they even have to talk to someone about what and why they are holding something? They spend time that could be spent on work, run the risk of accidentally saying something they shouldn't, and reveal information that their investors paid them well to come up with and keep private.

You mention that you aren't from another firm, so there isn't even the possibility of establishing a new connection or finding someone to work with on anything. So why bother answering your questions?

1.) No financials were excluded in the screen but inherently included in the benchmark. Excluding the most troubled sector over the time period is data mining at its best. 

While I agree that a price to free cash flow to firm is a bad metric for financials, but free cash flow to equity is a perfectly fine measure for financials and should be included. 

2.) Market cap screen is too small compared to the benchmark. While a bias exists in the equal weight index towards smaller companies, the smaller companies in the S&amp;P are at least $4 billion in size where as the screen is $50 million. The smaller companies included are more likely to have better growth opportunities than the S&amp;P companies.

2014-05-29 18:35:45,"Provided you knew for sure that a company was overvalued and there are no tax differences associated with either capital return strategy I can't think of a reason why you would ever return capital to shareholders via a buyback.  Fair value would give you the right return relative to the various forms of risk you are assuming.  Should your company be above fair value, especially if it were demonstrably so, you would certainly not like a buyback.  Ask yourself, would you like them to overpay for a competitor just because it would add to earnings?  In both cases, that would imply a less than fair return for the risks you are taking.

Of course, all of this is too theoretical.  In practice things are not this easy.  For starters, the idea of fair value is a tough one.  Some can peg it some of the time, most can't.  More importantly, ex ante fair value is a probabilistic notion.  A company can be very high reward and high risk (think venture capital).  There is nevertheless still a theoretical fair value.  Now, if the company is overvalued but overcomes these risks you're going to have a big return. It's likely the buybacks will have been highly beneficial to the stockholder (equity holders get large claim on bigger pie).  Ex ante they were still a bad decision.  

For this reason stocks can stay overvalued for a long time.  Moreover, buybacks can cosmetically make it appear as if the business is improving.  Provided you keep earnings flat EPS will grow.  This is not good or bad, but many people who only care about growth and not what it costs to get that growth will tell you buy buy buy.   

What if you knew through your scuttlebutt that this business model was unsustainable.  You don't know how long the good times will last but you know it will end in tears.  Think STRA or SHLD.  These managers were buying back their stock like clockwork.  The operational uplift and the buyback made it so that earnings were growing over 20% per year.  And growth guys were giving these stock big multiples.  Next year management wakes up and they realize big box stores with shitty merchandise or online MBAs were not such a good idea after all.  Ask yourself this, what return did they get on the capital they spent to buyback their stock?  In both cases those investments where more than cut in half.  They would have been better off in t-bills and you would have been better off with a special divy.

2014-05-29 13:02:06,"It depends on their time horizon of investment for the target firm, as well as their belief in the probability of proposed synergies/added value from the merger being realized.

An all-stock purchase splits the risk of synergies not being realized between target/acquiring firm (as well as the up/downside). An all cash purchase leaves all the risk/up + downside to the acquirer. So if it's a solid merger the acquirer would want to pay all cash and target shareholders would want all stock to maximize their respective benefits. 

Cash is usually better than an overvalued asset, but people disagree on value so it depends"

2014-05-27 13:05:47,"When you're analyzing change in NWC for free cash flow to firm/valuation purposes you can exclude cash/cash equivalents, because change in cash is what you're trying to explain.

In their statement of cash flows KO lists their NWC as:
Net change in operating assets and liabilities: 2013 - (932) 2012 - (1,080)

2014-05-26 07:28:33,"The comments on copper prices is essentially speculation. At this stage no-one knows whether the long-term (15+ years) copper price will be higher or lower then currently. The historic long-term declines in copper ore grade have largely been driven by improved technology that has lowered extraction costs, the increasing scale of mines has led to grade dilution, and lets not forget that grades are also a function of prices. If you look historically copper cash costs and prices have generally moved in the same direction with the margin between them staying more or less constant. Changes in cut-off grades through time are a large reason for this constant margin (dropping your cutoff grades during periods of high prices essentially extends your mine life). Currently grades are starting to creep back up in response to the low copper prices as you would expect.

Longer term the average depth of mines should increase. This will place upwards pressure on costs per tonne of ore moved. But it will also just result in mines moving underground and targeting higher grade ore, so really this could go either way in terms of costs per tonne of copper produced.

Generally Antofagasta's projects should be fairly well placed going forward. I haven't looked at their financials recently (only production statistics), so can't really comment on whether the company is fully priced. A solid company though that isn't going anywhere, so could be worth a look into."

- What are their delivery terms
- Do they have quotas? (ie. if they can't produce x they might need to go on spot and buy the difference, which can be either good/bad)
- How predictable/unpredictable is the weather
- What do they actually grow and how much (Monsanto anybody?)
- Equipment and overheads. Do they rent (vs buying) when was the last time they upgraded, patterns in maintenance (ie rising, stable) etc. - this is really ""cost of business"" stuff that can have major anomalies if they're due for a massive upgrade (eg let's buy new GPS tracked self driving tractors, combines and trucks which may not be compatible with our 20 year old tractors...)

- Potential for expansion/subdivision?
- Land sales, land tax(es) licencing/obtaining licences (this refers to the ""sale of land"" part of the business)

The FCF/Rev for Facebook using his numbers is 26% versus 10% for Samsung. Also his FCF Facebook estimate for 2014 is bonkers as FB did almost $1 billion in FCF in the 1st quarter and nobody thinks subsequent quarters are going to generate less (maybe he is factoring in acquisition costs).

2014-07-11 16:16:07,"Escrow services are made much more simple and secure using bitcoin and multi-sig transactions so it would make sense that the cost of all these services the ""greedy banks"" you speak of provide (one of which happens to be my employer) would also decrease. 

Maybe the problem is that you can't see a use for bitcoin in your comfortable middle class American life. I think you may be forgetting that the world is much bigger than just America. In other parts of the world, people are dealing with the headaches (and cost) of currency exchange all the time. If I want to send money back to New Zealand it costs me. Buying bitcoins here and goods (xmas presents etc) with them in New Zealand is genuinely cheaper than buying NZD and transferring it. There are plenty of genuine real-world uses for bitcoin already. As adoption increases, the usefulness of bitcoin will only increase due to the network effect and thus the positive feedback loop continues. "
2014-07-11 15:57:36,"&gt; A benefit to the vendor is a benefit to the consumer eventually as effeciencies are passed on to consumers in order to get a competitive edge.

*Maybe*.  That is a function of the industry.  It is not cut and dry by any means.  More likely is that bitcoin's fees would rise as adoption rises.

Why would they rise?  Simple.  There's a reason for all of the overhead in legacy systems, and it isn't because the legacy systems are full of ""greedy banks.""  Rather, those systems provide security and act as a clearinghouse.  Bitcoin will need both - a mechanism for chargebacks, and a clearinghouse for buyers and sellers when the goods are not exchanged simultaneously with the money.  Otherwise, you're basically sending cash and hoping to get your goods in exchange.

I love the ""bitcoin is like the internet; fiat is like the printing press"" thing.  Fanboys *love* to say that.  It is so far from reality that I laugh a little bit everytime I hear it.  A more apt analogy would be ""bitcoin is like text messaging while fiat is like using e-mail.""  Texting is nifty, but I can already send electronic messages.

On we go to the ""when I need to send money"" meme.  Great - bitcoin as a wealth transmission mechanism.  By all means, if you need to send money to somebody and find bitcoin to be useful in doing so, go ahead.  However, is that really ""changing the world?""  I haven't sent money to anybody in probably 18 months.  When I did, the other user happened to be a JP Morgan customer and I just sent the money with the click of a button (no fee).

99% of the world is paid in a local currency.  Convincing them to convert to bitcoin - and hold it (let's not even get into that) - just doesn't seem realistic.  Sure, you can transfer some money *as needed*, make some internet purchases *as needed,* or some other nifty things *as needed,* but fiat covers the vast majority of needs for the vast majority of people.  It's that simple."
2014-07-11 15:42:37,"A benefit to the vendor is a benefit to the consumer eventually as effeciencies are passed on to consumers in order to get a competitive edge. 

Claiming that fees will increase as adoption increases is pure speculation. Do you have any evidence or past examples or similar occurrences to back up your claims?

Our current fiat currencies may make use of digital technology but they aren't digital currencies. The difference is like the difference between the internet and the printing press. Technically I could write and distribute my own texts prior to the invention of the internet but it was significantly more difficult without access to significant resources. You could say (and people did say) that the internet only gave me advantages in certain niche scenarios too.

Without bitcoin, yes it is possible for me to transfer funds to people and do most of the things I can do with bitcoin. Bitcoin just makes them all so much easier. Let's take an example. Any punter can sit down and write his or her own bitcoin wallet implementation or payment interface whereas only banks can currently create online banking portals. Yes it's true that companies like paypal can create a similar on-line payment utilities but they require the other user to also use paypal or that you pay a fee. With bitcoin I can create my own wallet implementation and you can create yours and they can talk to eachother. If I want a reoccurring payment feature, I implement it, if I want a wallet on my smartphone, I implement it. If you want a fiat payment method on your smart phone, you need to wait for your bank to implement it. "
2014-07-11 15:34:23,"I don't really know much about this stock, but I am interested in the retail food market and go to a lot of different supermarkets and try to see how they compare. I used to be very down on whole foods from a consumer standpoint as having too high prices, but as the general rise in food prices has continued, I now think whole foods compares favorably with every other supermarket from a consumer standpoint in several areas. Their meat department, for example, has higher quality products for the same or less than supermarket chains like kroger or publix. In my area, to get lower price you need to go to ethnic specialty grocery stores that generally have lower standards.  Costco has good quality for slightly less on some cuts."

&gt;In computing, the __Two Generals' Problem__ is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link. It is related to the more general [Byzantine Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Generals)' Problem (though published long before that later generalization) and appears often in introductory classes about [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking) (particularly with regard to the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)), though it can also apply to other types of communication. A key concept in [epistemic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_logic), this problem highlights the importance of [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic\)). Some authors also refer to this as the __Two Armies Problem__ or the __Coordinated Attack Problem__.

2014-07-11 07:44:38,"There is actually a lot that's new about bitcoin. It solves the two generals problem which has up until this point remained an unsolved problem in computer science circles. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals'_Problem

Speaking as a professional software developer in the financial industry, who has also studied CS, (and actually completed my degree, at the top of the class), I would strongly disagree that bitcoin offers nothing from a technical perspective. It is most certainly not 'just another form of electronic money'.

Electronic currency is a good first use for the block-chain proof-of-work/steak technology, but it just the first use. The implications and potential uses for this technology are ground breaking and far reaching in my opinion."
2014-07-10 22:28:36,Thanks!
2014-07-10 20:12:45,"&gt;western union is actually a useful service to send money, and its located all around the world.

Sure, which is why it had millions of dollars of revenue last year.  

However, it's nothing compared to the global currency market, which moves *billions* of electronic representations of *actual* wealth across the world in milliseconds, securely and without issue.  Banks do this consistently, reliably, and for what you probably won't understand as pretty low fees, given the level of competition for service.



Bitcoin is electronic money as well.  Just like all the other electronic money.  

What's bitcoin's big thing again, and how is that different?"
2014-07-10 20:08:41,"&gt; I would just like to point out that transacting with paper money

Stop.  See the mindset here?  Why in the world would you use bitcoin instead of paper money in the first place?  What's the point?  Herein lies the Libertarian dream - ""freedom from a fiat currency that is subject to debasement.""  Bitcoin is arguably more difficult to use than fiat.  You have to whip out your phones, verify transactions, send megabytes (or more) of information across the internet, wait for some block chain to update, *then* you're good.  How's that better than handing over some bills?

It just doesn't make sense, even *if* it does other nifty things (i.e. ""But wait, there's more!"").

On to ""optional payment processors.""  Obviously, somebody needs to step in as a clearinghouse here for the bitcoin community.  No highly transacted commodity (which bitcoin certainly is) lacks one that I can think of.  Clearinghouses *cost*.  That means *fees*.  Which is what will go up the more people demand the sorts of services (clearinghouses and payment processors) that current fiat users enjoy.

So, again:  What's the compelling reason to use bitcoin - as a consumer *who doesn't already own them from when they were a fraction of a penny* - instead of the currency that I'm likely getting paid in?

It just doesn't make much sense.

2014-07-10 16:44:00,"Decentralization is the *most* important feature of Bitcoin?  That's not what a lot of the /r/Bitcoin community thinks but - yes - that's another argument that has been made.

Centralization isn't what contributes to Bitcoin's low fees.  What contributes to low fees is low user acceptance.  Higher fees in any business endeavor come when you have people hooked - it's the death knell for a new technology.  These things go without saying.

However, let's talk about fees.  We pay for *safety*.  We pay for *widespread adoption*.  We pay for *ease of use*.  We pay for *currency translation*.  Unless there's a gun to your head, you and I do this willingly.

Regarding ""resistance to chargebacks,"" you're simply shifting power between parties.  The ability to challenge a transaction gives tremendous power to consumers - something I value as a consumer.  Limiting chargebacks gives power back to retailers.  One is not necessarily ""better"" than the other, but I can assure you that there are far more consumers than retailers out there. 

Further, the ability to challenge a transaction is one of the bigger drivers of credit card use.  Why would I give cash to somebody when there's a chance they could just run with it?  I have literally no recourse.  It's the same with Bitcoin (though to wit, I've seen plenty of whiny kids on /r/Bitcoin complaining about how they lost their bitcoin and asked the community to help them out).  "

I'd love for someone to do a long term study on businesses that have adopted BTC as a method of payment. It'd be good to see just how much economic value (if any) BTC adoption creates. 

There are so many campaigns geared towards getting the good word out, 1 business at a time. Yet, once they accept BTC, the crowds move on. The crowds clamber for BTC acceptance usually because they're sitting on their own pile of it. They're hoping for it to increase in value one day *because* of increased acceptance. So hoarders are convincing shop keeps to accept money that the hoarders will never part with.

2014-07-10 11:18:10,"I often hear these questions - ""have you ever tried to deposit a check in your account form a foreign currency?""  ""Have you ever used Western Union?""

The answer for me - and, literally, *for most people* - is NO.  In what situation would I be accepting checks from foreign countries?  In what situation are YOU accepting checks from foreign countries?  I write about 10 checks a year, mostly to the people who are still stuck in the stone age and haven't figure out anything better (i.e. government agencies).

As for Western Union, it's already a dying business.  Their revenues have barely budged over 5 years.  It exists to service mostly the world of grey-market money transactions - for example, illegal immigrants sending money home.  I think I covered that part of Bitcoin's appeal (""great for criminal activity"").

Again, I have heard these arguments again and again - the niche type that goes along the lines of ""but what if you had a purple unicorn and the existing monetary system was unable to accommodate it?""  Hardly the sort of thing that least to mass uptake, IMHO."
2014-07-10 10:57:52,"I think the main draws to bitcoin could be huge. It seems to me that the traditional system is far from awesome and designed at a time when the internet wasn't a factor. Sending money digitally right now is far from ideal, have you ever used western union or tried to deposit a check in your account from a foreign currency. Its not the most pleasant experience. I don't know if bitcoin will end up being a big part of our economy but I do have to think that money transactions are ripe for some major innovation."
2014-07-10 10:10:51,"Who are these ""people?""  Was it four or five talking heads who were making wild and totally unsubstantiated prognostications on the future?

I was using ""the internet"" way back before Mosaic even came out - when you had a 2400 baud modem and needed a phone line to dial in.  The use of the system was immediately obvious at the time, and only got better.

Bitcoin is electronic money.  Except for some mechanics - none of which are groundbreaking - there is *nothing* new about it.  We know how to send money to a remote location in a secure fashion.  If we so chose, we could do it for free.  Electronic money is ubiquitous already - your Visa credit card is essentially a payment system that you can use in practically any developed nation in the world, instantaneously taking care of both security issues as well as local currency translation.  To the user, it's seamless.

Bitcoin is difficult to use.  I studied CS in college and still program regularly; nobody would call me technically inept.  I played around with Bitcoin and found it to be mind-numbingly technical and far from intuitive.  There is nothing about bitcoin that makes it immediately and obviously superior to any other form of electronic transmission of currency already out there.

What are bitcoin's *real* draws?  Well, it's a Libertarian's wet dream for one.  The ""dang gubmints printing money and debasing my currency"" crowd *loves* the idea of bitcoin.  It's great for criminal activity - the anonymous electronic transmission of money for illicit goods or services.  It's good for people who don't want to pay fees and don't mind being outside of the system.

Bitcoin, being just another form of electronic money, will probably stick around.  I don't doubt that the technologies embedded in the protocol will be picked up by other payment systems.  However, I simply do not see it as a ""game changing innovation"" that will significantly displace legacy systems."

2014-07-08 07:48:22,"I don't know how others are doing it (or academics for that matter), but this is how I think about it:

I determine what the company is yielding for the current price (FCF / earning, whatever is relevant) then look at the growth prospects. If the company is yielding 5% and when you look at growth prospects / past growth you can make some conclusions.

If the company is yielding 5% and growing fast (15%+ p.a), market is either mispricing it or expecting that growth will slow down in the near future.

If the company is yielding 5% and growing slow (2-5%), market is expecting growth to be slow, but steady. (You see most blue-chips here, like KO)

If the company is yielding over 10%+ or so, market is expecting growth will decline or be non-existent.

If the company is yielding 3% or less, market is expecting really high growth. (Or that the earnings are ""guaranteed"" so that it justifies so small yield)

I also determine whether growth is sufficient for me by thinking how many years of such growth it would take for the yield to become enough for me, for example if a company yields 1% FCF and grows 30% p.a, the company would have to grow at such pace for a bit over 9 YEARS for the yield to get over 10% for that particular company.

That kind of expectations would be too much for me, even though the growth looks pretty nice.

This of course doesn't tell you anything how the stock will appreciate, but you can't know about that anyway.

This is of course really simplified way too look at it, but I guess you could use this more as a framework. I guess my point is, why make things more complicated than necessary?"

2014-07-07 00:27:34,"Beren-'s links should be the starting point for valuing the equity. 
That being said, I'd look at the company's business to see why it is distressed. A business in secular decline is very different from a good business whose management made bad financing choices. I'd look at EBITDA multiples and free cash flow to firm forms of DCF for valuation. Equity based valuation methods won't necessarily be helpful. If they are truly distressed, debt service will wipe out most of their net income/FCFE. 

Without knowing anything else, the people holding the largest tranche of debt should be watched. They are covered in positive scenarios (by the upside implied by the warrants) and negative scenarios as well (by recovery/the option to convert debt to equity if they are the fulcrum security)."

This is partly due to the fact that it is in Dallas and not NYC. All proceeds from the event go to The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and The Vickery Meadow Youth Development Foundation (a local Dallas charity) so the vast majority of your ticket price/donation is tax deductible. Hors d'oeuvre and Cocktails at the reception afterward are great as well.

It's coming up soon this year, Oct. 7th, the speakers are:

I had access to Bloomberg Terminals and Factset at my college, I built my screens and exported them into my models for further analysis... Really solid model in my opinion, basically deep value metrics analyzed quantitatively to eliminate behavioral biases.

Now I no longer have access to these data sources :("
2014-09-10 00:45:52,"We had to build our own as there are no screeners we could find that allow you to customize the formulas used to filter the stocks.

We have found spreadsheet templates and plugins that do a decent job downloading up to date data to do custom analysis on a stock in Excel. Unfortunately, this is one stock at a time.

With approximately 5,000 stocks to comb through listed with the 3 major US exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX). If it took only 5 minutes to go through each stock, gathering the data to filter on Value Investing parameters, that would be 25,000 minutes or 417 hours. Financial data changes every quarter, price changes daily.

Some services to look at:

* jivedata (https://www.jivedata.com) looks interesting and cost effective. They have a spreadsheet plugin, but their data does not go back 10 years yet as it is based on parsing XBRL.

* I have not used Bloomberg, CapIQ, FactSet, etc, but it appears that they have the data and great Excel templates and plugins. The cost of these services is prohibitive.

* Old School Value (http://www.oldschoolvalue.com) looks good too. They have spreadsheet templates and prebuilt screens. Here is one that uses the Graham formula you mentioned above: http://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-screener/ben-graham-formula-stock-screen.php.

* YCharts (https://ycharts.com) allows you to customize the filters somewhat, but that service is $3,600/yr.

Hope that helps.

Best of luck!

2014-09-04 20:35:58,"A great interview, and it's got me thinking. I know this isn't the right sub for macro, but...

In '99 the bubble was hyping a new tech paradigm. In 2008 the bubble was hyping a new credit paradigm. What if in 2014 (or '15 or maybe '16) the bubble will be a new investing paradigm--namely, indexing.

If a lot of retail money flows into index ETFs that buy and hold a bundle of stocks tied to indices (regardless of their value by any metric outside the index), could we see valuations go higher and higher as capital flows in, until a tipping point where people say it's too pricey and stop buying? In such a scenario, wouldn't we see a sudden decline in volumes just before the crash? The aftermath would be interesting--a bunch of Boglehead types married to buy and hold would suddenly be tempted to cut losses and sell on a correction.

I'm kinda thinking out loud here--I'd love any thoughts on indexing as a macro risk factor."

2014-09-04 14:49:47,"They put all that stuff out there because they need a legitimate non-tax business purpose for the IRS and the courts to honor their tax-motivated maneuver.  Otherwise, the IRS can refuse to acknowledge their corporate structure for tax purposes.  When billions are on the line, they need their justifications to be as numerous and thorough as possible to absolutely ensure that the structure will be honored.

It seems like everyone is aware at this point that the U.S. Tax Code and its general approach to taxation is backwards and outdated.  Corporation after corporation has seized the opportunity to leave the country and establish a different domicile, and the inversion transactions are the latest innovation for corporations to do just that.  Burger King probably had its eyes on Tim Horton's for business reasons, but the timing is no coincidence.  The tax benefits may well have been the difference between a deal and no deal."
2014-09-04 09:47:47,"That assumes we fully believe their asset valuations and that they have similar earnings power. Few questions:

1. Why are you comfortable with the asset values they have reported? Looking back at bank balance sheets in 2006/2007, was either of these suspicious?

2. Are they actually in similar business lines or different?

3. What about capital allocation? Who repurchases shares, and who does it more wisely?

4. Who is more likely to screw up, and if that happens, how will it happen?"

This you will need to scour the annual report for. Graham wanted to know the general discounted liquidation value of the firm. Also you should realize that Grahams criteria of selection was written over 40 years ago, as such some of the values should be boosted to accommodate at least for inflation. EG if he stated $500M in sales, you should not consider this a minimum value metric at face value, since the dollar value of that figure was written in the 70's. Adjust all your metrics accordingly. Also ignore prepaid expenses always when using ratios, or other expenses which are non-recoverable as they are no longer assets generally when liquidation occurs. We want the deep value of the company. 


For tangible BV you can simply take out goodwill, intangibles and other obligations, along with total liabilities from Total Assets to get TBV. Did RS pass all? Possibly not the final test you conducted, but again you must realize that finding deep value stocks in present markets is extremely difficult due to the markets doing very well, and because things have changed since Grahams time. That being said I would say you have found a healthy company for the most part, but the next step is to scour the annual reports to find any footnotes which may be glaringly deterring from purchasing the company. Decent job so far, but I would maybe take a look at some of my other posts in my history on deep value stocks. Additionally, consider the post on investing cash flow within this thread and investigate. Also to help you perform screening of companies easier, check out portfolio123, register a trial account and input grahams criteria to screen for potentially better opportunities as well. If you need further help valuing the company, I could help along the way. 

Also consider grahams formula for valuing share price of a company. This is EPS diluted * (8.5*10) *4.4/(risk free rate/100) 

The 8.5 is a basic PE ratio that graham utilized, and the 10 is really just 5% growth times 2 to adjust for future growth. 4.4 is grahams required rate of return. So according to Grahams formula, the stock should be valued at around $80 per share. Cheers

There are two segments:
* Seed &amp; Genomics - which I classed as Biotechnology
* Agricultural Productivity - which I HAD classed as Chemical (speciality), i've since changed it to Farming/Agriculture and it seems to have corrected the problem.

We were provided with a list of industries their respective Equity betas, D/E ratios, and tax rates.

So to calculate the bottom-up beta I:
* Unlevered the equity betas for each industry using their respective D/E ratios and tax rates
* Took their weighted average based on the contributions each segment makes to Monsanto's earnings
* Relevered the beta with Monsanto's D/E ratio.

I have question regarding the last point... When re-levering the beta, I assume I should use the tax rate corresponding with Monsanto (i've chosen the u.s. marginal corporate tax rate - is this correct?

"
2014-10-16 09:06:00,"Pro is def. worth paying up for in my opinion. The high level thesis from the article:

Operating in a niche industry providing small orders (less than $2.5K) for physical foreign currency in specific denominations, Currency Exchange is a focused operator beginning to achieve scale and associated operational leverage. The company is both well capitalized for future growth and increasing liquidity which should attract institutional investors in United States and Canada to the name. Furthermore, a near-term hard catalyst is on the horizon as CXI wraps up its process and approval in becoming a Canadian banker's bank. Once transitioning to a banker's banks, margins will expand by 15% (currently not reflected in market valuation).

Currency Exchange is trading at less than 20x net income pre-banker's bank catalyst and less than 7x fiscal 2015 EBITDA/~10x FY2014 run-rate EBITDA (note: we do not deduct cash from EV for CXI, in this case would represent ~$32MM in incremental value/ or 40% of the current market capitalization). Recently Travelex just sold for ~25x to 30x net income and 13x EBITDA. These levels of valuation also justify the $23 to $25 price target.

A position in Currency Exchange is merited by the following attributes:

Competitive Position
Currency Exchange is the third largest participant in its niche and is the only non-bank participant, hence it has experienced significant tailwinds in capturing new business (generally regional and local banks).
CXI has a differentiated and superior technology offering, partially due to their focus exclusively on currency solutions vis-à-vis peers such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).
Focused non-competitive partner of local banks. Regional banks do not want their private data going to rivals such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo who may attempt to compete with profitable branch locations as much as possible.

2. Favorable Industry Dynamics with Strong Returns on Capital and Re-investment Opportunities

Foreign currency procurement is a low capital intensity, recurring revenue service business.
Due to the asset-light nature of the business, CXI has consistently generated returns on capital in excess of 15%, even when including one-time costs.
Inventory carries low risk (inventory currency hedged daily).
Although a niche field, private equity and financial services conglomerates have been attracted to this field.
Competitors infrequently compete significantly on price as a way to win new business.

The wholesale currency exchange logistics business carries significant barriers to entry for both large banks and new competitors. This is partially due to the ""network"" effect and infrastructure needed.

3. Attractive Valuation

Impressive margin profile, with EBITDA margins in excess of 25%.
The company currently trades at ~10x 2014E EBITDA (EV not deducting $32MM in cash) &amp; is worth at least 13x given organic growth and precedent transactions.
CXI is a cash flowing business unlikely to need additional equity capital in the short and intermediate term.
Precedent transactions have occurred anywhere from 12.5x to 36.5x EBITDA, with the low end slated towards retail providers. Given CXI's asset-light business model, low CapEx needs and embedded sales base, at minimum CXI would demand a 15x EBITDA multiple in the private markets, which would amount to a ~$20 share price excluding a true up, which would be in line with our upside case.

4. Steady &amp; Consistent Cash Flow Model

Once the current business ramps up EBITDA above $10MM to $20MM, CXI will be able to take on conservative amount of leverage. While we do not model such a scenario in our valuation section, we believe a dividend recapitalization when appropriate could accelerate the realization of value.
EBITDA to OCF conversion is one of the highest we've seen, with a ~95% or higher conversion rate. Hence, EBITDA rapidly falls down to the bottom line and is not caught up in maintenance capex.

5. Operating Leverage

With 4 vaults including a 5x increase in vault operations staff, a scalable platform, and a growing cadre of banks working through the sales pipeline, CXI is poised to begin earning new client revenue which will increasingly fall to the bottom line.
Foreign currency funding costs will decrease 15% to 20% once the banking charter is approved (we believe late Q4 to Q1 2015) as CXI will have the ability to go to the US Federal Reserve banks and the Bank of Canada for currency instead of a large bank acting in a wholesale capacity.

Becoming a banker's bank will allow CXI to sign large banking clients in both the US and Canada which have been hesitant (compliance etc.) given CXI's money service business regulatory status.

6. Experienced Management Team and Owner-Operator

Management is well-versed in the business and aligned with shareholders.
Founder and CEO Randolph Pinna owns 25% of the business and is thusly highly incentivized to maximize shareholder return.
Mr. Pinna started the predecessor business (Foreign Currency Exchange- now owned by Wells Fargo) in 1987, sold FCE to the Bank of Ireland in 2003, and led the carve-out of what would become CXI in 2007."

2014-10-15 23:56:06,How are you calculating bottom-up beta? Unlevered beta should always be lower than levered beta - just given the levering/unlevering formula it's impossible to have levered beta lower than unlevered beta except in the odd situation where equity is negative and debt is greater than $0.
2014-10-15 23:22:13,"&gt; I've been holding around 90% cash for most of the year

Normally there'd be no shortage of people calling you an idiot  :)"
2014-10-15 22:55:39,"&gt;I read somewhere that a more leveraged firm may indicate less volatility because of tax advantages associated with debt - is this true?

No, leverage increases volatility of the cash flows to equity holders.  The more debt a firm carries, the more volatile are the residual cash flows to equity holders.  This required return to equity holders must increase to compensate for the risk (i.e., a higher levered beta).  Ignoring theory for a second and practically speaking, you would need a higher expected return to invest in the equity of a company with more debt than less debt since the debt makes the equity more risky (dividends come after interest payments).

&gt;Regarding the cost of equity and WACC, the values are both slightly lower for the bottom-up beta. Is this due to the lower level of risk?

Something looks wrong with your levered bottom-up beta as it shouldn't be lower than the unlevered bottom-up beta.

When you say ""bottom-up beta"", are you talking about taking industry betas for operating segments in different businesses?  If so, the difference between your regression beta and your bottom up betas would probably be due to your choice of peer companies and the measurement period you selected.  Regressing beta should give you an unbiased estimate but it is still only an estimate and you are trying to measure a variable that is not stationary. 

&gt;Another note i'm not so sure on. So the regression beta uses historical prices and is unlevered using recent debt/equity values. If the capital structure of the company is changing over time (likely if i'm estimating 2009-present), should this bias the beta estimate?

Yes, it the capital structure changed during the measurement period, then that is going to bias the beta estimate.  In theory, investors would update their estimate of their required return based on changing capital structure expectations and rediscount expected cash flows.  If you measure beta over a period when the capital structure changed and then unlever it using a single d/e ratio, you are going to have a biased estimate.

You would expect the beta estimates from both methods to be a bit different and it's probably more important to understand the likely source of the discrepancies."

2014-10-15 18:40:15,"Opinions are like assholes - everyone's got one, and most of them stink.  And in both cases, mine is worse than the average.

Spreads on low quality credit suggest that we're still in a 'rising risk' environment, and I can't convince myself that anything these past two or three weeks is going to change that.  A lot of 'momentum' stocks have hopped to declining risk - but they still look a little bubbly and rich to me.  Historically, most large cap equities look about right - maybe even a hair undervalued by PEGY/PE.  But Market Capitalization to GDP still looks ridiculously high.

This week has been crazy inside of financial institutions and amongst market watchers...but I really don't think it's 'pierced the veil' of the average citizen, at least in the US.  It's funny - most 'average' non-financial folks don't know what the interest rate on their bank account is, much less what the S&amp;P returned last year.  My gut says there's still more greed out there than caution, and unless we saw **another** 10% drawdown on the S&amp;P 500 I don't think you'd see it tipover.

I still think we're in an expansion economically in the US, and despite the concern about Europe and China (which has been there for 3 or 4 years anyway) I'm still bullish.  Which means everyone should probably sell and run for the exits.

TL;DR - everyone still looks greedy, nobody looks terribly fearful, so we're still on an 'up-risk' cycle and I think we'll stay there (probably rightfully) for at least another couple of years."

2014-10-15 13:44:53,"Going to disagree with nearly everyone in this thread. I always subtract acquisitions for free cash flow calculations, along with capex, because like capex, acquisitions are a real cash charge (unlike D&amp;A, which you add back) that need to be accounted for.

Several posters here talking about maintenance vs. growth capex. In reality, unless the company actually breaks down their capex into maintenance and growth spending in the 10K, it's nearly impossible to ascertain which spending was for which. IMO it's best to assume (unless the company explicitly states otherwise) ALL capex is maintenance capex. This way you build in a margin of safety: if you overestimated capex, great, the value will be greater than what you estimated it to be, thus greater upside. If using all capex (instead of a lesser amount) turns out to be accurate, then hey, your model was correct and no nasty surprises. 

But to answer your question, yes I'd use the average capex/acquisitions over whatever period you have available. Or if you've forecasted sales for next year already, use the historical average of capex/sales to revenue and adjust accordingly."

2014-10-15 09:39:25,"I would think of it this way.

What if you owned the entire business.  You bought it 3 years ago, earnings have now doubled.  You bring in an appraiser, and he tells you the value of the business is the same as you paid 3 years ago.

Have you made any money?  It depends.

You have had 3 years of earnings.  Did you take the earnings out of the company and put them in your pocket.  If so, then yes, you made money.  On the other hand, you might have reinvested the earnings back into the business.

Do you need to sell the business today?  If you reinvested all the profits back into the business and you have to sell today for the same price you paid 3 years ago, then, no, you haven't made anything.  Why?  It may be that you overpaid for the business 3 years ago (think Cisco circa early 2000s where the stock was down 80% over a 3 year period while earnings went way up)

If you don't have to sell, then you can continue to own the business and continue to continue to decide what to do with the profits.  If the business continues to be profitable and to grow, you can own it indefinitely.  The temporary view of an appraiser doesn't matter.

Owning the stock instead of the entire business is pretty much the same, except that you don't control how the profits of the business are used.  If earnings have doubled and the stock price hasn't moved, maybe you overpaid.  If you don't need cash today, you can continue to hold the stock.  Whether it makes sense to do so depends on your view of the businesses prospects and whether you trust management to do the right things with the profits.  It is possible for an undervalued stock to double earnings and for the stock to be unchanged 3 years later, but in 20+ years of being in and around the markets, I haven't seen it happen yet."

Every major oil company is going to be getting cheap crude oil, but the price they will get from consumers will be dropped too.

I really think the major sources of value are going to come from whichever major oil company strategically gets good contracts of crude oil price in this time of fluctuation and convenience store sales. 

I really think the assumption of cheaper crude oil prices is going to be washed away from lowered prices received from the market esp since everyone is going to be reducing prices. Lowered prices is only going to he great for the consumer and companies that can sell high volume. "
2014-10-15 01:17:13,"I'd take a look at PBF energy too. They're a refinery and they have been really beaten up since the Obama administration decided certain very light sweet crudes could be treated as refined products. They're also being beating up as the brent-wti spread collapses on weak European (general non-US) demand relative to the US.

They currently have a 5.3% dividend yield."
2014-10-15 01:02:27,"Right, gas stations actually barely make any money off of retail sales of gas. The refinery business maybe a lot different. The convenience store sales is where the money is made. BP would have the edge imo with the convenience store sales. Their whole marketing scheme of ""too much good stuff"" is a lot different from other gas companies that promote ""technologically"" advanced gasoline like chevron or shell.

Given these qualitative aspects, i was saying that if i had to pick one of the major oil companies to fundamentally analyze then i would first look at BP."
2014-10-15 00:53:32,Sometimes there are circumstances under which the asset is not earning it's reasonable estimate of cash flows. In this case the NAV acts as a floor to value it.

2014-10-15 00:31:30,"I'm not all the way caught up, and you seriously need to be in this kind of cyclical group.

What really surprises me is the amount of shale oil around the world the is untapped. Regardless of whether it is being produced... its there. 

Pemex is looking to start fracking in their region, and unsurprisingly there is a huge reserve. While there is a lot of supply there is potential for even more supply. Scary stuff."
2014-10-15 00:27:46,"There's no doubt in my mind that there's probably some gold to find.  For example, Munger's excise the bad business segment approach might uncover some real gems.

*HOWEVER*... Unless you know or can get up to speed with the whole supply/demand dynamics of the oil industry, including the potential and realized effects of shale gas/shale oil, I would stay away.  You'd be speculating otherwise.

Note, I *do* think one can get up to speed with the industry (subsea basins, fracking, potential arctic reserves, the issue with Ukraine/Russia/Gasprom/etc., the dynamics of OPEC, etc.), but this would take at least four months of dedicated study.

I'm guessing there are lower hurdles to jump..."

2014-10-14 22:57:59,"IIRC, these companies main value comes from the assets. Different companies need to be evaluated in different ways. For example, if a company has gold then the market value of that gold holds all of its value. The gold doesnt really produce a return like a operating business thus the assets are the key valuation. You could basically say its the terminal value thats worth the most. 

The tricky part is trying to find the market value of these assets since they are booked at cost which could be good or bad. "
2014-10-14 22:45:04,"If prices get that cheap, then i would expect the company to issue a special dividend or buy back shares to realize value. Eventually if the market still ignores it, it could even do a buy out and erase itself from being a public company. 

If the company doesnt do any of those actions then i highly doubt those doubled earnings are legit."

IRRs are at more than 200%, on $4M well costs, when now they are only 2.5M Oil projected price was $100, but even with $80 oil, the economics are fantastic. This is only one part of their acreage as well, they have lots of other plays. PV-10 of this alone is over $400M, and ascribes literally no value to the rest of  the acreage."

2014-10-14 19:27:46,"That doesn't make sense when you consider what makes up a stock's price: P/E ratio * EPS

So if earnings doubled, it is likely the share price would have doubled unless new shares were issued (reducing EPS) or there was multiple contraction (P/E ratio decreased).

If you assume that the company is so hated that it trades at a 90% discount to peers, the increase in earnings will inevitably lead to a higher price regardless of the continued discount."
2014-10-14 18:04:15,"You're saying yourself that the share price has not moved up. I'm assuming that is what you mean by ""hated by the market"". So, no, you wouldn't have made money on the share price. Like radde said though, maybe via dividends.  

There's always ways to make money even if the market hates it though, like if the market hates it but it gets bought out for a higher price than you've paid... "

2014-10-13 21:59:11,"If the firm made a bad acquisition in the past and it has reduced the forward operating profitability of the combined entity, then that would already be in the forward projections.  Wouldn't it?  If it's a single bad transaction, why assume that it will continue to do that forever in future deals?

To assume they will always do shit deals and constantly impair the forward equity/enterprise value by misappropriating capital, is a bit extreme.  You would have to have a *very good reason* to make that justification.  I have done it in one case in an activist role where I was trying to throw out the CEO (and some of his family members which were all on the payroll) and/or force a sale of the company to a competitor.  I was trying to show how this CEO perpetually destroyed value year after year and if he continued to do this sort of thing, it would ultimately loot shareholders of $X M dollars.  Keep in mind, my argument was for my firm's position and I was in an adversarial position vs. management.  It was ultimately sold to a competitor and he went on to greener pastures (golf/retirement)."
2014-10-13 21:53:48,"So if a firm acquires a crappy company that reduces their operational profit, you would remove it?

2014-10-13 12:05:24,I agree with this guy. You have to figure out what Monsanto acquired and why it did so to ascertain whether it was maintenance or growth capex.

2014-10-13 11:46:45,"I dislike analysis with lines like: 
&gt; My guess is a *lot* more than the current price.

But the initial component was a nice review of spectrum."
2014-10-13 11:06:38,"Answer is it depends.  In actuality, you should value the operations (cash flow) that the entity produces.  You should subtract out the capex required to grow and sustain (maintenance) the existing operations (as it stands today).  New acquisitions should *change* the operational forecast (cash flows) and should be considered separately.  I would not include them.

There are a few exceptions to this thought process and one is where a company needs to constantly acquire key technology to maintain their existing franchise.  An example of this might be Cisco Systems, which has a very large install base and over the years has made piecemeal acquisitions to augment their portfolio of products/services.  Facebook's recent acquisition of whatsapp is seen as a defensive, investment in its existing franchise -- not something that will seriously augment the existing revenue/cash flow picture.  In that case, it might be wise to constantly assume that some level of spend must take place to acquire businesses -- because in reality, they are supplementing their R&amp;D expense in the income statement (through acquisitions in the cash flow investing section).

&gt;Oil-sands producers facing pipeline bottlenecks have helped narrow a price discount for Canadian heavy crude relative to the main U.S. benchmark to $12.85 a barrel today(!!!), from a record of $42.50 in late 2012, by turning to trains.

Anyways, to respond to your other points, 

&gt;As long as the price of crude is above $x/bbl.

Yeah... That's how most drillers stay profitable...? Once again, tight oil drillers are about the marginal producers right now, so they'd be first to stop production, not the sands. 

&gt;So they found a geologist to certify the project cost as $x. That don't make it so! Give me $50k and I'll find you a geologist who says it can be done for $30/bbl!

[""An examination of 50 plays in Canada and the U.S. shows that, on average, Canadian oil plays can generate decent returns at a cheaper benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil price than those in the U.S., analyst Patricia Mohr says in the latest Scotiabank commodity report.""](http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Canadian+beats+costs+bank+study+says/9545692/story.html)

So at least it seems relatively empirical. Now as for the assumptions made by the individual plays, well what can I do about that? I'm not a geologist.

&gt;As in steam flood? Gimme a call in 20 years.

From their investor presentation:

Conklin S. Athabasca Mining / In-situ 608 584 948 1,036 1,036

Henday N. Athabasca Mining / In-situ - - 1,120 1,698 1,698 1,698

In-situ's already a thing. 

&gt;Specific examples, please.

Spread is already 12.50, on the back of rail alone. Yeah pipelines will take a long while, but they'll get there.

&gt;Never going to happen. Moving liquid across half a continent on land plus a full ocean is too expensive. Also NIMBYism.

http://www.theodora.com/pipelines/united_states_pipelines_map.jpg

There's already a ton of pipelines crisscrossing the US. If it weren't profitable to move oil that far, they wouldn't exist. 

&gt;That is delivered to refineries 3000 miles away from the bulk of Civeo's operations in Alberta. Different rules, buddy.

Once again, from RAIL, the spread's dropped to 12.50. Rail is obviously a lot more expensive than pipeline.

&gt;Try enforcing this if your customers are circling the drain.

Their customers include EOG, Imperial Oil, ConocoPhillips, Devon, Fluor, etc. Not exactly the next biotech companies here.

&gt;Do you have numbers on this? Would be very interesting.

Sadly no, I just looked through their SEC and shareholder presentations.

&gt;The key number here is the unpublished delta between the $min_to_keep_the_roof_from_caving_in_during_the_cold_harsh_north_Canadian_winter and the actual capex budget. This is a different number for this year than five years from now.

I don't have numbers for that but I assume they're not stupid enough to let the buildings rot. 

&gt;Again, I haven't followed the stock closely, so can you point me to this proposed loan, or at least the lender? Thanks.

From their 10-Q

Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt. We historically relied on Oil States for financial support and cash management. Following the Spin-Off, our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed. In conjunction with the Spin-Off, on May 28, 2014, we entered into (i) a $650.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility which is allocated as follows: (A) a $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Civeo, as borrower, (B) a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of certain of our Canadian subsidiaries, as borrowers, and (C) a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of one of our Australian subsidiaries, as borrower, and (ii) a $775.0 million, 5-year term loan facility in favor of Civeo (collectively, the Credit Agreement). U.S. Dollar amounts outstanding under the credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.75%, or a base rate plus 0.75% to 1.75%, in each case based on a ratio of our total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). Canadian Dollar amounts outstanding under the credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to CDOR plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.75%, or a base rate plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.75%, in each case based on a ratio of our total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). Australian Dollar amounts outstanding under the credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to BBSY plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.75%, based on a ratio of our total leverage to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). We paid certain customary fees with respect to the Credit Agreement. We have 15 lenders in our Credit Agreement with commitments ranging from $20 million to $195 million.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to consolidated interest expense. of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and our maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 3.5 to 1.0.  Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Credit Agreement.  EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined, exclude goodwill impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges.   We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants during the remainder of 2014. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our significant subsidiaries."

2014-10-12 15:16:42,"As per my comment it wasn't necessarily OCW vs NSM but because I own NRZ and feel it to be extremely undervalued.  The company is fed MSRs and distressed debt from NSM and LEAF.  That's what led me to both companies.  NSM is extremely leveraged, but they can securitize away the risks and free up capital.  

LEAF is probably the better investment, especially if they buy Citigroup's subprime division.  "
2014-10-12 15:01:19,"From the little research I've done into these companies and barring Lawsky getting his way with this lawsuit, Ocwen seems a lot better in most ways. They have much better cost structure, a good capital allocator at the helm, lowest leverage, good technology and they have less aggressive accounting since they book their MSR portfolio at cost and they only recognize fees earned on delinquent loans until all the payments have been received from the borrower.

What are your main reasons for wanting to go with Nationstar and not Ocwen?"
2014-10-12 14:19:07,"Auction Risk: I'm pretty sure NSM and WAC have relatively small subprime portfolios but they OCN specializes in subprime so that makes up a huge portion of their portfolio.

Cost Structure: Ocwen just has the lowest costs because they have the lowest tax rate (Virgin Islands) and they outsource all of their servicing platforms to Portugal, India, etc. Idk why NSM and WAC don't do it. Maybe its just too big of a one time expense to outsource it to different countries. 

Final Question: I think these yields will continue into 2018 as banks continue to get subprime MSRs off their books and by then Ocwen will probably have created/acquired some entity to originate a ton of Subrpime loans. Bill Erbey keeps talking about some sort of big acquisition. I hope its Quicken Loans."
2014-10-12 01:22:12,"Thanks for the post.  Out of curiosity, how close to you watch NSM? I have been following Fortress Investment Group (FIG) and am invested in them and their two REITS, NCT &amp; NRZ.  I know NRZ gets fed a lot of MSRs and other securitized loans from NSM.  Just wondering what your thought process was on it.

If I am not mistaken, NSM is going to spin off their REO assets like OCW did with Alitsource.

2014-10-11 19:10:13,"Alright, at computer. First off, you're right, the most important question is where the producers that rent from Civeo sit on the cost curve. The answer is once again, [lower than](http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/coking1.png) [you think](http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2014/02/fp0221_oilpatchcosts_c_jr1.jpeg). 

Civeo's Australian lodges mainly deal with met coal, and as you can see, those operations almost UNIFORMLY sit on the bottom half of the cost curve. The coal shutdowns and whatnot are all from unprofitable US operations. If nothing else, analysts at least forecast that it [won't get](http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/government-predicts-pain-to-continue-for-iron-ore) [any worse](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/25/australia-resources-idUKL4N0P54VZ20140625).

For oil, once again, as you can see, oils sands are typically thought of as extremely pricey, and they do require absolutely massive amounts of capital investment, but those places will be producing for generations. Once you take that into account, the breakeven price is pretty damn low, compared to most other unconventionals. One concern I do have is most of the projects Civeo is providing for are mining instead of in-situ, however, existing mining projects have a breakeven of $60! Future growth will have to come from in-situ, which I swear I remember reading had lower employee requirements.

As for the REIT question, I already knew what REITs were and etc was already totally convinced by the management's presentation. I was just wondering if you had any more information past what management gave.

As for contracts structure from the shareholder presentation:

Typical contract structure

−Majority of contracts have termination provisions but customers incur a material termination fee

− Terms most often range of up to two to five years

− Occupied rate which includes room, meals and ancillary services

− Unoccupied rate

− Minimum occupancy requirement

− Annual contractual escalation provisions to cover increases in labor and consumables costs over the contract term

Maintanance capex is also only $50-60M a year(presentation), and the facilities aren't 5 star hotels but they're servicable, and people aren't going there for vacation, they're going to work. For work camps and lodges, they look pretty damn good to me.

Best of all, you get paid 4% just to wait!

Edit: Just read some more, specifically the 2015 outlook. That does seem bad, and I don't like where it's headed. Otoh, even if something drastic(like right now jesus it's like 2008 almost) happened, Civeo has the liquidity to weather the storm."

2014-10-11 16:30:21,"The major change in bank business models in the last 40 years has been the shift from a return on assets model (loans on bank balance sheet) to a return on equity (loans on some LP's BS, bank takes origination and monitoring fees)."
2014-10-11 16:22:15,"Civeo operates no-frills hotels in the middle of nowhere for the natural resource industries.  Here are some pictures [[0]](http://civeo.com/lodges-villages/canada/mariana-lake-lodge/).  Now I don't know what the oilfield economics are for the company's clients, but Canadian oil sands generally have a higher per barrel cost relative to say, TX, CA, LA, or even Colorado.  First they have to get the oil out of the ground, then process it, then get it to market (which gets expensive if you don't have a pipeline nearby), then the refinery pays them a huge discount to WTI because the chemistry of their product is challenging.  As for Aussie coal...that gets exported to the PRC.  The problem there was that capacity outpaced demand and the high cost mines got/are-being shaken out.  Again, the million dollar question from the Civeo perspective is what is the marginal cost of the Civeo customers? If that is below the current spot rate, then the customers will lay off workers and Civeo will have fewer people to house.  Unless they have guaranteed contracts for a minimum number of rooms (has anyone know anything to suggest this?).  Figure that out and you have some guaranteed karma + possibly real world cash.   Unless the macro situation changes wrt equities ;-)

Regarding the REIT conversion, here are two good introductions [[1]](http://www.merrilledge.com/publish/content/application/pdf/gwmol/BofAML-REIT-Primer.pdf) [[2]](http://urbanland.uli.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/10/USREITs_REITs_101_An_Introduction.pdf), as well as management's explanation [[3]](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2SLCEP/3537503007x0x783662/d974b63a-4a4c-4c76-9980-5a6266b5371c/2.2_2014-09-xx_Structural_Alternatives_PresVer23.pdf) [[4]](http://ir.civeo.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=873360).  Basically, a REIT is a tax advantaged structure in the United States for returning capital to investors.  Civeo generates 90% of its revenues outside of the United States, so the tax savings would be minimal.  I'm not sure if there is an equivalent tax code to a US REIT in Australia or Canada. Even it there was, it wouldn't help US investors who don't have a tax liability in those jurisdictions.

What Greenlight wants to achieve here is: 1.) Civeo will borrow against their semi-permanent (just look at the pictures, how many semi-arctic winters are those half-assed buildings expected to survive without significant capex) hotels in the middle of nowhere; and 2.) return proceeds from said loan(s) to shareholders.  I work in merchant banking (mainly loans for companies) and let me tell you that step one is a lot more challenging than getting a mortgage against a hotel in a major metropolitan area in the US/Canada/Australia.  Especially if the use of funds isn't reinvested in the collateral."

2014-10-11 02:48:50,"I've been looking at Civeo ever since the drop and it looks REALLY interesting. Selling at around 6x run rate and management projection EBITDA that has a lot of potential to go up when coal starts burning up(heh? And just 1-2 years ago EBITDA was at $500M from more australian coal contributions, but coal has died). Comps around 13-16x EBITDA. Canadian oil sands have much lower breakevens than most think. Contracts protect against most short term commodity fluctuations. Dividends could be doubled or tripled, leverage could be as well(Only problem is Civeo does in the end have commodity exposure, so maybe best not to take it up too much). 2 very smart, very motivated, very well known with a lot of clout, very deep pocketed activists who own 22% of the company. Can anyone who understand this stuff give some more color on the REIT conversion? Only reason not to invest right now is to wait while EBITDA goes down a bit more and catch a coal&amp;oil up cycle. By then though, people will realize this is really undervalued and start buying it again."
2014-10-10 23:18:12,"Regulatory Risk: Lawsky is an idiot. The focus is now almost all on ASPS since that last letter came out

Mortgage Runoff: I don't really like to focus on macro effects but they are currently experiencing highs in the constant prepayment rate because of the low interest rates. It would only be a concern if interest rates went lower and people kept refinancing more and more which isn't going to happen.

Auction Risk:There are currently $1 trillion UPB subprime loans outstanding. Ocwen claims they could acquire additional $500 billion UPB by 2018. After runoff assume they have $750 billion UPB. A 15 basis points bottom line would mean they would be making $1.1 billion dollars in free cash flow. And even if they cannot find more subprime loans there are $13 trillion in prime mortgages that banks are trying to get off their books. But they don't really service prime mortgages too much. Yes there could be a potential drive up in prices but that just means that Ocwen's competitors are getting screwed over more than Ocwen because Ocwen is the lowest cost operator and can handle a decline in revenue while Nationstar and Walter cannot. That's why I think it would literally be good for MSR prices to rise because it would put Nationstar and Walter out of business and Ocwen will always be the go to servicer for people wanting to sell MSRs cause they do it the most effectively and at the lowest cost. 

And the final question: Are you basically asking what multiple do MSRs buy and sell at relative to their bottom line yield? I think Subprime MSRs are yielding 20-30% because a ton of banks want to sell them and are driving down the price. "

2014-10-10 18:36:17,"IIRC they want to do a sale leaseback with $2 billion(?) in real estate and return the cash to shareholders.  The company has a market cap of $6 billion, so that's huge.  This might be priced in already, but I don't follow the stock closely enough to be able to tell."
2014-10-10 17:54:28,"I've slowly been trying to learn more about this industry since that post you made on Altisource a month or so ago. There's quite a few things I like so far about Bill Erbey and his portfolio of companies but for now I'll primarily focus on some of the risks involved:

* Regulatory risk - this seems to be one of the bigger one's especially with the current law suits though I reckon they won't get banned from buying up MSRs, but it's still an industry that's going to be under a lot of heavy regulatory scrutiny. In addition to this you have the effects of Dodd Frank, on one hand it's positive since majority of banks are trying to get MSRs off their books but on the other it will affect the loan originating business which will in turn affect the amount of MSRs available for purchase, I think prior to Dodd-Frank, between 30% to 40% of home loans got approved but due to more stringent regulations this number may fall.

* Mortgage Runoff - Interest rates are currently pretty low and some borrowers who refinanced may choose to pay off their mortgages a lot faster which would lead to less revenue for Ocwen, any concern about this?

* Auction Risk - MSRs are generally sold by auction though chances are that plenty were sold without auction in the past couple of years since there were a lot more willing sellers. Having no auctions or paying a lower price for their MSRs obviously works in Ocwen's favour but what if in the future there's more willing buyers which would drive MSR prices up and if you couple this with runoff risk in the industry at large then there could be a contraction in Ocwen's margins going forward.

And one final question, any idea what the current multiple is for the service release premium in relation to the MSR annual payment? And do you see the SRP going up in the future or staying at current levels?"

2014-12-16 01:07:40,"Warren is very pragmatic. Love reading his letters. 

Case in point: When Berkshire Hathaway purchased the Van Tuyl Group, the country's fifth-biggest auto dealership by sales

Context: - Number of new auto dealers are down (17,700 now vs.30,000 in 1970) - But average sales and profitability per dealership are up - ½ revenue from new car sales, but profitability from used car sales, F&amp;I products, financing, service

Buffet thought it was a classic platform opportunity: - The industry is highly fragmented b/c of family ownership; 10 largest dealers account for &gt;10 percent of new vehicle sales - Berkshire opportunity to buy other dealers and concentrate the industry, giving it cost and pricing advantages - The growing size of a dealer’s store base enables scale advantage: efficient allocation and pricing of inventory - Berkshire can take a used car and shop it within his network – keeps customers happy and better returns - The deal is a natural complement for Berkshire’s Geico, which could let Van Tuyl’s dealers sell auto insurance when people buy a car—“a key policy shopping juncture”

Warren's Long Term View: - Long term growth with safety - Beyond that, there is real estate value and a margin of safety - Warren isn't concerned with the near term SAAR cycle, he's focused on 100 year value"

Blackstone bought took the company private for 26 billion, borrowing 20.4 billion and putting in only 5.6 billion of their own money. 6 years later they take the company public again in 2013 making a profit of 12 billion. If they had invested that 5.6 billion into the public company and simply replaced management, the company's market value would have had to triple from 26 billion to 78 billion in order for them to make a similar profit like they did with LBO.It may not be easier but if your goal is to magnify your profits, then take on leverage do a buyout, take private until you reduce the debt burden then IPO and let the money flow in."

 [**Blended value**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended%20value): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Blended Value__ refers to an emerging conceptual framework in which non-profit organizations, businesses, and investments are evaluated based on their ability to generate a blend of financial, social, and environmental value. The term is usually attributed to Jed Emerson, and sometimes used interchangeably with [triple bottom line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line). Blended value propositions are founded on the notion that value cannot be bifurcated, and is inherently made up more than one measurement of performance. For example, under a blended value proposition, a for-profit businesses would consider their social and environmental impact on society alongside their financial performance measurement. Within the same context, non-profits would consider their financial efficiency and sustainability in tandem with their social and environmental performance. Blended value suggests the true measure of any organization is in its ability to holistically perform in all 3 areas.

Color from the street is there's a provision in the merger agreement that would allow MRK to walk in theory (trigger material adverse effect clause). The trouble isn't with the existence of that -- they are always in the docs -- but that the provision hasn't been publicly disclosed.

2014-12-08 22:44:27,"In situations like this, I like to think about the event path that would signal that things are at or near their worst. Right now, the drivers for Russia's economy, and thus Sberbank's prospects, still have material downside risk.

You have outlined Russia's economic decline due to falling oil prices and sanctions as the main risk for Sberbank. The bottom is not in as far as oil prices are concerned. Whenever commodity markets are oversupplied, prices overshoot marginal costs to the downside. If recent articles are to be believed, marginal cost is in the $50-$60 for many US shale plays, and oil prices are still $67/barrel. If these oil shale E&amp;P companies were under severe stress, I would expect to see land rig counts focused on oil to be near 2008-2009 lows, rig mixes switching towards gas, forward CapEx guidance decreases, and to see bankruptcies and asset sales in the press. China, Japan, the EU, and other emerging markets are expecting slower GDP growth, so I wouldn't expect a large upside demand surprise. Near the end of the crisis, I'd expect to see OPEC decreasing supply or raising prices. I'm not really seeing that yet so I'm waiting for things to get really fucked. You could use the collapse in natural gas prices in 2012 as an analogue for the potential price evolution.

On the sanctions side of things, I don't see any signs of amelioration between Russia and the West. This may be the type of thing that has to wait until new administrations come in. I'm not a foreign policy/politics wonk so I'd defer to someone else on this. All I know is people can hold grudges for a long time and this could take longer to revert to mean than oil prices. 

Moreover, Russia is not in recession yet, but it's definitely headed there. While Sberbank is cheap, I'd wait to initiate a position. However, this is a matter of style. Most value investors are early and prefer to average down. I prefer waiting for events to happen and then initiating a position, even if I end up being late. Nobody hits the bottom tick. 

To that end, I agree with alector that your initial position size is much too large. If you prefer to be early, I'd start with a small position (like &lt;1%) and average down. I'd expect you to have to hold this position 5+ years, so keep that in mind as well.

I have no position here, and have done no thorough analysis, but those are my thoughts."

If you actually work for a BB, go pull down your sell side research for some oil and gas companies and look up how they build an NAV for valuation. It sure as hell isn't by looking at the balance sheet and plopping down the book value.

 [**Net asset value**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net%20asset%20value): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Net asset value__ (__NAV__) is the value of an entity's [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) minus the value of its [liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(accounting\)), often in relation to [open-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-end_fund) or [mutual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund) funds, since shares of such funds registered with the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) are redeemed at their net asset value. This may also be the same as the [book value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_value) or the [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholders%27_equity) value of a business. Net asset value may represent the value of the total equity, or it may be divided by the number of [shares outstanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares_outstanding) held by investors and, thereby, represent the net asset value *per share*.

2014-12-08 14:28:56,"No, it's moreso taking the assets/property today and liquidating them, then discounting those cash flows like normal. If you have a more specific question, it'd probably be easier to address your scenario. 

If you bought a piece of land to drill 30 wells for oil, you'd model it as if you drilled 3 wells per year for 10 years and collected the production/cash flow from those wells out into the future for as long as they're economic. Then you'd discount those resulting cash flows.

"
2014-12-08 14:22:57,"You may work for a BB, but not in the relevant industries. NAV is a different method of modelling, not historical.  NAV models are more of a liquidation/blowdown of existing assets.

Y0 = 1,000 mbbl in Reserves  
Y1 = Produced &amp; sold 250 mbbl @ $100/bbl  
Y2 = Produced &amp; sold 200 mbbl @ $110/bbl  
Y3 = Produced &amp; sold 150 mbbl @ $105/bbl  
Y4 = Produced &amp; sold 125 mbbl @ $102/bbl  
Y5 = Produced &amp; sold 100 mbbl @ $98/bbl  
Y6 = Produced &amp; sold 75 mbbl @ $95/bbl  
Y7 = Produced &amp; sold 50 mbbl @ $90/bbl  
Y8 = Produced &amp; sold 50 mbbl @ $90/bbl  

At the end of Year 8, all of the reserves have been produced and the asset is depleted. We'd now calculate the value of those cash flows like any other company, assume expenses, take out taxes, and discount the ending income back to a present value. "

2014-12-08 12:54:27,So NAV is just a DCF without the terminal value?
2014-12-08 10:45:45,"Discounted Cash Flow = We have assets and a business model that can be reasonably forecasted into the future  
Net Asset Value = We have assets today, but once depleted, our assets hold no value  

The difference is that in Oil &amp; Gas or Real Estate, once you've depleted your assets (run out of hydrocarbons or building is in shambles), all you have left is land.  In other businesses, like semi-conductors, you have an operating business with R&amp;D, manufacturing, patents, and other assets that do not have a cutoff period for when they'll have no remaining value. They'll have to use capital to continue those processes and running those businesses, but they do not have to inherently buy new assets to continue existing.

Normal DCF businesses can assume perpetual growth in to the future, whereas the NAV businesses do not. Oil &amp; Gas production will decline to an uneconomical level and be shut down. Building's will get run down, bring in less rent, and require so much maintenance that they will be abandoned. "
2014-12-08 10:29:18,"The value of a company comes from what it has and what it expects to earn in the future, so to pick the best valuation method you need to look at specifically what drives that company's revenues. 

In the case of gas companies, their revenues, and therefore value of the firm, are affected by changes in what people are willing to pay (value) for gas (asset) so the NAV method would be most appropriate. 

For companies like walmart, where their costs are pretty stable, their value will be most affected by changes in revenue patterns like having bad holiday sales or exceeding quarterly sales goals.  These revenue changes are changes in future cash flows, so the DCF method would most be most appropriate.

Just ask yourself ""how does that company make most of its money"" and then ""what factor(s) will have a material effect on that number, whether positively or negatively"" and pick the valuation method most relevant to that factor.  "
2014-12-08 07:29:21,NAV is a hack to use when using a DCF to find the net present value of a company's cash flow involves so much uncertainty that it's useless.
2014-12-08 05:18:41,"Yes, she doesn't mention any facts or issues that you can really argue with. It's the synthesis of the facts that may be the issue, like you said, whether the slowing growth will actually lead to a recession or not."
2014-12-08 02:40:09,"&gt; The main thing different about the interviewee this time is that she actually has a lot of experience in the country

Eh. Every market has many, many ""experts"" with hands-on experience who constantly make contradictory predictions to each other.  Macroeconomics is just too damn complicated to predict with any certainty, and this lady sure seems to have a lot of certainty. 

The din of constant, worthless predictions on the Street is almost deafening. I think that's why Buffett stayed in Omaha.
"
2014-12-08 02:22:03,"Extraordinary claims need pretty extraordinary proof. But I don't think people writing about or talking about China hold themselves to this standard at all. The main thing different about the interviewee this time is that she actually has a lot of experience in the country, which just goes to show how flimsy the experience of a lot of others who make these types of claims even without any basic background are."
2014-12-08 01:25:04,"&gt; She uses very inflammatory language.

This was the red flag to me. The argument she's making is internally consistent, but it smacks of attention-seeking journalism that Barron's chose to interview this lady, who is clearly very bearish, since it is the basis of her livelihood:

&gt; She ultimately makes money by scaring Western investors and executives. It doesn't seem like she's actually an investor.

I recall a statistic that negative headlines outnumber positive headlines 12:1. I wouldn't read too much into this article until reading a piece from a bullish person who used similarly extreme language. Fair is fair.

That isn't much of a refutation of any of the things that she said, but then again, everything she said is too open-ended to be directly refutable (or, as a result, useful)."
2014-12-07 21:57:06,"I do not know whether her arguments are valid or not, as that depends on whether her assertions are correct, which is a factual determination that no one really has the ability to make.

My brief thoughts:

- Her arguments are reasonable, but in the end they are the same arguments that all the China bears have been using for decades.
- The fact that statistics are doctored isn't in itself proof of anything except the unreliability of those statistics and the fact that China is a closed society. 
- She uses very inflammatory language.
- She ultimately makes money by scaring Western investors and executives. It doesn't seem like she's actually an investor.
- She is much more credible than the usual China bear, who only takes a few trips to China and doesn't speak the language. But there are a lot of people who have as much experience or more with China who have the opposite view. And this is a person who bought into Maoism...that does show a certain fundamental willingness to buy into tropes.

In the end I really don't know whether she is right or wrong. As with all writing on China, I take issue with the certainty of her propositions. I don't think the issues are knowable to the degree she alleges."
2014-12-07 15:25:02,"Not entirely sure but looking at their financial statements it seems like they've had extremely narrow operating margins for a while and a significant amount in accounts payable and long term debt. Could just be a cashflow issue in that they will have no ability to make those payments without taking on more debt. Their interest coverage ratio is probably around 1 to 2 so no one would really lend to them leaving them screwed in the short term.

Its a shame cause they used to be a predominant player in the gulf but they have such high fixed costs coupled with the fact that their financials were not handled properly.

BUT i could be totally wrong and they could get some emergency funding and come back. what are your thoughts?"

2014-12-07 10:25:19,"This is the first time I have heard of discalcula. Very interesting to read up on it. 

I think others have mentioned it but I will mention it again. You really need to talk to her and explain what your thoughts, aspirations and concerns are. Part of being a couple is communicating and if you can't figure out how to do that now then the relationship will be in trouble over the long term regardless of $ issues. 

I would try to avoid the ""this will never work"" or ""follow your love"" binary advice. What makes a relationship work is the strength of the relationship between the two people. If you are able to create a strong and trusting bond then I think that can overcome any other issues you may have. 

This discussion between the two of you is a first step as a couple in understanding if such a relationship is possible. 

I would also caution you to make sure that you are **very** aware of her feelings and emotions when discussing it. We all have our quirks and when S.O.s or others start talking about our quirks it is easy to get really sensitive or upset about it. 

Best of luck!

2015-01-24 05:56:13,"You call that money the monetary base, which is not considered ""printing money"". Sure, the monetary supply (actual money circulating in the economy) rose as well, but not to an extent that we have problems (see our inflation rate). We're always printing money, it's simply how our banking system works. It's only a problem when it's causing inflation."
2015-01-24 03:51:37,"Well, yes we did, right?  The Fed bought a shit ton of bonds with money they effectively printed.  The bonds are still on their books.  So if you include the Fed in the calculations for the total pool of money/assets, we did.  Right?"

2015-01-23 10:49:44,"I agree...I think the answer to all of this is that XBRL needs to be simplified and everyone would win. Get rid of the XBRL consortium (which are the big accounting firms &amp; data companies that create xbrl filings...they have an incentive to complicate XBRL). There's 18K elements and it's a real mess to try to make sense of it all. If I remember right there about 500 different ways a company can report revenue. Then if you want to calculate ebitda you need to figure out all the possible combinations of ways a company can report ebit, depreciation, and amortization. It really is a sh*t-show. I think the answer is to reduce the number of elements and simplify the structure to JSON (rather than XML, which can be confusing.....or simplify the xml markup).

I am probably a bit biased (I run www.jivedata.com).

2013-02-15 16:48:22,"Pretty much. I do not think it could cause a short squeeze that has everyone up in arms, because let's say hypothetically the company is bought out, well Ackman will just cover his position at the buyout price.

A short squeeze will only happen if Ackman decides to cover his position, in a relatively short period of time because the stock moves up beyond his risk tolerance.

I cannot foresee Ackman covering his position though. Even if the company goes to the $50s, if his short thesis is correct, the company will inevitably run out of target people on the planet... It's already getting pretty close. The revenue of the company, theoretically, will increase at a rapid rate as the reach of the company is maximized globally. After that, revenue will drop precipitously. Did Ackman and Einhorn call the top too soon? Time will tell, but in the meantime, they are also hoping that the courts take action before shareholders are destroyed when that reach does finally reach maximization."
2013-02-15 16:29:49,"Sorry, but what exactly does it mean if his shares are called back? As in if someone tries to buy out the firm and Ackman has to return the shares he shorted?"
2013-02-15 16:19:20,"that is indeed the standard thinking.  Its pretty gutsy to buy an FTC investigated company though.  Since the stock started at $44 today and ended below $39, so the day turned into a long squeeze.

You're right that Ackman risks that other people join in with Icahn to push up the price.  After thinking about it through day, the fact Icahn bought 13m shares does suggest he's ""serious"" and may buy more, but it also doesn't mean anything definite.  

Because Icahn didn't use cash and stock to buy the shares, (using margin) he will have to come up with $500M cash when the options expire.  He might face some pressure to sell instead of raising that cash."
2013-02-15 14:47:52,"I've only looked at this for a very short amount of time, so if anybody is more knowledgeable, please correct any mistakes I have. Ackman publicly disclosed that he's shorting 20 mil shares, approximately 20% of the company.  This means that some time in the future, Ackman is obligated to buy 20 million shares off of the open market.

If Icahn can continue to buy shares, and/or partner up with some other influential shareholders, they can take the company private and basically force Ackman to pay up at a massive loss.  It's the market moving in anticipation of a short squeeze."

http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2013/01/HLF%2013D%20accumulation.jpg"
2013-02-15 12:44:45,"We're going to see lots of PR coming out in the near future. Ackman is going to be pushing the courts to make some moves, and Icahn is going to peddle as much shit about a buyout, etc... as he can.

If Ackman's short argument is correct, and the pyramid scheme is going to run its course sometime in the future, his argument will win inevitably, no matter what happens in the short-term.

The concern is if Icahn takes the company private. No matter what happens to HLF in the future, if Ackman's shares are called back above his average, he will lose his bet, even if he was correct about the company. The question is, are there enough super-weight investors to come together to buy HLF in the $4-5B range? Time will tell. But from the looks of today's trading, we may be hitting $37s today even, and that is a technical win for Ackman.

The angle Icahn may be playing is that if he and some other bigshots come together and take HLF private, they can make a profit selling off the company assets (and kill the company), w/ means they agree with Ackman's short thesis. Can a profit be made if they take the company private in the $4-5B range? Who knows! Makes for a great story though.

I think Ackman has more patience than Icahn, so Icahn needs to take the company private w/ the help of other large investors, in the upper $4B range, in order to win this bout. That can only happen for Icahn if HLF has enough to justify such a buyout, and that requires more than just Icahn to come together. An Icahn-led coalition is effectively a message of what they intend to do to the company if they take it private.

If the buyout doesn't happen, this is going to turn into one of the most epic short win in recent history."

2013-02-08 22:23:55,"To this I agree, I would actually expect the common stock to drop due to the new debt obligation, but I am uncertain what would occur if the stockholders get the preferred.

All in all, Einhorn's idea is pretty rock solid psychologically. Bond holders would want to buy the preferred for sure so if Apple states something like ""for each preferred share you must own one apple common stock"" then yeah that stock price will sky rocket."
2013-02-08 21:14:51,"&gt;Bottom line: If Apple’s share were trading at fair value today (let’s say, at $450/share) and each Apple shareholder were granted a preferred share, with a preferred dividend of 4% and face value of $100, here is what the shareholders will end up holding tomorrow: a common stock with a value of $350 and a preferred share with a value of $100.

Einhorn's response to this was the following thought experiment: If AAPL granted preferred stock with a face value of $450, would the equity go to zero? If it were $550 would it be negative?"
2013-02-08 20:35:45,"I read that the preferreds would be issued to existing common shareholders, not new investors. Realizing that got me over my hang up. "
2013-02-08 20:24:43,"My thoughts is that dispersing preferred shares will give a psychological boost. Similar to the idea of how apple's dividend announcement jumped the stock.

However, preferred shares are pretty much debt obligations so capital structure could possibly play a role, but I really can't see why Apple would have to pay 4% on its short term debt given its credit and cash.

Thus, my bet is on pure psychological boost to the market. A signal play if you will. If Apple does nothing with its buckets of cash at least preferred holders will get a 4% return which is better than 30 year treasury."

If this was looking at the value of all companies as a percent of GNP, then I could get behind that. Unfortunately, that includes private companies with subjective meanings of value, so I don't think my idea is possible.

Alternatively, there are market cap as percent of market fair value. Fair value derives from sum of analyst opinions on all stock in that index so it ain't perfect either. Morningstar has a good one."

""The Hook

“Every bull and bear market needs a ‘hook.’ The hook in a bear market is whatever the bear serves to keep investors and traders thinking that everything is going to be all right. There is always a hook.”

Richard Russell, Dow Theory Letters, November 2000 (S&amp;P 1400)

One of the striking things about the late-1990’s bubble was that even investment professionals who should have known better were swept into New Economy thinking. To some extent, the same dynamic is true today – even among some investors whom I greatly admire.

For example, back in 1999, Warren Buffett correctly warned “In my opinion, you have to be wildly optimistic to believe that corporate profits as a percent of GDP can, for any sustained period, hold much above 6%... Maybe you’d like to argue a different case. Fair enough. But give me your assumptions. The Tinker Bell approach – clap if you believe – just won’t cut it.”

Yet today, with corporate profits near 11% of GDP – a level that is clearly explained by massive federal deficits and depressed personal savings – not a peep.

The “hook” today is the dramatically elevated, deficit-induced level of profit margins. While the complete faith of investors in the Federal Reserve may prove to be the hook for ordinary investors, it’s not enough to draw in more careful observers. The real hook, in my view, is the absence of a bubble in any individual sector, and instead a bubble in profit margins across the entire corporate sector. That is the hook that serves to keep investors and traders thinking that everything is going to be all right."""
2013-03-26 16:15:44,"Right, that's the gist of what I was saying.  I think that there will be an eventual reversion to the mean, but I don't think it's coming for 2-3 years because we've yet to see the ""OMG BUY BUY BUY"" attitude that usually precedes a correction.  ""Pride goeth before the fall,"" so to speak."
2013-03-26 16:14:06,"I completely agree that the U.S. is a boom/bust cycle economy that will eventually revert back to the mean, but I differ slightly from your view in two respects.  First, my opinion is that each reversion will always result in a higher mean than the previous mean, due to several factors, not the least of which are inflation and technological advancement.  Second, while I concur that the U.S. economy is on its way to a peak from which it will drop, I think we do have a ways to go before that new peak is reached.

Where I agree with you is that this current market is fueled mostly by the Fed's actions of the past 5-6 years.  However, I believe that more fuel will come from a slow jobs recovery that will put more disposable income in the pockets of middle income Americans.  The tightness in the wallets will eventually loosen, leading to a sort of second wave of good vibes before the helium comes out of the balloon.

My attitude toward the market right now is that I bought in right around mid-2011 and am looking to ride the upward wave until I get signs that the roller coaster will start dropping.  Again, while I agree with you that the peak will not be permanent, it's my view that we are still about 2-3 years off before the peak is actually reached.  My own instinct (obviously a high probability of being wrong) says that there is a lot of room for ""irrational exuberance"" from regular Joes to push everything to truly unreasonable levels before reality sets in."
2013-03-26 16:06:53,"&gt; Buffett must feel like he has a better place to deploy the capital” than in Goldman Sachs. 

Buffett is right. GS stock hasn't really been going anywhere. They have historically made a lot of their profits from proprietary trading, which could result in a large and unexpected ""whale trade"" loss. GS could also be a target for more regulation. Buffett went through a lot of trouble during the Soloman fiasco. This move doesn't surprise me at all.

The problem is that each peak in the market is accompanied by completely plausible arguments for why the peak is permanent, starting with the South Sea Bubble in 1716, and more recently the LBO/takeover boom in the late '80s, the tech boom in the late '90s, and the private equity / property boom in the mid 2000s.

2013-03-26 13:06:43,"Good piece, but while the Buffett quote is very informative, it's from 2001.  I would offer as food for thought that, since that point, several major technological advancements and governmental actions have made it such that corporations are in a position to profit more than they ever have in all of history.  Not only can they do more with much thinner work forces, but in terms of real wages, the cost of that labor is also decreasing.

While I agree that the data in your article is quite strong and merits lengthy consideration, my two cents would be that another qualitative factor to think about is that a paradigm shift is occurring."

I don't have data on this but if something like SOX was driving companies away from public ownership or for that matter something was affecting the ""balance"" between public companies and privately held companies then the ratio would be affected by that. If you do the thought experiment where valuations etc. remain identical but (say) MSFT, AAPL, XOM and IBM go private then there goes 1.5 trillion from one side of the ratio. Total stock market capitalization drops ~10% so the ratio changes but GNP wouldn't be affected.

|:-----|------|------|------:|
| Operating EBIT | 31,013 | 27,275 | Same as in previous table [10] |
| Non-cash income from first-time consolidation | –184 | –3,158 | |
| Income taxes paid | –4,140 | –1,415 | Taxes increased in Germany |
| Non-cash income | 0 | –522 | |
| **Depreciation/amortization** | **15,113** | **15,825** | Selling old machine parts? |
| Changes in pension provisions | 603 | 916 | |
| **Gross cash flow** | **42,405** | **38,921** | Sum of rows above |

31,013 is what they earned this year, so obviously the ""depreciation/amortization"" item is very significant. Yet in the notes, they are explained only as:

&gt; No non-scheduled depreciation/amortization was required in the
year under review. Further details on depreciation/amortization
are set out in the consolidated statement of changes in assets.

i.e. it tells you to look at the table I just quoted. Hidden away in another part of the report, I found that this positive depreciation means they were selling old equipment at a higher price than they originally bought them, so they made a profit on them. I guess that's possible, although I don't see why would someone pay more for used equipment that for a new one... Anyway, their overall property and equipment assets increased, so it's not like they were stripping needed assets and selling them.    
Their inventory decreased from 89 million to 82.4, but their order backlog increased from 1.0 to 1.6 billion.

They have two business units: ""Space systems"" and ""Aerospace"". Their margins decreased from 6.81% to 5.43% in ""Space systems"" but increased from 1.1% to 3.8% in ""Aerospace"". I guess that means it remained flat.

They spend 16.9 million on R&amp;D (up from 15.0) which isn't really that much, considering they have 632 million in revenues. However, compared to their EBIT, it's more than 50%, so I'm not sure if that's great or bad.

What I really like about this company (why I bought them in the first place) is their increasing dividends, which I think is a pretty good sign about their future. 

| 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 |
|:-----|-------|-----|------|------|-------|------:|
| 0.37 | 0.35 | 0.30 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.23 |

However, now they have a P/E ratio of 16.73 / 0.85 = 19.68 which is a bit too high for me, this is why I'm trying to find something wrong in this report since I'm afraid it may go down quickly if there's anything I may miss.

Am I calculating the PEG ratio right? If Earnings per share for 2012 was 0.85, and for 2011 it was 0.78, then 

annual EPS growth = 0.85/0.78 = 1.089 == 8.9%    
PE = 19.68   
PEG = 19.68/8.9 = 2.21   

That would mean the current stock is expensive?"

2013-03-25 15:23:36,"Hi,

I can help you out, I think you're missing a few small things that are contributing to your confusion.

1) Line 16 isn't net income, it's net financial income or expense.  This is another way of saying interest income or interest expense.  In their case it's negative so most likley they have debt and this is their interest expense.
2) Looks like retained earnings.  The company made 14m, and carried forward is previous profit minus dividends forward.  I'm guessing this links up very well to equity.
3) You're dividing the wrong fields, net income after minority interests is 14.826m, divide that by 17.387 shares and you get .85 per share.
4) According to the income statement that you show they're profitable, they earned 14m which was .85 per share.

So where to go from here?  

I'd probably investigate operating cash flow, you said it's a lot higher, what's driving that?  Is it sustainable, is it inventory or receivable workdowns?

How do margins compare to previous years, what's the trend in earnings?  Is this a good result etc.

Hope this helps!"

What I have understood from your comment is that price appreciation was the cause of the bubble which is technically true similar to my ""flu"" example. I agree that there were many many causes, it seemed to me as if your comment stated that house appreciation was the ""cause"" and overlooked things such as interest rates.

"
2013-03-22 11:53:52,"I kind of dislike the use of house price appreciation as the sole factor.

In economics/econometrics house price appreciation would definitely be the ""cause"", but I have had some good arguments with professors about this concept of correlation and causation. I think everyone knows that the cause is the most important part, but hypothetically lets say someone stabbed you with a needle that had HIV. You die of the common flu.

What would be the cause of your death? Would it be HIV? Would it be the Flu? Or would it be the action of stabbing that caused the HIV?

Technically, the flu was the cause of the death.

Similarly, house appreciation is the cause for a housing bubble, but lets not forget the other factors."

&gt; Most people at the time believed that widespread 
defaults on mortgages were a function of ***some combination of structural economic factors such as unemployment rates***, interest rates, and regional economic health. That’s why so many on Wall Street were happy to sell Paulson C.D.S. policies: they thought it would take a perfect storm to bring the market to its knees. But Pellegrini’s data showed that ***the bubble was being inflated by a single, rickety factor— rising home prices.***

Yeah, some *mysterious* combination of structural economic factors, like house prices going to the moon, and creating an orgy of credit driven consumption. This drove me nuts at the time, watching those dimwits on the business channels saying that the economy was fine. Clearly ""economic health"" during the bubble was from house price appreciation from helocs and the like. It's taken me a while to understand the pyschological blocks that most people have that keep them from seeing the obvious.

2013-03-18 18:38:43,"Panfry,

Thanks for posting it, thesis is well thought out for a first pass.  I got really excited for a second because I thought this was /r/investing and I thought someone was actually posting a substantive thought process for investing, and then I was disappointed.  Please continue to post your thought processes on this subreddit as you think of them.  

In any case, I wanted to post because I’ve done some research into GPS devices professionally and personally.  During the time I was doing research into GPS, (about 6 months ago) I also looked into the companies and noticed, the same way you have, the cheapness of the pureplay GPS competitors in this area. 

Here’s the skinny on these companies: they are cheap because their products have a huge risk of not selling in the future.  They lack long-term (especially 10 years) earnings power.  

So think of your normal GPS unit that has a suction cup stand in your car: those have eroded in price from $300 to now $50-$100.  This is due to the competition from smartphones and the cheapness of the actual hardware.

Instead, GPS companies have shifted to offering in-dash navigation GPS units as opposed to these standalone products.  From my understanding, these are sold to car manufacturers at a cost of $300-$700.  Given that they are almost the exact thing as a standalong product, you can see how this is a step-up in margin from the normal standalone GPS unit.  However, the product inside is almost exactly the same, except maybe you get a huge touch screen instead.  Seriously.  These in-dash navigation units used to be huge selling points especially in luxury vehicles but are now not as much of a priority.  I encourage you to stop by a Lexus or Mercedes dealership and ask the salesmen whether having a GPS is a selling point or not.  You’ll see my point.  

The competition for GPS units is absolutely free and works very well.  I don’t know if you have an iphone or the latest version of google maps, but basically for me and a lot of my friends, it’s been a perfect substitute to any GPS app.  It even has good voice navigation, which previously was a barrier for free navigation applications (debatable, but generally true).  How can you expect someone to pay $700 to compete with free?  That has a huge potential to erode your user base if your competition is free.  

Size the market for their various GPS implementations: I think you’ll find their growth constrained and no segment to be certain in the future in terms of revenues.  Contrast this with coca cola: Unless there’s some super bad ingredient that I’m unaware of in coke, I’m sure that people will still drink coke in 10 years.

In any case, even if the future is extremely dire, I think that something can still be cheap enough that you’re interested.  After all, if someone tells you that a $100 million dollar piece of equipment (new) that requires no upkeep is selling for $10 bucks, not many people would say no to buying that, right?  I would buy the stock only with a huge margin of error: it has to sell for around net current asset value.  So I would only invest if equity value was less than $1.5 billion or thereabouts.  I think it’s worth it at that price because it can still continue to provide positive free cash flow even at depressed sales levels.  For a 10 year holding period, you just don’t know where GPS will be in 10 years.  I don’t think this is a good holding for that time period.  

TLDR: Earnings power is highly uncertain, needs to be a lot cheaper for me to consider investment.  Future prospects in GPS are slim given alternatives like google maps are free.

2013-03-18 02:48:08,"I made an investment in Garmin when they were wildly undervalued, at around $14/share. I sold out completely at around $45, because I thought that was too high.

I would say that Garmin's business will continue to struggle with growth because their largest segment is automobiles (people are still buying their products, they just don't need 2 or 3 of them), but the core company will remain highly profitable. If anyone out there says that the company will die, don't listen to them. The balance sheet is great!

The main issue I had with Garmin was that their management seemed pretty mediocre. They wasted a lot of money pursuing projects that were far from the company's main business. Eventually they stopped doing this and started paying a dividend/repurchasing shares, but it was still quite annoying.

Personally, if I was a private equity person I would be thirsty for that cash flow, but as an investment you can probably find better options.

You did a wonderful analysis though."
2013-03-18 01:28:18,"Thanks everyone for your replies. Garmin looks good but I guess not that good. If it was like 20 bucks a share I would probably pounce on it but I think at around 36 right now it's neither a value nor a growth play. I'll keep looking around for a smoker. Thanks!

2013-03-17 22:06:33,"let me preface this with ive never owned grmn nor intend to.....they sell a product that i jsust dont need so i find it hard to get excited....

that being said it certainly seems to be a product that other people want for whatever reason (i just use my smartphone) so i find it hard to value


at 12 times earnings plus a nice dividend it seems somewhat reason but im not sure how much higher it really goes"
2013-03-17 20:46:21,"Well, on a purely anecdotal note: I've used both garmin and google maps. Garmin was not only slower in every way but it wasn't nearly as accurate as google maps...which is free. Few of my friends regretted their purchases also. 

So... yea"
2013-03-17 20:11:25,"I should clarify. I don't think it's necessarily a bad stock, but it's a gamble. Could be a great buy, could be bad, at least in my opinion. They have great financials, but it depends on their leadership and responsiveness. They have a good amount of cash on hand, but they have to use it, and quick."
2013-03-17 20:08:34,"I don't know about 10 years... Pretty hard to predict a somewhat new market like that. It does stand out, but their declining revenues (which is why their stock went down in the first place) is not a great sign. There are a ton of players in the GPS market, especially since everyone knows it's growing."
2013-03-17 19:42:27,"I'm looking for a stock I can hold for at least 10 years but this may not be a good answer for a tech stock like this. They make GPS related devices in sports, animal tracking, smartlhone, automotive, marine and aviation. I think compared to the competition, Garmin definitely has a brand name that people will pay more for. They are expanding internationally from what I'm reading.

I think what's bothering me is the proliferation of Smart Phones with software GPS applications that can undercut Garmin's business. I'm sure smart phones cannot undermine aviation gps due to FAA regulation,(moat) and smart phones are mostly not Standalone GPS and require cellular service to download maps but technology is changing quite rapidly.  

I just don't see a strong moat. How about you?

Thank you for the reply!"
2013-03-17 19:14:15,"How long-term are you looking for it? I think you're right, long term. Very decent fundamentals. Do they have any other projects going on other than their gps systems?

Their dividend growth isn't too bad either. 

Annually:
2009 = $0.75 per share
2010 = $1.50 per share
2011 = $1.60 per share
2012 = $1.80 per share

Their falling revenues might be an issue though. Competition might be too severe for them to survive with their high dividend yield."

I was considering using P/S but a lot of other members disagreed and said I should just use P/E.  I didn't want to use EV mostly because QCOR has no debt and all the companies in my comp group had debt.

2013-03-17 12:25:50,"You're not providing enough information for me to provide a detailed answer. Moreover, this is a school project, so I'd just go back and ask the people who disagreed with your techniques what you did wrong.

I do know that weighting by market cap is the wrong way to do things. If you're weighting multiples, it should be based on how similar the comps' businesses are to the company you're valuing.  Additionally, P/E may not be the best multiple to use in your comp set as it is distorted by capital structure.

Stock buybacks aren't only done to restock the treasury holding, they can actually be purchased and cancelled by the company, increasing the current holders ownership percentage of the company and returning value this way

2013-08-22 17:16:14,"Wizzard had very little debt. Their balance sheet was positive, but they were cashflow negative.

I'm not sure how Wizzard managed to score the deal. I think there were many things attractive to FAB about being acquired by an American company. They're trying to create a culture of legal, pid-for media consumption. To do that they need: powerful branding, an aura of clout, and an air of legitimacy.  Why Wizzard, I am not positive. FAB had a physical media distribution network in the form of kiosks. Wizzard had a digital media distribution network, in the form of podcasting. I think the sales pitch went, ""FAB will prosper more if you combine your strengths with our strengths. Sure, a giant american media corporation would be even better, but you can come with us now or keep waiting for them to call.""

Functionally, it's more of a merger. The board is a combination from both companies. Legally, it's more of an acquisition, because FAB wouldn't enjoy the same benefits if they merged with or bought Wizzard than if Wizzard bought FAB.

Best I can explain it."
2013-08-22 15:05:19,I've been a subscriber for 3 years. Jim grant is top notch. If you can afford it I highly suggest it. Not all his ideas are winners. And honestly I've used very little of his ideas but as far as a macro sense of things go he is one of the best. I look forward to getting it in the mail every two weeks.
2013-08-22 14:26:47,"The 20 million in shares is compensation, but imagine it this way.  Lets say you have a business that's throwing off cash - maybe making 250K a year profit and I, like your American company, am deeply in the red.  If I come to you and say do you want to merge?  I'll give you 20MM shares in the new company.

What's in it for you?  You are now in a worse position.  No one should take that deal.  It would be helpful if you could explain what you mean by deeply in the red.  Was the acquirer profitable and deeply in debt?  Or maybe their balance sheet was positive, but they were losing money every quarter?"

2013-08-22 12:34:23,"Thanks for the review (and the rest of your contributions).

Bought the book, shipping to Canada is a bit behind on Amazon."
2013-08-22 11:20:03,"I couldn't ever justify the price tag personally, but if you get access to Grant's through work, consume every copy."
2013-08-22 02:03:17,"In short, I highly recommend *The Manual of Ideas* by John Mihaljevic. 

I originally went to Barnes and Noble to ""preview"" the book. I read through chapters 2,3,4, and 8 before going home to buy the book on Amazon (Show rooming is very real). Value Investing books usually fall into four categories that parallel/span the investment process. They focus on Investment Search, Investment Analysis, Portfolio/Risk Management, or all three holistically in an Investment Philosophy format. There are very few books that fall predominantly into the Investment Search bucket. *The Manual of Ideas* covers Investment Search for Value Investing ideas extensively and has a dusting of ideas on  Investment Analysis and Risk Management.

Mihaljevic divides Value Investing ideas into 9 categories: Deep Value, Sum of the Parts Value, Magic Formula Stocks, Jockey Stocks, Super Investor Stocks, Small Cap Stocks, Special Situations, Equity Stubs, and International Value Stocks. Numerous examples of each type of opportunity are provided in each chapter and examples from his experience and other fund managers are provided to explain his processes clearly.

He acknowledges that each of these categories has overlap with one another. In the Special Situations chapter, he'll mention Inflection Point stocks that were also mentioned in the Sum of the Parts Value chapter. In the Equity Stub chapter, he mentions Spinoffs which were also in the Special Situations chapter. In the Super Investor chapter, he mentions all the other styles. 

Each type of opportunity has discrete concerns and processes investors should be aware of.  In each of the sections, Mihaljevic explains why the approach works, missteps investors make in taking the approach, how you screen for those opportunities, how you find the opportunities without screens, and other risks you should consider when pursuing these opportunities.  

The book has fantastic references. An list of sources is included at the end of each chapter and a master index of sources is included at the end of the book. Many of these references are online  and links provided in the text. I bought this in Kindle format (because iBooks screwed me before) and read it on my iPad. It is extremely convenient flipping back and forth between the book and online sourced material. Also, many of the sources are from interviews in the Manual of Ideas newsletters. You can sign up for a free trial on the site and download all the past issues of the newsletter. The newsletters themselves are a great resource for learning more about the investment search process.

The other greatest thing about the book is the list of great investors he provides. He does this in both the Super Investor chapter and the International Value chapter. There were quite a few investors with great records I was unaware of. I have many more 13F's to follow and investors to research.

It was very encouraging to read this book. There was a quote from David Einhorn that summarized how my investment search process has changed:

&gt;We take the traditional value investor's process and just flip it around a little bit.  The traditional value investor asks ""Is this cheap?"" and then ""Why is it cheap?"" We start by identifying a reason something might be mispriced, and then if we find a reason why something is likely mispriced, then we make a determination whether it's cheap.

Over the past year, I've been drawn more towards special situations where securities can be categorically cheap, rather than statistically screening for opportunities. Moreover, I try to reverse engineer every great investment idea I see to determine how the author found the idea in the first place. This process yields a slowly expanding list of special situations I use to find my subsequent investment ideas. This book pushes me even further in that direction. While my thoughts around investment search were mostly formed, Mihaljevic stated and structured his process much better than I could. 

I've already read this book 1.5 times and I'll be reading this book again (highlighting interesting passages). I'm not very familiar with Equity Stubs (besides getting burned by SVU) and International Value investing and I learned the most from those chapters. I plan on stealing liberally from *The Manual of Ideas* and incorporating its concepts into my investment search process."
2013-08-22 00:17:36,"+1

2013-08-21 12:54:52,Yet it's missing Rosenbaum's [*Investment Banking*](http://www.amazon.com/Investment-Banking-Valuation-Leveraged-Acquisitions/dp/1118656210)
2013-08-21 11:45:08,"If you were dealing with an even smaller cap insurance company, for instance around 500M. Is there any way to tell that if one large event occurs it won't sink the entire company? Or is it basically just gambling once they're that small?"

2013-08-21 09:16:53,"One key factor no one has mentioned is how fast these 20M shares are going to enter the market.  If the partners in China try to sell it all as fast as possible, the stock could easily tank hard.  "
2013-08-21 00:34:34,I'll say it again. I'd follow him into combat. Very eloquently written.
2013-08-20 23:21:45,The combined ratio.  Look it up on Investopedia or somewhere.  It's the go to ratio for the insurance industry.
2013-08-20 22:58:17,"I would put the highest value of Insurance companies on reserves and assets, although they are more complicated to value. If you are looking for a ""ball park"" valuation technique: TANGIBLE B/V as well as EV/EBIT and ROE are good starting points. "
2013-08-20 22:49:47,"lol was just about to post this, long read but worth it. "
2013-08-20 22:01:46,Interesting.  Time to do some research I suppose.
2013-08-20 21:47:56,"Where did the acquirer get the money to buy the target?  Issue equity? Take out a loan?  Who would give them a loan?  What was in it for the Chinese company?  If the only goal was to get listed, the Chinese made a huge mistake."
2013-08-20 21:40:20,"There was no forward P/E multiple before; prior to the acquisition, the company was deeply in the red. The acquired company (FAB, the chinese business) was several times larger and more successful than the acquiring company (Wizzard, an American software company). Now it is a case where the tail is wagging the dog; the American company bought the chinese company and absorbed it (and some of the management). The combined entity (FAB Universal) trades on the american stock exchange (good for the Chinese) and is financially sound (good for the Americans).

The company is offering guidance of roughly $20 million in NI for 2013, and my math agrees with that number. Assuming the milestones are met and the 20 million shares are issued to the chinese, dividing the NI by 40.8 million shares checks out to about $.50 EPS. Not sure how to gauge the P/E multiple, however.

There aren't even any comparable companies to measure against. They're positioning to become the Red Box of china. With some elements of iTunes. And Blockbuster. Trying to bring paid content to the world's most notorious media pirate culture. Media kiosks and memberships fuel the lion's share of revenue right now, but they're starting to open brick and mortar flagship stores for events and signings. They're also the largest podcast distributor by market share (Wizzard's old business), though post-acquisition this is a small fraction of the overall earnings."
2013-08-20 21:16:34,"P/B and P/E are likely the ones to use for an insurance co. P/B shows the expected value of the company vs the current balance sheet value of their insurance portfolio + all their other net assets. P/E gives you a simple multiple on earnings power which is also useful to compare. Usually I prefer to compare ROE over P/E since it shows how much yield you are earning on your equity (how profitable the insurance business is, despite the size of the portfolio).

DCF always works for any company, but it is very assumptive to arrive at an answer so its often easier to use multiples."
2013-08-20 20:53:52,"Correct, I also understood the $ to be a typo.  No it doesn't change anything.  My example was a hypothetical, but since you know the level of dilution, if you have an estimate of the NI of the combined companies which management probably gave if they gave guidance, you should be able to estimate next quarter and a forward 12-month EPS.  If you have some sense of what the forward P/E multiple was prior to the acquisition, your EPS estimate multiplied by the historic forward P/E multiple should give you some sense of how the market will value the shares post-dilution."
2013-08-20 20:02:17,How so?
2013-08-20 20:01:30,"I think the $ sign is a typo on the part of the transcription service. 20.8 million is the current number of shares. 

""So, it won't impact expense, but the shares will grow from the current 20.8 million up to in the 40 some million. That's correct? If milestones are missed.""

Does this change anything?"
2013-08-20 19:35:53,I think it depends on what kind of insurance company it is. Is it a auto/home/life insurer? Is it one of those reinsurers?
2013-08-20 19:34:30,"I've never looked at this business in detail before, but you have to really have to be careful when you have massive revenue growth, moderate EBITDA growth, and EBIT / FCF are negative and progressively getting more negative. Long run I could see these investments potentially building barriers to entry, I'm just scared off by the valuation (and curious what the maintenance capex will be on them)."
2013-08-20 19:04:13,Impact: zero
2013-08-20 17:28:05,"I think this is the line that explains what's going on, but there's some missing information regarding the milestones: "" So, it won't impact expense, but the shares will grow from the current $20.8 million up to in the 40 some million. That's correct? If milestones are missed.""

I interpret from this, that if certain persons within the acquired company hit their expected 'milestones', 20.8 million shares will be issued.

So here's what I would look at: if they hit their milestones, what would be the earnings to the company.  Lets say prior to the acquisition, the acquirer (which you own shares in) had 10 million shares and made 10 million dollars.  This would give them $1.00/share EPS. Let's say the acquired needs to hit

$10,000,000 in NI (scenario 1)

Original NI	Acquired NI	Original NI	New Share Count	EPS	For you

$10,000,000 	$10,000,000 	$20,000,000 	30,000,000	 $0.67 	Bad

$20 million in NI (scenario 2)

Original NI	Acquired NI	Original NI	New Share Count	EPS	For you

$10,000,000 	$20,000,000 	$30,000,000 	30,000,000	 $1.00 	Neutral

$30 million in NI (scenario 3)

Original NI	Acquired NI	Original NI	New Share Count	EPS	For you

$10,000,000 	$30,000,000 	$40,000,000 	30,000,000	 $1.33 	Good

You could also do a sensitivity analysis to see what would happen if they miss their goals.  If the dilution doesn't take place, but they add some incremental income, that would be good for you.
"
2013-08-20 17:21:34,"Shitty back-of-the-envelope math warning:

At 40.8 million shares and the current price, it's still positive. I'm expecting $.50 EPS for 2013 at 40 million shares, showing positive growth towards a higher EPS into 2014. 

10:1 P/E is completely reasonable for a company with this much momentum (though it is a number straight from my rear) and such little debt, which would put it at $5.00 share, above where it is right now by a moderate margin.

All that shitty math is pretty conservative, leaving room for additional upside. Would be totally open for someone to take a look at their reports and tell me I'm dead wrong.

I'm just bummed because at 20m shares, I was conservatively expecting a price of $9.00, and now I don't know if that's in the cards. I don't know what's in the cards."
2013-08-20 17:02:31,"The market should theoretically have already accounted for this event, although that doesn't mean the price won't react to it happening anyways.  Maybe the stock drops 50%, maybe it does nothing, no one can really predict how the market will react to an event that is already considered likely to occur.  What you should be asking yourself is if you still like the stock's valuation when factoring in an additional 20 million shares."

2012-04-21 00:59:56,"I'm being serious. Read the quote below the top comment. A lot of the top investors choose to buy great businesses at a fair price instead of a good business at a discount. 

It most likely has to do with present value analysis where one offers no extra juice of growth and the other offers a lot at a fair price. 

A quote from one of my professors, ""If you follow the book, you will get what you deserve."" From reading your message I can tell you sway on the side of academics which isn't bad, but you can do better. It is important to have good theory. It is also important for the theory to be good practice. 

My question wasn't about utility maximization on the choice of investment theory per say. Although, I admit it does sound like it and theoretically given a basket of choices everyone will have slightly different utility levels or trade offs given a complete information set of every analysis of every possible investment opportunity. I was just trying to figure out a better way of investing.

2012-04-20 17:46:34,"[Here's Buffett talking about earnings yield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a9Lx9J8uSs#t=54m40s). Ben Graham used it too, as does Joel Greenblatt. It's mainly comparing what kind of return you can expect versus a risk free rate.

Buffett also says (I think it's in this same video a little earlier on) that the role of the security analyst is to take a stock, which has an intrinsic value that is not readily apparent, and convert it to a bond, which has an intrinsic value that is right on the face of it. So yeah, Buffett would disagree with the idea that bonds don't have intrinsic value."

2012-04-19 17:54:58,"Banks make money off the spread. They borrow short and lend long. The fed lowers the rates on the short end, the yield curve gets steeper, and this induces banks to lend. It's also the fed giving its blessing to more lending. Conversely, when the fed jacks up rates on the short end enough, you get an inverted yield curve, which is the fed slamming on the brakes. The fed did this in January, 2000, and it finally helped pop the insane nasdaq bubble. You should be aware of the four types of yield curves(normal, steep, flat, inverted) and what they mean for the market. That was the good old days, by the way. Now, with near zero overnight rates, we get operation twist which is weirder. 

Also, this econ series shows some good stuff (episodes 20,21)

http://learner.org/resources/series79.html

edit: I just reviewed the econ series, and it's been changed. They used to have comments on the early eighties crises, and how the fed ""slammed on the brakes so hard, it threw the economy through the windshield"" when they inverted the yield curve then.

You can see how yield curve inversion(spread &lt; 0) correlates closely with recessions here.

2012-04-19 17:44:02,shot in the dark: they are less likely to be cheap?
2012-04-19 17:10:18,"When you use the Graham number, you're basically comparing the price of the stock to an average of P/E and P/B. If you want to know the specific shortcomings of it, look at the shortcomings of the inputs.

P/E isn't great, because a quickly growing company can often deserve a high p/e, hence assuming all companies where (P/E &lt; 15) are cheap ignores their growth rate.

Similarly, P/B suffers because the book value of a company can stray substantially from the replacement value of the firm and not all assets are correctly capitalized from a ""true"" value point of view. For example, if firm A spends a lot of money on R&amp;D and has developed a huge amount of value in patents, those patents won't be on the balance sheet, but if firm B spent no money on R&amp;D and instead spent all that money on acquiring smaller, patent owning companies, those patents would be on the balance sheet in the form of goodwill. So firm B would have a much higher book value, despite the same ""true"" economic value or replacement cost."
2012-04-19 16:54:23,"That actually confuses me...how is it that banks do better business in a low interest vs. high interest environment? 

I can understand the car analogy and that they do *more* business, but wouldn't higher interest rates generate more profit?"
2012-04-19 14:38:20,"Yes, but value investing is not consensus investing. Each investor's risk-return tolerance will differ. Some prefer a Graham/Schloss approach and others will do a Graham/Fisher approach.

I tend towards the latter (buy great businesses at a decent price over decent businesses at a great price) but ideally, in Buffett Munger's preferences as well as mine, the goal is to look for great businesses at great (undervalued) prices. "

2012-04-19 12:57:33,"Excellent article. 

The first thing I do is eliminate countries with lax regulatory situations, where a company can easily misrepresent accounting figures or is not required to disclose important aspects of their business/accounting/financial position."
2012-04-19 11:50:24,"Graham's number comes having Price to Earnings per Share ratio of 15, and Price to Book Value per Share of 1.5 (15*1.5=22.5) and some algebra to solve for Price.

It basically looks for really cheap stocks. For example, Apple's Graham number is $276, and Intel's Graham number is $22. Intel used to trade this low less than a year ago.

Can you point to some of your ""a lot of sources""?"
2012-04-19 10:46:00,"Then you've answered your own question: it's got to be the undervalued one. A fairly priced business would have the value of it's prospects priced in:

""I would sooner buy a great business at a good price than a good business at a great price."" = ""I want to maximise risk adjusted returns.""

""I would sooner buy a fair business at a great price than a great business at a meh price."" = ""I want to maximise risk adjusted returns.""

That's why I asked if ""fair"" and ""undervalued"" are what you really meant - you can only ever know if something is truly fairly priced or undervalued with hindsight. 

If you meant ""looks OK priced"" and ""looks cheaply priced"" then it's a different box of kippers entirely. The general consensus is to go with the better company (the more competent management team). This in turn leads to companies that ""look OK priced"" becoming overpriced (again, something you can only know in hindsight) and the ""looks cheaply priced"" staying cheap. Then eventually this happens:

Also, investors poured into utilities last year as a safe haven and for dividend returns. This might have served as an early warning. "

2012-04-17 09:56:17,"Cornerbodega is close but not exactly correct.

The Tyco scandal back in 2002 was actually related to the CEO and General Counsel illegally borrowing money from the company at very low interest rates, selling stock without informing shareholders and a few other questionable management actions.  They were eventually convicted following a trial.

The investigation into Tyco originally was related to the many acquisitions the company was making.  When ""financial shenanigans"" refers to ""dwindling reserves"" they are talking about a couple of things.  

The first is sometimes referred to as ""spring-loading"" whereby management understates the earnings of a recently acquired company in order to optically show an earnings boost in future quarters.  Management can do this by including integration costs into line items like SG&amp;A or COGS.  Companies are suppose to include the costs associated with the acquisition as part of the cost of the acquisition.  Reserves, in this case, are related to the rate at which integration costs were rolling off (i.e. reducing expenses) which clearly results in an increase in earnings.

The second, although less important in this case, is referring to the purchase of Net Operating Losses that can be used to avoid taxes.

There's only 2 real ways of ever making money from a stock: dividends and takeovers.  The fake way is the pyramid scheme of selling out your shares to people who hopefully anticipate future dividends or takeout offers.  The purpose of these new shares is for founders to cash out their holdings (selling non voting shares) without ever having to issue dividends or agree to sell the company.

I've read through their annual 10-K statement to see what may change their profitability. It is indeed anything that can affect their crops/orders or rising costs. These issues should be inverse to UVV, as rising costs for transport/seed/pesticides will benefit these providers and hurt UVV. Other factors include the U.S. currency, weather, and customer's ability to pay (credit).

2012-05-21 23:16:27,Thank you for the suggestion. I agree with you that the most obviously underpriced securities most likely offer the greatest margin of safety because they are so obviously underpriced. In other words a large mispricing is both obvious and offers a large margin of safety.
2012-05-21 21:37:19,"Firm valuation is somewhat arbitrary, although there are clearly some widely accepted methods used throughout industry. A combination of some kind of discounted cash flow method n comparable analysis usually works best.

However, i think it's important to recognize that valuation should involve as few assumptions as possible - in order to gain confidence that you are in fact correct.

For example, let's take IBM vs Microsoft. Both are huge companies, look relatively inexpensive to fairly valued on a DCF and comparable basis.  Yet, I view both very differently from an investment perspective. 

IBM lays out a 5 year plan explaining exactly how you, as a shareholder, will earn a return. They do this by deploying a total shareholder yield strategy (dividends + buy backs) equal to apprx 50% of the companies market cap. I.e a return of 10% per year. If you look back historically, this total shareholder yield perfectly reflected the performance in the companies stock. Again, I'm emphasizing that a shareholder understands where they earn their return.

Microsoft, on the other hand, offers nothing to help investors understand where their return comes from.  The company plows money into money losing investments - bing, Xbox, etc.  As a result, its very difficult to value their cash generation since, unlike IBM, the money never ends up in your pocket.

My point, in summary, is too spend more time understanding how $1 of sales (or $1 raised in an IPO) flows through the business, how the money generated is going to be used and, most importantly, how it will ultimately end up in your pocket.

The Voodoo associated with most valuation tools often leads people to poor investments. Make sure you understand the business economics fist before using cookie cutter valuation models. "
2012-05-21 20:41:45,"This is essentially a variation on the free cash flow calculation, which has a similar number of steps, but is rarely provided directly by reporting companies."
2012-05-21 20:39:44,"&gt; he hardest part I am finding is during the balance-sheet analysis, is how to properly value intangible assets. I usually wind up simply discounting the book value by 25-30% and calling it a day, but that seems unreasonable.

It can be ok to value it in a range from 0 to something.  The 0 value is acceptable because it will be reflected in the company's earnings and earnings power.

Brand value and name recognition can be worth something, but that something can be worthless if the company is becoming obsolete, and the something is subjectively different to any potential acquirer.

I assume here that you add that in as a ""cash expense"" even though it isn't a cash outlay?"
2012-05-21 20:24:50,"I liked that idea.  Seems specific to netflix a bit.

There is no real argument to a well managed company being one that stonewalls its suppliers.  

While, it is possible for a company to increase sales by offering longer less favourable AR terms, its never a core strategic strength, and it is an impermanent advantage or disadvantage."
2012-05-21 19:41:21,"My suggestion is to keep it as simple as possible.  What you're really after is situations where securities are obviously mispriced.  If I have to go through all those steps you outlined to see that a security isn't fairly priced, it's not obvious enough to be worthwhile.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying that there are no points awarded for style in investing.  "
2012-05-21 19:26:26,"My reasoning is increases in AP could be viewed as ""screwing over suppliers to help your bottom line"" and decreases in AR can be indicative of slowing sales rather than ""increased collections"". I don't buy the argument that AR collections can increase by a truly significant amount from one year to the next. I think large changes in AR are more indicative of having clients whose cash flows are volatile, therefore you get paid when cash flow is good for them and vice versa.
  
The 2% is arbitrary, you're right. I will try thinking of a better way to determine that rate. (I don't quite buy the CAPM/WACC) "
2012-05-21 19:06:49,"Why do increases in AP and decreases in AR count as ""poor"" quality cash flows? Any FCF valuation uses working capital as an input.

2012-05-19 01:41:06,banker fees as part of an offering are hitting APIC (negative capitalization...?). This isnt amortized. 
2012-05-19 00:01:53,"Hm, I am not sure if you understand where SBC comes from. Your comparison to depreciation is not exactly the best because you have an outlay for an asset which you have use of over time.

SBC such as options, is not really a true cost to the Company. It sets a strike price and it vests. Lets say the strike is $1 or whatever the close of the market the day of grant...there is no cost to the Company to issue this share either way. However it is consideration to an employee in that it is valuable because if you're in the money you can take your option and profit the difference. But to the issuing company it makes no difference just diluting as Godspiral mentioned.

GAAP has either black scholes or binomial lattice to value options based on a number of options to try and represent the expense (value per share granted) of granting SBC in that period even though it will take time to vest (often 1 year cliff, then monthly vesting...).

You know about back dating options? It makes no difference to the Company in 'real' money/expense. However, it benefits the employee greatly because it was back dated to a lower strike price. So basically it 'cheats' whoever buys the share the employee subsequently sells.

2012-05-18 18:28:57,"Non GAAP earnings and estimates is in my opinion a major scam used to inflate perceived stock value.

A more important point than what you mentioned regarding stock based compensation, is that in addition to a charge in acquiring revenue, it is a direct cost to shareholders who are diluted as a result.  LNDK or CRM have both very high stock based comp because they are both managment focused piggy banks.

As an analyst this is partially correctable by forecasting expected shareholder dilution in addition to earnings.

In the case of LNKD, there is also substantial reported depreciation and amortization which is not obviously understandable from the nature of its business.  If the number reflects past computer/server infrastructure on an unusually long amortization schedule it should be reported because they are relevant past expenses and likely requiring future updates.  If they are the result of substantial investment banking fees/slush fund, they should disclose when those expire.  Basically, when a DA amount is large and opaque, I feel it requires disclosure details before it can be considered irrelevant to analysis, instead of just assuming away an accounting formality that will not affect future cashflows."

Personally, I try to invest in companies with free cash flow yields of 10% or higher. That's an indication that the market doesn't expect any future growth from the company. Any growth that does occur will cause the market to revalue the stock at a lower yield, which means a higher price."
2012-05-16 20:07:59,"increase your discount rate by X%, where X is your level of margin of safety.
  
if the market prices a share using a 10% discount rate, you should double that rate to 20% if your aim is to have a 50% margin of safety."
2012-05-16 17:00:29,"I thought justification for the margin of safety came from the uncertainty of future events, and from errors in judgement and calculation.

Can you clarify what you mean by ""The Market misvalues cash flows on both the long and the short side""? I'm not exactly sure what that means. And how would the margin of safety apply to this scenario?
"
2012-05-16 16:42:38,"Well from what I understand, buying at a price with the Margin of Safety applied is meant to decrease downside risk. Having this provides room for error in the analyst's judgement. In addition, it provides for the uncertainty of an event that can cause a permanent loss of realized capital such as the deterioration of the fundamentals of a company. 

When we apply a margin of safety to a stock, we are admitting that there are these other risks involved. And with a margin of safety applied to the intrinsic value, it's similar to using a higher discount rate to determine at what price to buy. 

So I was thinking about finding a way to mathematically reconcile the margin of safety with a discount rate just for intellectual curiosity. 

From what I concluded mathematically, applying the margin of safety after finding the intrinsic value is similar to using twice the discount rate and twice the growth rate. Both methods come to the same price at which it is ""safe"" under value investing methodology to buy.

So from the fact that you, a conservative investor, would have to wait for an investment to have a large enough margin of safety, you essentially would be waiting for the Market to perceive that investment as twice as risky before you can buy. Correct? 


"
2012-05-16 14:57:39,"When I see justifications for margin of safety in investments, the discount rate often does not come into play.  Most people I know somewhat punt on the discount rate question by using CAPM or a heuristic based on how risky they feel the company is.

Justifications for margin of safety often come from misvaluing assets or cashflows.  If you look at Bill Ackman's investments, he often finds misvalued assets in companies that are better valued by the market after spinoffs (GGP, WEN, BEAM, etc.).  You can also see this same effect in Jana Partners valuation of Barnes &amp; Noble and how the stock rallied after the Microsoft investment.

The market misvalues cash flows on both the long and the short side as well.  The market did not take into account NFLX's changing cost structure and increased competition until last summer which made it a good short.  For STX, the market underestimated earnings growth due to decreased competition due to tsunamis and mergers."
2012-05-16 12:35:01,"You have it backwards, the market actually deems the cash flows less risky than you do. 

If cash flows are $100 in perpetuity, and the stock is trading at $1000 per share, the market is assigning a 10% required rate of return to those cash flows. This rate is essentially the cost to reimburse shareholders for the risk they assume.
  
That is, $100/.10 = $1000/share
  

However as a conservative investor, you are only willing to pay $500 per share. Therefore you are assigning a required rate of return of 20% to that $100 perpetual cash flow. 
  
That is, $100/.20 = $500/share
  
The reason your required rate is higher than the market's is because you deem the stock riskier than the market (hence your margin of safety)."

2012-05-15 23:16:41,"Price to book value is most useful in a liquidation scenario. It provides a (very) rough estimate of what would be left for shareholders after all liabilities are paid. 

Pitney Bowes is not liquidating, so it is more appropriate to estimate its value using expected earnings or cash flows. The company trades at only 3.5 times last year's free cash flow, which seems to indicate a screaming value. However, their is a lot of uncertainly over whether the company will be able to maintain this cash flow as businesses shift away from physical mail.

If revenue does decline to the point where the company cannot turn a profit, a liquidation scenario might come into play. As you pointed out, the company has little in the way of equity so shareholders would likely receive next to nothing in a liquidation. This may be why the company sells so cheaply compared to its historical free cash flow."

Edit: OK, maybe not a fair reply...

""Maybe I am pessimistic but I have a hard time beliving a single individual could do a better weather analysis when there are so many experienced teams out there with a lot of money riding on the outcomes.""

This kind of statement is indicative of the stupidity that I exploit in people to make money.  By that I'm not necessarily saying you're stupid, I'm just saying this is a red flag for it.  (We all do and say dumb things at times.)

This statement is equivalent, in my mind, to ""there's no way someone can beat the lotto,"" or ""the markets are efficient, there's no way a single person can outperform your typical mutual fund.""  Yet statements like these are proven wrong, repeatedly, by people like me.  Why?  It comes down to probability theory and central limits.  Briefly, the central limit theorem says that when lots of a particular thing happen, the outcome data will fit into a bell curve, meaning the average is ""normal,"" and the farther you go outside the average (normal), the faster the chance of that happening is zero.  (It's never absolutely zero, but it's clearer if you think about outliers in this way.)

The problem is that Finance doesn't work this way.  We don't see normal bell-shaped distributions in economic systems; instead, we see something called fat-tailed curves, meaning things that aren't supposed to happen do indeed happen, and they happen with regularity.

Now, why does this happen?  It's because humans interact with these economic systems and humans are imperfect; hence, they introduce inefficiency.

So let's say, with some certainty, that inefficiency exists in just about everything having to do with money.  That doesn't mean you can perceive the inefficiency per se, but let's say it's there (so we never get to being lazy and thinking that it's not).  Let's ASSUME it's there.  If it is there, where would we look?  Well, I'd begin by looking at parts of that system that people believe are efficient.  Why?  Because people believe them to be efficient and people, as I mentioned, are imperfect.  The best sources of investment ideas come from going against the consensus.  People dismiss this as contrarian investing, but that's not entirely accurate.  It's about exploiting stupidity.  It's the same as when your third grade teacher put a big red X on a math problem and warned you about making careless mistakes: I punish people for making mistakes like that as adults. 

Look, I know you're fishing for answers.  Not just any kind of answers, but the kind of answers that people without money try to take from people with money.  So, instead of telling you that I did indeed answer the original question AS A FAVOR TO YOU, a stranger, and that this new question has little to do with the original, I'm going to give you the best answer possible: do your own work.

Investors come in two forms: those who do work, and those who don't.  That's it.  The guys that do the work come up with the ideas, and the guys who don't do the work try to copy those ideas.  Now the problem with this is the same as in science: you don't know if the original work can be trusted.  You don't know if the data is fraudulent.  You don't know how each party is incentivized.  That's why people who don't do their own work are disadvantaged and always will be.

If you want to raise money, do your own work and figure it out yourself.  Be creative.  For myself, I know I can walk into any room in the world and get people interested in my fund.  Why?  Because I did the work and talked to thousands upon thousands of people in my lifetime.

Do your own work.  Figure out your own ideas.  Follow your own leads.  Pursue every last detail if for no other reason than your family depends on the money you make and you have an obligation to them to leave nothing to chance.  This is the whole point of security analysis, the whole point of investing in one asset over any other.

The Futures market is not gambling.  It's a tool, actually -- a financial device.  If your analyses are correct, it is one tool by which you can use to leverage your investment and increase your returns.  Likewise, investing in currencies is not gambling, at least, not with good analysis.

A good trading idea works like this: you figure out what's going to happen, then you figure out how best to exploit that.  For instance, if there's a temporal bound to your analysis of a company, you might want to invest in an option instead of the common stock.  Likewise, if you do weather pattern analysis and see that there WON'T be an early frost in South America as everyone predicts, you might sell coffee futures instead of shorting Starbucks.  You're squeezing the most value out of your research, and none of it has to do with gambling -- none.

Edit: changed ""will be an early frost"" to WON'T, as in, if no early frost comes, coffee will be in ready supply and prices will drop; hence, you want to sell the futures."

2012-05-07 17:41:46,"If I had to start from absolute zero, I would work at White Castle (side note: I always wanted to work at White Castle and serve someone a hamburger with a thousand patties inside) save up a $1000, then break a lotto game.  Beating lotto systems was one of my earliest investment ideas because it was cheap to do and the returns usually exceed 1000%.

Beating lotto games is not a scalable idea, so it will not help you raise money for a fund.  I'm a stock picker, essentially, and I'd have to do that concurrently with some budgeting (meaning some profits would be allocated to lotto, some to options and stocks, and some to overhead), because that is a scalable idea.

After two or three years, I would start a new fund (it's too expensive to start a fund earlier than this if you have no money) and raise capital using my tax returns for the last couple of years.

Now beating lotto games is not the only way to generate returns like this.  I've seen guys do it trading currencies, commodities, penny stocks, futures, and other highly-leveraged instruments.  The idea is that you want to get to 1% of your targeted fund size as quickly as possible.

The other way to do it is to take a really good trading idea, put on a suit and start networking the idea of starting a fund to someone that will bankroll you.  It would be similar to starting a business.  It has to be a really solid investment idea, though.  And you need to show why you're the guy that should do it (and not they themselves)."

2012-05-07 03:09:16,"I run an investment advisory firm, also known as a hedge fund.  The fund uses an event-driven, special situations value approach, focusing primarily on equity and equity-related securities.  My official title is ""managing member,"" but no one uses titles at the office.  We are all equal, meaning all our ideas and objections are listened to with the same consideration friends give each other in a thoughtful discussion.

Work is seven days a week throughout the year.  It ends when I need to sleep or eat or have sex.  I love working and I love doing it all the time.  Most of the time I'm reading research or SEC filings or scientific papers.  Sometimes I'm on Reddit -- I use it to review news and ideas at times, actually (not investing ideas per se, but let's say there's a piece of research that I have that I want to know more about -- Reddit is, genuinely, a good place to go to learn things of that nature on the internet).  Because I run the firm I'm also networking all the time, to raise funds.  I go to clubs and events as often as possible.

My advice for those breaking into Finance is to do the Goldman training program.  Everyone will tell you that Goldman's training is just like everyone else's training, but that's not true.  You do it for the pedigree.  You do it so you can say ""Goldman picked me,"" and Goldman only picks a certain type of person to do their program.

That said, if you wanted to work for someone like me, here's what you need:
a) Solid investment ideas.  At least three when you come in for an interview.  My fund did 84% last year; entirely from my picks.  Show me how you're going to beat my numbers.  Be prepared to explain yourself thoroughly.

b) Show me your transcripts.  I want to see a 4.0 gpa or something close to it.  I don't care about who you know or what you've done because my specialty is gaming systems that suffer from hubris or stupidity -- references mean little to me.  Show me proof that you can work extremely hard on something for an incredibly long time.  A 4.0 shows me you know how to work all night to get something right.

c) Explain your investment philosophy to me.  Everyone has one.  You can usually tell when someone is stupid just by listening to how they plan to invest their money.

And that's really it.  If I know you can make money, I know you'll pay your own salary, so there's little risk on my side in hiring you.  I know lots of value shops that think exactly this way when hiring.

Finally, if you're not interested in working for a value fund, beyond the Goldman training, you should think about joining some kind of society or fraternity.  I've seen that help lots of people get jobs in Finance. "

2012-05-05 18:18:59,I'm glad someone had this information handy. Kudos. 
2012-05-05 17:12:52,"Check out pages 18 - 21 from the [2008 annual report](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2008ar/2008ar.pdf) for more details.  

*We have added modestly to the “equity put” portfolio I described in last year’s report. Some of our contracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty at maturity if the reference index to which the put is tied is then below what it was at the inception of the contract. Neither party can elect to settle early; it’s only the price on the final day that counts.To illustrate, we might sell a $1 billion 15-year put contract on the S&amp;P 500 when that index is at, say, 1300. If the index is at 1170 – down 10% – on the day of maturity, we would pay $100 million. If it is above 1300, we owe nothing. For us to lose $1 billion, the index would have to go to zero. In the meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium – perhaps $100 million to $150 million – that we would be free to invest as we wish. Our put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four major indices: the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., the FTSE 100 in the U.K., the Euro Stoxx 50 in Europe, and the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Our first contract comes due on September 9, 2019 and our last on January 24, 2028.*

Even if the puts expire out of the money, it is unlikely that Berkshire will lose any money on them because he can invest the large premium he received for writing the puts in the interim (12 - 20 years).  "

Once again, I'm going to repeat my comment from a previous post:
You should provide some analysis of your own for people to follow up with and comment on. [Look at what bigwoody did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/p333a/energy_stock_manifesto/) or [what Coldheat did here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/qadv8/btctake_a_look_and_tell_me_what_you_think/).

Providing a brief analysis (no matter how incomplete) gives people incentive to contribute and critique through commentary. This facilitates a more meaningful discussion which is encouraged in r/SecurityAnalysis.

Even though you can't contribute analysis now, you can always contribute good questions.  SamGill asks good questions and posts articles from time to time.  Another thing that you can do is post an analysis of GLW that someone else has done and ask questions about it in the comments.  Many of the articles I post are analyses done by other people.  It helps me learn new ways of valuing companies and it is interesting to see other peoples' perspectives.

I see any of the options above as better than random discussion and all of these are things you can do today.

2012-10-22 19:22:32,"I'm not quite sure where you get $620M (I'm assuming you mean the premium paid for the acquisition in which case I get a slightly different number), but the short answer is no, you won't necessarily see that decline.  The easiest reason is because XOM is so large, $620M doesn't even constitute a full percentage point of their MV, so any effect would be drowned out by normal trading.  Additionally, this premium, if justified by management, may be a good decision.  It's recorded as goodwill (an asset) and its acquisition should be evaluated no differently than the acquisition of any other asset.  If the price was right, then it was a good deal. "

"
2012-10-17 02:42:52,Thanks for writing this down.
2012-10-17 01:42:05,"The Good - What OP said. This company looks fantastic if you only look at the accounting. Although, I don't agree that QSII will be acquired; these companies tend not to have IP or worthwhile physical assets. Company acquisition would only be for customer acquisition, but the only buyer I can imagine is CERN, and I just don't see them going for it.



The Bad - Once you look at the business and industry, it paints a clearer picture of why the stock has performed so poorly since the end of 2011


*Dissident board member 

There is this Ahmed Hussein guy who, like OP said, owns a huge portion of the company. This guy is a real class act; for the last several years he has done everything in his power to make operations difficult. He doesn't attend meetings when he is required, sign paperwork, and just generally tries to mess things up. In order to solve this, the other board members have been hoarding seats and issuing options to everyone BUT him, perhaps an attempt at dilution. A few months ago Hussein used his QSII position for leverage and got margin called during a lockout period. Usually this would be grounds for getting kicked out of his board seat, but who knows if it will happen.


*Lack of Talent

A friend of mine is the owner and CEO of a competitor; he gave me a really good insight to the problems many companies in this industry are facing at the moment. In January 2012 a new set of standards for medical billing and reporting went into effect. Most of the companies in the industry had spent the last several years employing average programmers to maintain software that had been developed years ago. Couple this with the fact that the new billing system isn't much better than the old one, and you can guess how things went down - chaos. Virtually no one could keep up with the updates (well, CERN did OK). When a hospital can't get their software to work, they can't wait until next week; they need it now. Many customers switched services and some of QSII's smaller peers didn't make it. QSII has enough money that this shouldn't have been a problem, and the fact that it is, is a sign of poor management.


Conclusion:

The company looks good on paper, maybe the Hussein problem will go away soon and maybe QSII will get the new Obamacare system down. For now, I'm watching for a safe opportunity to enter, but currently the risk is beyond my tolerance.

2012-10-16 23:21:00,"If you've followed the story behind SODI this is quite an encouraging sign for shareholders. The company was essentially a net-net with a few majority shareholders, one of who was the CEO and was mismanaging cash as well as providing little useful information to minority shareholders. Returning cash and finally holding an annual meeting are steps in the right direction.
  
Regarding buybacks vs dividends I agree with you in some circumstances. In this case I'm unsure who sold: my guess it was mostly the majority shareholders but that is a blind guess as I think the activist minority shareholders were unaware."
2012-10-16 22:38:59,"Usually conglomerates report their division earnings in their 10-K or 10-Q filings. And when a company considers a spin off, they must provide what the earnings would have been if they were run separately.

Price multiple or P/E is estimated based on what similar company is valued by the market currently. For divisions within the company, P/E would be estimated as if they were their own company. This is why spin-offs happen. Greenblatt says a lot about this in his ""Stock Market Genius"" book.

Thus, (expected true value) = (earnings1) * (expected P/E of Div1) + (earnings2) * (expected P/E of Div2). "

The long term leases definitely provide a better buffer than in the shipping industry, but contracts can still be broken if rates tumble.

2012-10-16 17:12:52,"Commoditized businesses like this tend to do amazing when demand is rising since increasing supply takes a long lead time. On the other side, oversupply caused by new orders using debt financing or a demand shock can wreak havoc on these industries. Undersupply tends to correct a lot faster than oversupply.

Recently, this has played out in the similar industry of drybulk shipping. During a peak profit period, all the players decided to take out loans and order new ships. Demand still grew, but it didn’t keep pace with the new supply. Lease rates plummeted and the companies had difficulties keeping up with interest payments. Most drybulk companies now trade at small fractions of their book value which has hurt value investors. This company has a high debt ratio and low times interest earned, so it could be susceptible to a similar fate.

Do you see any chance of a similar situation playing out in the airplane leasing industry? I’m curious of how the industry did during the 9/11 demand shock."

2012-10-15 14:44:22,"I checked their financials and read their most recent 10-Q this morning. Revenue is obviously down however I did note this line in the 10-Q's MD&amp;A:
  
""We have received additional orders from Raytheon Company during the first nine months of fiscal 2012 for our high speed bulk encryptors as part of a Patriot Missile upgrade program in Taiwan amounting to $1.2 million. This order is expected to ship over the next 12 months.""
  
Revenue is recognized as follows: ""Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, *delivery of the product to the customer has occurred* and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable.""
  
So it looks like that revenue will be recognized over the next year which is a good sign. 
  
Additionally I didn't seen signs of  mismanagement either. Although I will take a closer look at their stock option and exec. compensation before I invest.
  
Their R&amp;D and Marketing spend is up as well...Overall I think this is a play on whether that spend increase can translate into sales or not. However if they can maintain a base of sales (even at a lower level), the cash/marketable securities will provide a downside cushion. I think more historical analysis is necessary to determine how well they manage cash. 
  
If they can translate their increased investment into more sales, I agree that there is an opportunity here for asymmetrical returns."
2012-10-15 01:28:44,sent... thanks man
2012-10-14 21:24:53,"You’re right, that number is absolutely not trustworthy and the large discount rate used may still be too lenient. However, while domestic sales have been dropping dramatically, foreign sales have been rising modestly. Most of those sales have been to middle east countries where geopolitical risk is still increasing. It may be too optimistic, but I do believe the company will be able to replace the large 10 million dollar contracts with the government with smaller 1 million dollar contracts elsewhere. This is speculative but this analysis is based on a margin of safety provided by liquid current assets, hence the possibility of asymmetric returns.

I have a positive view on management. When the current CEO took the job in 1998, he owned 11.0% of the company and his base salary was $199,680. In the most recent year of 2011, he owned 16.8% of the company and his base salary was $270,005. This was a 35% increase in salary over a period of time when the tangible book value of the company increased by 42%. Bonuses have been tied to performance goals that include profit targets, backlog targets, and the finding of strategic investments. In the most recent year, the CEO received $87,750 which represents 65% of the total possible bonus pool if all goals were met. Recent large stock option awards have had exercise prices in excess of $9.00 and vest in 20% chunks over the next five years.

In answer to your question, I don't see evidence of management enriching themselves at the cost of shareholders. In recent years administrative expenses have decreased while marketing and R&amp;D expenses have increased. I feel the greater danger of value destruction is that these investments by management in finding new products and markets may fail."
2012-10-14 01:55:25,"Initial concern: you quote average 8 years of historical sales, but the US has been at wars for about that time frame. As you said with the war winding down, what makes that number trustworthy?
  
Additionally, what is your opinion of management? My other concern is they will be enriching themselves with current assets as the business potentially winds down. Do you see any evidence of this?"

2012-10-12 01:18:47,"As far as I can remember (2000-ish) they always seem to make technologically poor choices, as if the management knows the capabilities, but not the limitations, of the various technologies. They are always under-investing in infrastructure, which disappoint customers, and higher churn. Then they go after low-income customers. Their Nextel merger brought in business customers, but most were in the construction with their iDEN push-to-talk capability. Now they are trying to be a virtual operator, reselling their service to Virgin, which was a great deal for Virgin, but not so much for Sprint.

Basically, I think Sprint suffers from poor management, trying to operate a very capital intensive and competitive business---aka a bottomless money pit.

Chinese inflation lately is ~ 2%, down from 6% a year ago. This should induce the Chinese to print money. So, the central banks are in a highly stimulative mode, which should favor cyclicals and industrials, especially since they are trading at very reasonable multiples. 

Here's a video in which a Japanse economist predicts money printing by the BOJ. Makes sense because if the Yen continues to strengthen, Japanese exports would be in a lot of trouble.

In this era of ever decreasing returns (and I'm not talking about the crisis in the last few years, but about the future at large) I need as much of an edge as I can get. I don't want to work one minute more than necessary!

As for Black-Scholes, I'm not interested in derivatives. I'm not interested in accurateness either. I prefer good, scientifically validated, simple heuristics that give me some insight.

I agree that lack of data can be a problem, however."

The thing about investing is that economics is very hard to model,  due to lack of accurate data and the amount of noise in the system (I'm reading Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver, and he goes into some of this in the financial system).

2012-11-17 22:02:01,"Warren Buffet has said that when he started out, he had more ideas than money, so he kept on switching from good idea to an even better one. Then he realized that his best idea is so much better than his 5th best idea. Now he suggests that imagine having 20 tickets to buy stocks **for the rest of your life**, which allowed him to concentrate his portfolio and achieve huge returns. You can read all of this at buffetfaq.

I used to feel the same way (more ideas than money, keep switching securities for a better deal). Now I realize how much wisdom Buffet is just giving away. 

I have a custom stock screener that scraped yahoo finance to show me stocks I would be interested in. But in the end, my best ideas came from just reading the news. 

If you read, and keep abreast of the market, opportunities will come along. Maybe not once a month, but often enough. And these days of market fear (about Europe and the US fiscal cliff), this is doubly true. Warren Buffet reads 5 news papers because the best deals are already in the news. Another Buffetism: Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.

For example, AAPL is now trading at 12x P/E, and paying a 2% dividend. The market is basically saying that Target is a better business than Apple, which I can dispute with any valuation metric. 

Another way to find investing ideas besides the news is to keep abreast of what other value investors are buying. What WB bought is always on the news. Gurufocus has a list of stocks that value investors bought, but has fallen since. 

Good luck.

The only accounting book you need: *Why Stocks Go Up and Down* by Pike. It's out of print, so hard to come by, but I've seen them in libraries."
2012-11-16 20:23:57,"An equally big question is whether the $270/sf is artificially low. The way I see it, the new store will create an entirely new atmosphere that may not achieve its full effect until the transition is 95+% done. Of course the full effect may be terrible, but I don't think it will be. Ron Johnson has shown he's willing to make changes to the plan if he needs to. 

Additionally, it's tough to get people to shop in a store that is under construction, in one form or another, for 3+ years. 

Another question is about the brands jcp partners with. I am a little surprised that Joe Fresh and Disney have been the main talking points for months, or at least the former has. If they are going to open 30 more shops in 12 months from now, then they need to partner with 5 brands every 2 months - which doesn't seem like it's been happening (and that's being generous because it takes a while to build a new brand's shop).  


 


"
2012-11-16 19:44:29,"&gt;If you say there is no numeric price to a company, how can you decide if its current price is high or low?

This is probably what Ben Graham calls ""margin of safety"" in investing. 

It's not that you don't know for sure the price of a security, it's that nobody **can't** know the price. By Occam's razor, that's the same as saying a security doesn't really have a price. Just put the odds on your side as much as you can. You are dealing with probabilities.

&gt;But the most impotent thing is I WANT to.

You mean ""important""? This is a great realisation. That your brain wiring tells you to ""bet"". That's why so many traders lose money. They don't know that their brain wiring is not rational. You have to fight your impulses and do something only if you can rationally can back up your decision.

Lastly, some people do beat the market by trading (trading in the short term I mean). However, while if you do not trade you can prevent yourself from earning money is also true that you certainly prevent yourself from losing money if you do not have the right skills. Hence, not trading is a good heuristic. It is not that you shouldn't trade to earn higher returns. Is that if you stop yourself from trading you raise your odds of not losing money because you reduce your universe of actions to other methods that stack the odds of better returns and less risk on your side.

You don't need to have an extraordinary intelligence to earn good returns. You, unless the majority of people, just need to have the autocontrol to not fuck up.

In the words of Blaise Pascal ""All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone."". Apply that to the investor part of your life."

they essentially buy cobalt and uses the gamma-radiation which the cobalt emits to sterilize food, food packaging, and medical devices.
  
they recently bought a huge batch of cobalt. the timing of it is accelerated: they usually purchase cobalt every 3-4 years, this purchase comes 2 years after their previous purchase. why is that? is it because they are expecting more business? did something happen to their old supply of cobalt? is their supplier going out of business and they are trying to get as much as they can, while they can?

Probably not, hence Wrigleys being a good investment by its nature. On the other hand, all technologies have a shorter life: think of the declline of Kodak in recent years. Who doesn't use a digital camera nowadays?

You still have to read the statements to understand what's going on, however. It would be kind of crazy not analising the annual statements before investing in a company.

Honestly, you say you feel stuck but if you have read all that and know that you shouldn't trade, that the ups and downs of the market are meaningless and that index investing is sensible, you are never going to lose money in the long run.

numbers can differ if some or the providers haven't updated to the latest reported numbers so the Trailing Twelve Month numbers are over a different period. also some data can just be wrong. i don't use EPS as a filter b/c it is fairly arbitrary, i would use revenue or profit as a whole.

Once I use a screener (i screen by VERY basic metrics P/B, dividends, Revenue, Earnings) and have my 100 or so companies i start going 1 by 1 and looking at their publicly available reports. I don't look at anything else until I've read financial statements and MD&amp;A. DO NOT TRUST other peoples metrics. The only reliable source of information in my opinion is financial statements from SEDAR (in canada) and from the SEC in the states.

Yes, this means i calculate all the information I want by hand and Yes it does take hours/days/weeks.

That means that they're not adding $270, they're eliminating $130 and replacing it with $270 for a net benefit of $140/SF.  I suppose they could be using their floor space more efficiently, but they never talk about that.  The efficiencies are coming much more from cost savings.

A big question is whether the $270/SF is artificially high, since the 10% of brands they've launched are the biggest earners.  If that's the case, the $270 should settle in somewhere lower, but still hopefully higher than the $130."

2012-11-14 10:22:39,"I think that knowing accounting is, using investing parlance, the ""catalyst"" for successful investing  once you have the right mindset. Then you can tell if that company meets the criteria you are looking for.

Here goes something you might want to look for in a company: I was reading ""the snowball"" recently and WB says that they should look for a company that passes the 10 year test: pick a company and imagine the market will be closed for 10 years, which one do you go for? Pick a company with such a moat that the economic forces of capitalism will take longer to erode. Couple that with another WB motto: ""what is wise at one price is dumb at another"". Bam! You now know the right company, then wait for the right price.

Having said that, there probably are many ways of successful investing, WB's is just one."
2012-11-14 10:12:46,"In my view, the two absolute main things you want to consider when deciding what to buy are 1) future earnings and 2) the current price you have to pay for those future earnings.  The rest are just tidbits that help you figure out if today's price is a bargain for a share of those future earnings.  So look at what the company is making now, and how much of it, and how much it is earning on what it makes. Have revenues been growing year after year? Do people seem to like the product and it seems likely the company will continue to sell more and more?  Are there other applications for their product that would lead to more sales in the future?  Will there be more competition in the future that will hurt their ability to sell for a decent profit?  All of this is why investing is more of an art than a science; none of this is already known or can possibly be known.  But if you think future earnings will be higher than what the crowd thinks, and the stock has a decent forward p/e and p/b, meaning you can buy at a discount to what the stock is currently worth, then it may be a good idea to buy.  But you have to be vigilant, and an unbiased observer.  You CANNOT be a cheerleader for the stock, and it's safer to assume the analysts are right unless you have very good reason to think they are wrong.  After all, it's their job to monitor these companies, and they put more time into it than you do.  Look at their reasoning and find the flaw, and constantly second-guess yourself until you feel confident you're right.  "
2012-11-14 09:51:37,"Well, I'll first point out that there are dozens/hundreds of investment strategies that you can pick up if you do about an hour of research.  This should tell you that there's no solid ""best approach"" method to investing.  Investing is like poker in that outcomes are affected by both luck and materially significant facts that you simply won't know when you're placing your bets. Unlike poker, however, there is not theoretical ""best play"" where you can prove mathematically that in a given situation a particular play has the highest expected value.  (This fails in poker at the highest levels as well.)

I believe there are two methods of investing that are sustainable over the long term, that are likely to perform acceptably over time.  The first method is to build a portfolio that approximates market performance with low transaction costs; the second is to find inexpensive companies with a high probability of increasing in value and invest in those.

The first case is covered by all the Bogle books/forums/etc.  Research shows that most funds/investors fail to outperform the market, so guaranteeing market performance minus a small fraction of a point is a reasonable approach for most people.  The best thing about this system is that it's frigging automatic: you assess your abilities and interests, determine you probably can't outperform the market (and don't want to invest a part-time job's worth of effort into the attempt), so you build a simple investment strategy that requires no monitoring and that you only need to revisit every year (for re-allocating from one part of your portfolio to another.)  At the end of the decade, you didn't blow the market away but you did better than most and with no ulcers or effort.

The other approach that seems to work consistently over time is value investing.  In this approach you *can* outperform the market significantly, but to do so you'll need to be literate with business and accounting (as in, I got the equivalent of a BS in Accounting after I finished my MBA because I wasn't comfortable with my ability to read financial statements) which will require training, and you'll need to research the companies you want to invest in.  

Even worse: if you're doing it right then you'll be considering making serious bets on companies that are out of favor.  Companies that are clearly blemished (and possibly broken in some way) that everyone you know will tell you to avoid.  You not only have to be competent, you need to have the courage to back up your convictions, and you might need to wait years for your assessments to be proven correct while the market works against you and all your friends who jumped on the Apple bandwagon watched their investment double again.

Value investing requires analytic and emotional skills that most investors don't have.  But it works if you take a long enough view of the market.

And investing using indexes is easier and less stressful by a long shot.  And it might still outperform what you can do on your own."

As for myself, for this reason, I just stick to an index fund. In the past even without knowing accounting it was easy to see you should go all in in some companies at around March 2009, so I jumped in and doubled my money easily. Such a good opportunity that one was, unlikely to be repeated.

2015-06-29 05:20:54,"&gt; *This is the relevant portion of the article, which was originally written by the user 'coc' in CBF: http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/fairfax-financial/what-percentage-of-your-portfolio-is-in-fairfax-financial/30/*

I’m surprised you all let this go. I’d like to comment on two things, both of which I consider nonsense.

1. It is “very easy” to find securities that will outperform the market.

2. Holding Fairfax is inferior to running around finding these “very easy” securities.

I think investors vastly underestimate how good Warren Buffett was at his job back in the 1950’s and 1960’s when he was buying these niche securities. He’s even better now, but obviously runs so much capital that his returns are lower. There seems to be this “Buffett envy” going on in value investing circles whereby investors feel the need to look for little cigar butts similar to what Warren used to – largely influenced by his talks to students and his biography.

And yet, I have seen precious few investors who have successfully done it. Beyond the platitude that smaller areas of the market are “inefficient,” there are considerable risks. You are usually investing in second rate businesses that destroy value, or at least are not really building any. Often these businesses are run by inexperienced managers and have little advantage over their competitors. Thus, the business risks you assume are big ones, although most investors think a cheap valuation makes up for it. Sometimes, but not always.

Take for an example Dempster Mill Mftg – a well known Buffett investment way back when. If you think through the situation, there was a good probability that the investment was not a wise one. It took heroic efforts by a new manager to keep Dempster from going under, and even then, it was not an absolute home run. Yet, most Buffetteers admire these types of investments Warren used to make.

But what was Warren’s largest partnership investment? American Express, a well known company then and now, not a micro-cap dishwasher manufacturer. He also had a successful investment in Disney, and one in GEICO, again two companies that were well known. What was probably his best stock investment at Berkshire? The Washington Post, not exactly “unknown.”

Yet we’re told that he made all of his great returns back then because he could look small. Well, as with everything in life, the answer is yes and no. I think there is a great myth that you need to look where no-one else is looking and be creative in the investment process. That you should get points for creativity or something. But the very same people propagating this myth are students of Charlie Munger, who once wrote to Wesco shareholders that “We try to profit more from always remembering the obvious then grasping the esoteric.”

Let’s talk about a few more of Warren’s home runs. Petrochina, one of the largest companies on the planet. Freddie Mac, one of the largest companies on the planet. Coca-Cola, the most well-known brand on the planet. BYD, one of China’s most well-known and well-respected companies. These are investments where, for the first 5-10 years, he made 25%+ compound annual returns. Who are these people not getting rich by consistently generating 25% compound returns? Where is this stock market where 25% annual returns don’t generate “alpha”? Why do small investors need to run around looking at micro-caps?

***

Let’s also look at some other legendary investors. What sort of returns did they achieve and what were they buying? Lou Simpson – 20%+ type returns buying very well known companies. Rick Guerin – 25% type returns investing in a pretty broad range of securities small and large. Ruane, Cunniff – 15% over 40 years investing in large stocks. Eddie Lampert at ESL – you would probably know of almost every company he ever invested in – 30% CAGR for a 15-20 year period. Glenn Greenberg at Chieftain – did 25% for about 20 years, again you’d probably recognize almost every stock he owned.

These guys are legends, they’re all rich, and they invested in a huge range of securities.

Who do we know of that was investing in small securities that no one has heard of? Here’s two: Schloss and Graham. Did either of them do 50% compounded? Hell no. They’re hall-of-famers with 15-20% returns. Do I need to bring up Charlie’s returns? What has he bought over time?

So I dispute this notion that investors are somehow doing themselves a disservice by sticking with companies they know well and that others know well. Well-known companies are often just as mispriced as small ones. “To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” says Munger. Yet the Buffetteers seem to only admire one tool for finding cheap stocks (size constraints), when myopia, ignorance, and a host of other biases are just as powerful in creating misvalued securities.

To wrap this up a little, I’m not saying there aren’t lots of small mispriced stocks. Buffett did very well with them, and there are probably others doing great, too. But recognize two things: 1. Huge CAGR’s are really, really hard. 2. You can do extremely well investing in larger companies, great companies, and well-known companies, without a lot of the risks of investing in broken-down nags. This is well proven.

So if you rationally evaluate Fairfax and come to the conclusion that you’re going to get 15-20%+ CAGR (eminently reasonable given the fact that they are a relatively small player in a gigantic global insurance market and are run by one of the smarter investment teams on the planet), don’t worry about how much “alpha” you’re not generating by looking elsewhere. Was it a mistake to invest in Berkshire when it had a billion dollar market cap and was well known? I repeat, there are no points for creativity. Don’t forget it takes a unique cast of mind to just sit on some great companies and compound at high rates with no taxes, professional investor or not.

I’m probably not going to convert anyone who believes strongly that they have to be looking in the dirty alleys for cheap stocks, but if you’re on the fence, hopefully this is food for thought."

2015-06-24 15:04:27,"While I agree with a lot of the advice given here (never stop learning, etc.), it's going to be incredibly hard to get to an advanced/expert/great investor level without real world experience.  The amount I learned in my first year out of business school exceeded what I learned in aggregate during college.

As a side note - most working investment professionals never achieve ""expert"" or ""great"" investor status. Very, very few individuals achieve excess returns over a long period of time (i.e. decades). "
2015-06-24 14:03:43,"&gt;  It is Livermore-like wisdom, seems simple, but true and will save you a lot of grief.

Literally, that's where the advice comes from.

I don't think people truly appreciate what he had to say.  His books are worth reading more than once.  Most people haven't read his real gem (""How to Trade Stocks"").  They love to quote his shit like people quote Warren Buffett but rarely, if ever, follow it.

I've learned to live by a ton of what he has said - his rules form a huge portion of the foundation of my understanding of the markets and how I operate.  I cannot stress the importance of what he's said enough to people.  "
2015-06-24 13:15:51,"&gt;My questions are:
&gt;How did you start learning about investments, and what advice would you have for a beginner?

Read investment books until you can write your own.

&gt;How do you come up with potential investment ideas? (What metrics do you use? Are they in line with Ben Graham's formula or not so much?)

I think it's best to weed out companies you don't understand. For me thats a pretty long list. Fashion, Beauty, Healthcare, Technology, Oil &amp; Gas, Real Estate, Chemicals, etc. Then there are ones that are just shitty businesses. Automobiles and Airlines come to mind.

Then kind of work from there.

&gt;How do you know if you're on the right track when trying to assess the value of a stock? How do you stop yourself from second-guessing your work?

You don't want to stop second-guessing yourself. No matter how intuitively I understand something, Im always willing to strip it down to it's core and reassess it. You actually make the biggest discoveries that way.

But when you do find a great stock, it should be obvious. The Pros should outweigh the Cons by a country mile. 

One thing I do though, as a safety measure, is I wade into stocks slowly. I don't pay commissions, so every week I buy shares. The nice thing about that, is it keeps me from making rash decisions. If I invest in a company, it'll take me me months before I have a significant % of my net worth invested in it. So Im actually second guessing myself that entire time, to make sure Im making the right long-term investment decision.

&gt;How do you personally go about analyzing stocks and industries? (Do you head straight for the 10k or prefer another method)

I always start with two simple questions that are designed to keep my out of trouble.

1) Do I understand the business?

2) Will the business be around in 10 years?

The answer should be an emphatic yes to both. In fact, the second one should make you chuckle. Now remember, I use the term ""understand"" loosely. No one is expecting you to be able to run the company, just own it. You should be able to talk intelligently about the company and in assessing the larger industry. You should be able to say ""Im buying this company because of X."" Most people can't.

As for the second question, this should make you laugh. *Of course* Microsoft will be around in 10 years. Now that question isn't so easy for a lot of companies. Will Netflix be around in 10 years? Will Facebook? Or Tesla? I really doubt people that think they can answer emphatically one way or another.

There's more too it than that, but Ill cut it short for now.

&gt;Are there any resources that will guide me through the process of researching a stock? Maybe a series of Youtube videos or a book. I just want some reference material to mentor me through the process.

Id recommend googling Pat Dorsey or Warren Buffett myself. They're the two whose investment philosophies I most identify with. "
2015-06-24 12:50:02,"There are two main ingredients to learning how to invest: philosophy and experience. 

PHILSOPHY:

 - Read the Berkshire Letters to Shareholders or buy ""The Essays of Warren Buffet,"" which is an edited compendium of the letters. 
 - ""Margin of Safety"" by Klarman. (if you don't have a copy, I can get you a pdf)
 - ""There's Always Something to Do"" by Christopher Risso-Gill. Book is about Peter Cundill.
 - There are plenty of good books out there, but that is a start
 - I’m going to paste a list of my favorite videos at the bottom of this post. The video of Michael Price is just superb, he just nails it over and over. Other standouts are Buffet at Univ of Florida, Mason Hawkins at Ivey (that web site has many good videos), and the Cooperman one at some college. I put best 4 at the top of the list and the rest are in no order. 

EXPERIENCE:

 - At some point you have to put the books down and gain experience. 
 - My experience has been that the more companies I look at, the better an investor I become. The more companies you look at, the better a sense you will get of how the market values them. Patterns start to emerge. Companies that are growing get a higher valuation, companies with wide moats get a higher valuation, companies with healthy margins and low capex requirements get a higher valuation, etc. As you get a sense of what attributes merit what level of valuation, you will eventually run across a company with a valuation that does not match its attributes.
 - As far as valuing companies goes: you can use multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E, Market Cap/FCF, Price/Book), a DCF, or something more balance sheet oriented like the Graham approach. I tend to look at most companies using an EV/EBITDA multiple as that is what makes sense to me. 
 - Jump in and start looking at a few companies. Public filings are here: http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html
 - They key is to not get too hung up and just jump in and start learning about companies. I'd try to look at 15 companies before you consider buying the stock of one. Start with a simple one in a sector you understand. Next, look at its closest competitor. Then, look at a few other stocks in that industry. Why does the market hang different valuations on them? Do those values make sense?
 - If you want a suggestion, I think CBPX is a touch cheap, although not as cheap as it was a while ago. It is a simple company. It makes wallboard and has three plants. Then look at USG. 
 - I like to build models for all of the companies I look at. That is hard to describe how to do.

2015-06-24 08:02:17,"*How did you start learning about investments, and what advice would you have for a beginner?*

Focus on the downside. Take care of the downside and the upside will take care of itself. Always have some idea how much you can lose in the 'worst' case scenario. Rule #1: Don't lose money. Rule #2: Always remember Rule #1.

What do you know that the market doesn't? What is the market getting wrong?

You should check out this post by Brattle Street Capital - rules of thumb for investing: http://brattlestreetcapital.blogspot.hk/2015/01/10-market-aphorisms-to-tape-to-your-desk.html


*How do you come up with potential investment ideas? (What metrics do you use? Are they in line with Ben Graham's formula or not so much?)*

No, Ben Graham is very outdated. You read Ben Graham to get the general gist of his philosophy, which is that stocks are more than just pieces of paper, they are real businesses that create actual value for real consumers, and that one should always buy a piece of the business at a price substantially lower than its theoretical value, which is the aggregate of future discounted cash flows. That is all. There are substantially fewer net-nets in the current market than in Graham's time. Markets have gotten a lot more efficient, so utilizing his mechanical methods will not work. 
How do I come up with investment ideas? Well I follow a list of high quality businesses which I understand reasonably well, and I know to have a deep moat. I have a rough idea what the intrinsic value is, so when the price drops substantially below that value, I will buy.

Follow WSJ, FT, NYT. I've gotten some decent investment ideas from just following mainstream media.

You'll not get the best ideas from the mainstream media however. The best ideas will be of companies noones ever heard of before. The small cap market is generally a lot more inefficient compared with any of the S&amp;P 500, so that is where retail investors like you or me can gain an edge. 

*What metrics do I use?* 

It really depends on the industry. I would caution you against focusing too much on the 'metrics', especially something like P/E. Some of the most expensive companies have the lowest P/Es, and some of the cheapest have the highest P/Es. Try to understand the qualitative aspects of a business, what gives them a competitive advantage, and whether or not this edge can be sustained. Does the management know what they are talking about? Can they be trusted?

*How do you know if you're on the right track when trying to assess the value of a stock? How do you stop yourself from second-guessing your work?*

Overthinking is useless. You will make mistakes. That is how you learn. Don't bet the farm on any one idea (but don't overdiversify either). Don't utilize leverage until you're sure you know what you are doing. As long as you remain humble, you'll be fine.

In the long run, price will always approach intrinsic value, so if there is something wrong with your thesis, the market will always give you feedback. The problem with value investing is that this may take a long time. A good way of getting a second opinion on your thesis is by showing it to a mentor/friend, or by posting it on Reddit or another forum. 

*Are there any resources that will guide me through the process of researching a stock? Maybe a series of Youtube videos or a book. I just want some reference material to mentor me through the process.*

Check out Bill Ackman's presentations. You can find them online. Just Google Bill Ackman Procter &amp; Gamble presentation or Bill Ackman JC Penney presentation.

"
2015-06-24 06:26:17,"1) My background is in international relations, so I like to first contemplate what macro themes translate to trade opportunities for different industries. For example, when oil prices dropped last November, I began to contemplate what companies used oil as an input + how the price of this lower input would ultimately affect other firms expense structure. At the time, many people thought low oil prices = low gas prices = higher consumer income = greater spending in consumer retail products. This thesis helped 1) consumer retail cos 2) luxury expenditures (cruise lines, recreational vehicles) 3) airlines (just to name a few) rally. At that point in time, you can start contemplating investment theses; for instance, what will happen if consumers don't actually spend more on their excess income? How will it affect the aforementioned 3 industries? So the idea is (and where I share my advice with you): take something you're interested in and try to understand how more or less of its presence can affect other industries. Try to think how A affects B and how B affects C and how C affects D. 

2) When coming up with investment ideas, I like understanding broad macro themes and then narrowing those macro themes to micro ideas. An example is how I developed a stock pitch for Harley Davidson. Harley, like many other ""leisure / luxury"" investments rallied alongside decreased oil prices. This enthusiasm did not sustain itself in Q1: investors realized that lower consumer expenditures on gas did not necessarily correlate with increased discretionary expenditures. That, alongside 1) an unfavorable currency environment 2) poor weather hurt Harley sales. As a result, they're trading near all time lows. To find Harley, I thought of the broader theme (consumer discretionary industries retreating from Q4 enthusiasm). Here, I ran a screen for stocks trading at &lt; 15x PE (which = 6.6% or more earnings yield if you want to think in fixed income terms). I accessed this info through finviz.com (a site i highly recommend for screening). Then i dig in to companies within the consumer discretionary space and try to understand what led to price depression. Then i quickly ask myself: what does the depression of stock price represent? Exaggerated market speculation, or is this a longer term risk? Can/will the company revert to the mean and gravitate towards its historical trading levels?  

3) I play close attention to a company's historical financials. I like understanding the key inputs and levers associated with top line growth and levers which affect variable cost structures. I will typically lay out a Company's historical 10 year financials and analyze what the min, max, 25th, 75th, 5 year average, 3 year average, and last year financial metrics and ratios look like. I'll start at the top line and move down, understanding what drove growth / what factors could affect future growth; what could possibly affect COGS, SGA (and where those can be improved), what their cash flows look like and what the necessarily levels of investment might be. If i have reason to believe that a company has too many hurdles to overcome to replicate its best years (or wont be able to sustain its competitive advantage) then i start pulling out (of digging deeper). After parsing out the historical vals, I use those as ""switches"" in my model that serve as a starting place for operational assumptions. (for instance, if I'm running a DCF analysis, I'll look at historical EBITDA margins. I'll look at where they were last year and what their best year was. Was their best year an anomaly? Or can they achieve the same results? Here' I might use the cos average three year historical EBITDA margin and use that for the assumption for the first projected year EBITDA. then over the course of the 5 year forecast i project, I will choose the max EBITDA margin as the final year margin and grow in to that from year 1 (3 year historical average margin) to year 5 (max / best year ebitda margin). 

4) I like reading the news and thinking about whats happening in key industries. Then i screen those industries to see how stocks in those industries are performing (using finviz). From here, I like digging in to the investor presentation. Then I like reading the earnings transcripts. I'll typically skip straight to the Q&amp;A in the transcripts, as mgt typically reiterates what is said in the presentation with their responses. Also, analysts are a key indicator of what metrics drive the stock. After that, I read the K. I have a few models that pull metrics from FactSet that run an (almost) automated DCF (discounted cash flow analysis), CFROIC (cash flow return on invested capital), relative valuation (comps), and an ""EPS"" frontier (which takes a companies growth and margins and extrapolates future share price based off historical PE trading vals). I like parsing out what drives growth and margin expansion / contraction every year, and what catalysts may provoke improvements / degradation of operational performance. 

5) I'd first and foremost recommend the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros. He does a great job of connecting the dots and painting the ""big picture."" Its effectively a diary of his trading from the 80s onward. I'd also recommend Deep Value by Thobias Carlisle which is an attempt to quantify Graham and Dodd's / Buffet's ""qualitative"" approach to value investing. He runs a bunch of backtests on the relevance of different valuation techniques (eg, using PE vs EV / EBITDA), examining which yield the greatest returns + lowest degrees of risk when employing a rule-based investment strategy. More Money than God is awesome too - its an account of the history of the hedge fund industry. Lastly, I'd recommend Keynes/Hayek. Itll help you develop an interesting perspective on what role government intervention plays in modern economics. 

Best of luck, and welcome to a wide, wonderful world of exploration and intellectual advancement! "

2. [How I come up with investment ideas (Also refer to the 'Investment Search section of #1)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1gag5l/value_screening_metrics/cakfqos)

3. See #1 and #2. You should always second guess your work. You can and will be wrong and you should change your mind when the facts change. Your convictions should be very strong but weakly held.

4. Start with 10Ks, quarterly transcripts, investor presentations, and other filings. Look at competitors as well to see what differs. Next go to interviews and articles on the company and leadership. Then build a financial model. Then talk to people smarter than you on the subject (Other analysts, people in industry, customers, etc.) to see how much you missed. Then potentially talk to management. At any point in time during this rough process, you may find out things are not as they seem and you'll have to start over with another company.

5. See #1, but that's just the beginning. The [Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/239qj8/updated_reading_list/) as well as the entire Sidebar is full of resources to help you figure things out."
2015-06-24 01:50:28,"1- Try to figure out the value of a business. Watch the cash register of a local McDonalds for a couple of minutes. Look at how many workers there are. Estimate their revenues. Estimate the expenses. Estimate their profit. Then extrapolate and estimate the value of that one location by discounting the cash flows. Make this thought process second nature to you every time you visit a business. With practice, you came eyeball a business and come up with a ballpark value within seconds. It's not a big deal if you're wrong by 50% when doing rough estimates. Investing at that errors might take 2-3 years to recover. Make sure you don't end up making 50000% errors. You can't recover that in a lifetime.

2- Ranking companies by PE will give you a good start.

3- Experience and repetition of successful analysis

4) Financial statements to make sure they actually make money. No need to go further if they don't. Then 10-K for their accounting policies. That'll let you know if you can actually trust the financial statements at face value.

5) CFA curriculum will teach you everything you could have ever wanted to know. There's a lot of material, so you can skip around. Learn all the different ways of valuing businesses."

2015-06-23 10:16:54,A lot of really good advice here and it sounds like you're ahead of the game. Take a look at The Art of Short Selling by Kathryn Staley and The Big Short by Michael Lewis. The best I nvestors know when to go long and when to go short.
2015-06-23 08:48:28,"When it's really time to short the market, you'll have plenty of time to get your ducks lined up.

That time is not some random correction that you predicted using the phases of the moon, the lines on some chart, or some other methodology based on alchemy.  *Recessions cause bear markets.*  

When the economy starts to turn to a recession, you'll see it coming.  It will unfold over *months.*  You can lay as many shorts on as you want, sit back, and clean up later.  It will save you the heartache and months of poor returns that are typically the result of this sort of ""short sniping"" in a bull market."
2015-06-23 08:44:35,"This really is just a poor analysis.  The quality of articles out of Bloomberg is random at best - I'd peg this one in the lower half.

*Who cares* if mutual funds have to sell bonds due to redemptions?  This article treats selling like it's the scourge of humanity, and not the natural progression of actions which almost always lead to equilibrium.  Your sale because you're terrified of a 0.25% increase in rates is my opportunity to buy a fixed income security that yields that much more.  You keep selling and the issues become even more attractive to me.  You sell enough and I'd be an idiot not to get in.  Your loss = my gain.

Bond prices and returns, unlike equity securities, are based almost entirely on math.  Estimations of ""richness"" or ""cheapness"" on the part of fixed income securities are as wide as a hair.  You'd never hear a fixed income analyst say something like ""Is it right to pay 1,000 times the projected cash flow of this bond right now?  I dunno but I just have to buy!!!""

The marked-to-market price of any bond changes daily, but the contractual obligations of the bonds don't.  A liquidity ""crisis"" (whatever that means) in the bond market does not affect the issuer's ability to service those bonds, and it does not change the position or rights of the bondholder in the capital structure of the issuer or in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding.

2015-08-13 13:33:49,"I think you might want to simply consider different terms. Free Cash Flow to the Firm vs. Free Cash Flow to Equity can help distinguish between the two.   
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF = NI + non cash charges + Interest (1-tax rate) - CapEx - change in Working Capital) is the amount of cash flow available to all investors after accounting for expenditures necessary for the firm to keep operating (capex &amp; working capital).   
Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE = OCF - CapEx + net borrowings) is the amount of cash flow available to stockholders (for distribution) after working capital and fixed capital needs have been accounted for. 

How you finance the company is a separate decision from operating the company. If you can't generate enough sales to pay your people, then it doesn't even matter. If I buy your company with cash, then I care about how the actual business is doing, not how your financing decisions have impacted it.

2015-08-13 11:58:48,"Good answer and approximately correct.  I'd add a little nuance and say that companies can do 5ish things with their owners earnings, but the intuition on why your #3 should be excluded is correct.  5ish things a company can do with their owners earnings (levered free cash flow):

1a) Let it pile up on the balance sheet

1b) Invest it in financial securities unrelated to the core business (kinda the same as 1a)

2) Invest it back into the business (put it into growth capex and/or M&amp;A)

3) Dividend it out to shareholders

4) Use it to buyback shares

5) Use it to buyback / paydown debt"
2015-08-13 11:38:13,"I think I see what you're saying. Let me rephrase in my own terms to see if I'm understanding: 

Companies can do three things with owner earnings (i.e., the ""true"" amount of cash from operations that the business is throwing off): 

1) Pay dividends to stockholders - Irrelevant: dividends go to stockholders so the amount of cash as calculated in the owner earnings formula wouldn't be reduced by this amount. Easy enough.

2) Hold onto the owner earnings and reinvest in the business - Also irrelevant: this investment will be used to generate future (hopefully greater) cash flows and the stockholders will own those cash flows. Got it. 

3) Pay down debt: Every dollar of principal paid will reduce the claim on the business' future operating cash flow to debtholders (aka, owner earnings) by $1 and increase the claim by equityholders on those earnings by $1. Thus, it is a wash and repayment of debt principal is appropriately excluded from the owner earnings calculation. Do I have that right? "
2015-08-13 11:28:35,"Yeah the lumpiness, plus it looks like your use forgets the fact that debt owners own investments in the business too"
2015-08-13 11:27:51,"When you cross a certain size, you talk about debt capacity instead of debt repayment. Which means assuming debt as a perpetual part of the capital structure, on the assumption that your cash flows are healthy enough to refinance indefinitely. So cash flows become a separate and crucial component to the analysis. One argument for this is that debt is positive for the capital structure and having some debt on the balance sheet at all times is good (e.g. cable companies). Obviously this is subjective but well isn't everything. Thus assuming your liquidity and profitability is strong and bankruptcy risk is managed, you could technically refinance into perpetuity and the only material consideration about debt is finance cost. 

"
2015-08-13 11:25:26,"Think about extreme cases to help yourself see what's happening.  Imagine repayment of debt principal is really big ... and negative.  In other words, imagine the company is issuing a bunch of new debt.  Should that positive cashflow be counted in owner earnings?  Of course not.  The owner is ""receiving"" cash but also ""giving up"" something of value (pieces of paper called debt) that will cost them later.  To a first order approximation, this transaction should be neutral on the value of equity; so you can exclude it from owners earnings.  It's the same thing when the debt repayment is positive, i.e. the company is paying down its debt.  Sure, the company has less cash after the repayment, but they've also ""gotten rid of"" an obligation."

Also, Solar assets do deplete. They have a 25 year life...so the Yield that you receive year on year out of a solar plant consists of both a return on capital and return of capital and that stream will stop 25 years from now.

The SUNE + Yieldco model is a flawed model that works till it works. With the recent sell-off, how are TERP and GLBL going to acquire from SUNE accretively? At Dividend Yields of 6% and 11%+, they cant...which means SUNE has to find another buyer and the entire thesis behind TERP and GLBL falls flat on its face.

2015-08-11 21:55:25,"*Rolls up sleeves*

If were focusing on commercial aerospace (which comprises 70% of PCP's revenue, and is thus the primary industry driver), lets first look at worldwide annual air traffic. Since the 1960s this has grown from 0.5RPK (in trillions) to just a hair under 6.0RPK...remember thats in trillions. This is despite multiple shocks to the industry that include two Oil Crises,  the Gulf War, Asian Crisis, 9/11, SARS, and two financial crises. Currently the worldwide aircraft fleet is at about 24k (in 000s) and this is looking to grow at a 4% CAGR (impressive)...8k will stay in service, 17k will be replaced, and 26k will be new aircraft orders (growth factor) for a total of 51k through 2035. 

Airplane delivery growth should remain fairly stable. From 1990-Current this has CAGRd at about a 5ish% rate, and looking through 2035 should CAGR at, lets say, 5.7%. Engines have become a greater portion of the total value of delivered aircraft as requirements for fuel efficiency have increased overall costs. Despite some modest fluctuations, the engine  OEM market is dominated by four companies, all of which are PCP customers. These include CFM, Rolls Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and GE. All of these customers are in the process of launching their new line of mainstream engines, and many of these are built exclusively for the next line of mainstream aircraft being manufactured and delivered by Boeing, Airbus, and Gulfstream to name a few. 

So if we're dealing with aircraft delivery as the main driver of this industry, lets examine some common risks and bear points: 

* Fall in oil prices lowers motivation to upgrade fleet in order to improve fuel economy.

**Rebuttal** - To cut back on new engine expansion, as a fleet planner you would have to be convinced that fuel will stay at current levels for 10 years or more because you are making a 10-20 year capital commitment when you place an order...this is why Boeing and Airbus are not concerned.

* Deliveries to airlines owned by sovereign oil-exporting states may be delayed due to budgetary pressures.

**Rebuttal** - Analysis of Airbus’ backlog exposure to airlines owned by oil exporting sovereigns indicates that orders and deliveries from those airlines account for just 5-6% of Airbus’ overall orders and deliveries.

* Backlogged orders placed by budget airlines in Asia may fail to come through given slowing economic growth in the region and financing risk.

**Rebuttal** - Revenue passenger kilometers historically have shown resiliency through economic downturns. Widespread concern in 2009 about the “Funding Gap” was a non-issue in retrospect due to the availability of multiple financing channels. “I would say that all of these markets are even bigger today. The commercial bank market includes ...new banks in Asia. The U.S. bond market is as deep as ever. The Export Guaranteed market may be the only one under pressure, as Congress is trying to kill the U.S. EXIM bank...but EXIM has big backers in industry and I doubt it will be killed off so easily.” – VP of Greater China at major leasing company

So on top of all of that I think it would be helpful to illustrate just how large the aircraft industry really is. I've seen a lot of people on this board, and /r/investing, saying that ""now is the time to get into the aircraft industry! buy AAL, UAL, [other major airline]!"" and I can't help but facepalm at that. If we start at the very top, you have the aircraft OEMs (BA, EADSY) operating a duopoly, and really even above that the engine manufacturers who are consolidated into three major players (GE, UTX, RR), and investment casting even above that which is also a duopoly (PCP, AA). Once you go below the plane manufacturers you can start to think about how the airplanes are bought and sold throughout all of the airlines. Do these go through wholesalers, brokers, ???. This is done by another business that actually doesn't get much attention - airplane leasing (AL, FLY, AER). Moving on from that you have a lot of ancillary businesses that no one knows about. Fueling (INT), infotainment (WIFI)...there are actually so many of these that I don't really wanna take the time to type them out. But if you wanted to move to the next step down the ladder you'd have the distribution networks which customers plan and purchase their routes/trips through (EXPE, OWW), and the intermediaries between the TAs and airlines (AMADY, Travelport). There are also a lot of ancillary businesses around the travel agency level as well - hotel accommodation vendors (PCLN), review sites (TRIP), and not to mention the rental car agencies (HTZ, CAR) and the actual hotels themselves (HOT, MAR). All of these businesses earn retarded returns on capital, and there was a time you could buy them all at mid-teen FCF yields. You might note that I never mentioned the actual airlines - its because they are bad and you should not ever buy them. 

I hope all of this answers the questions - Buffett is buying into a fantastic industry in possibly the safest way possible. Should have bought PCP, but oh well."
2015-08-11 18:26:26,"Montier is one of my favorites, always look forward to his pieces. I know he's pretty Neo-Keynesian, but 

&gt; The failure to distinguish between different monetary regimes is a common failure amongst economists. For instance,
Wray and Nersisyan (2010) point out that all of the defaults that Rogoff and Reinhart document occurred under systems of
fixed exchange rates. Yet their results are often generalized (very inappropriately) to all monetary regimes.

Quoting some MMTers?? He must REALLY not care about redemptions (for the record, I'm a MMTer as well).

&gt; Haven’t I just admitted that real cash rates matter for equity valuation? Yes, **in extremis**, but in neither of the two cases above do I really believe that the real cash rate would be sustainable at such levels in perpetuity; **the real cash rate is probably bounded and can’t just wander off all over the place, barring events like hyperinflations.** In effect, I’m arguing that given the range of probable outcomes, the epistemological limits are binding. That is to say that **we can’t really tell what the real rate will be in a range that matters for our investments.**

Agree 100% with this. And seeing as how Buffett has gone on record saying he uses the same discount rate for every business (he stresses valuation comes from the numerator, the cash flows), it seems that this view has other adherents. 

Great piece. The Kaldor-Pasinetti reference was giving me Piketty flashbacks."

&gt;First, I didn't see anything in your analysis that actually explained why the price of salmon will go up, and that's a a key point you should clearly go over.

 It's in the last part of the industry overview. Supply is expected to slow down dramatically while a balanced market needs a supply growth of around 9% to be in balance (according to the industry reports/market outlooks I've read. Not based on primary research).

&gt;An overview of the supply/demand cycle of salmon as well as where we are in it (peak or trough) would be great.

 Got it. My macro knowledge is very limited at this point and when I looked at salmon prices I didn't make the direct connection to the potential substitutues and their effect on the price of salmon. I'll keep that in mind next time I look at a food company :)

&gt;Another point is that I didn't really see a thesis anywhere. You have your main bullet points, but those don't really make a thesis.

 The thesis I tried to make is: ""Slowing supply growth is expected to cause an increase in prices. Here is the company most fit to take advantage of it"". I don't really know if that counts as a thesis but that was the main idea behind my analysis.

&gt;You said management is strong, but what have they done with the cash besides issue a dividend? Is cash being invested? If so, what's the return on capital? Are shares being repurchased? Is equity being issued? What are management's incentives for compensation and what performance metrics are they tied to?

 Well, except for the last question everything is in there. The five year investment plan and the issue of share repurchase/issuing is being mentioned several times. As you said yourself, this shows that I need to condense my analysis and bring out the key points. 

&gt;Did you undertake any primary research throughout all of this? Understanding why the price of salmon will rise isn't something you'll learn by reading financial statements or an annual report, you'll need to call up and talk to the suppliers, buyers, and others in the industry who can give you a first hand opinion.

 I have a Faroe relative so I did some light ""scuttlebutting"" regarding the quality of Bakkafrost fish and their reputation. I didn't talk with insiders, suppliers, retailers etc. At this point I'm not comfortable cold calling people and asking them questions about their industry. I know it's something that has to be done at some point but at this point I don't want to risk calling an industry insider and sound like an absolute newbie.

&gt;I don't mean to tear it apart, it could be an interesting idea if you're right, but there are just some loose ends I noticed.

 Don't sweat it! This is exactly the kind of reply I was looking for. Thanks again! :)

*It is for this reason that I have argued that the test of a valuation is not in the inputs or in the modeling, but in the story underlying the numbers and how well that story holds up to scrutiny.*"
2015-08-10 10:26:57,"Okay, so basically the idea here is that you think the price of salmon will increase while consensus thinks it will stay flat/decrease. I don't know anything about the salmon industry, but I can give you some comments. 

First, I didn't see anything in your analysis that actually explained why the price of salmon will go up, and that's a a key point you should clearly go over. If you did, and I missed it, then it's another reason why you should focus on condensing your write ups like we mentioned, so things like that don't get lost in a lot of text. 

An overview of the supply/demand cycle of salmon as well as where we are in it (peak or trough) would be great. 

Did you look at substitutes for salmon? For example, poultry and beef are substitutes. When the price of beef increases, consumption of poultry increases and vise versa. Whats the primary substitute for salmon? If the price is currently depressed, there is probably a good macro reason. I'm not really a fan of tackling macro just because it's not an area of competency for me. 

Another point is that I didn't really see a thesis anywhere. You have your main bullet points, but those don't really make a thesis. 

You said management is strong, but what have they done with the cash besides issue a dividend? Is cash being invested? If so, what's the return on capital? Are shares being repurchased? Is equity being issued? What are management's incentives for compensation and what performance metrics are they tied to? 

Did you undertake any primary research throughout all of this? Understanding why the price of salmon will rise isn't something you'll learn by reading financial statements or an annual report, you'll need to call up and talk to the suppliers, buyers, and others in the industry who can give you a first hand opinion. 

I don't mean to tear it apart, it could be an interesting idea if you're right, but there are just some loose ends I noticed. "
2015-08-10 09:51:05,There was an article posted about this guy once in this sub.  The article was very unfavorable.  It made him seem like he couldn't deliver on any of his promises and he enriched himself while only providing mediocre returns to his investors.
2015-08-10 08:34:06,"Great question! Thanks :)

 The analyst consensus is somewhere around ~3,5% CAGR revenue growth in the next three years. This is equal to no salmon price increase, no harvest volume increase and lower-than-guided results from the investment plan (or another mix between the three revenue drivers). 

 Based on my analysis I think the analyst consensus is too bearish. I see growing harvest volume (not huge growth but some) and realization of the guided 4% revenue CAGR as a result of the investment plan. On top of this, I expect rising salmon prices in the next years as written in my industry analysis. 

 Could I have missed something important that makes the analysts more bearish than me? Of course! I'm still learning and I would be surprised if I hadn't missed something. "

2015-08-10 08:24:48,Thanks! In the future I'll try to produce a one-page summary to accompany my full analysis. 
2015-08-10 08:00:08,"Really great analysis, great detail with good writing!

Several questions: how do they perform in peak trough situations, ie 2008/2009. Salmon to me is slightly above average price protein and how does this impact the cyclicality of the business. You addressed they are over earning, so we know they might be at some kind of cyclical peak but... 

How does supply expansion/price action usually happen in this industry as well. Maybe a past look at a cycle.

Overall: what a good analysis and it was a really fun read first thing in the morning. "
2015-08-10 07:49:51,"To add to this: I think you gain another level of mastery from shortening all the extensive analysis you have into a single page. The ability of being able to boil down to 70% of the story in 10% of the space is so useful for pitches as well as understanding what is extremely core to the story and what is details that don't add to it.

2015-08-10 00:28:57,[deleted]
2015-08-10 00:26:34,"A good practice which was done to me was to produce a one page analysis. 

Its not saying that this complete analysis isnt great, because it is pretty good imo, but when you are in a meeting they sometimes dont have the time to read or listen to your pitch. Humans have very short attention spans and count on you i.e. the analyst to answer their questions on the spot, having the complete report as a reference guide that they can look at for their own curiosity.

So you give them a one page summary and if they get interested they can read the long report or you can point back to the complete report. 

Other than that, this is pretty much what i do too structural wise so if anyone thinks this analysis is garbage i would like to hear why too. "
2015-08-09 22:56:28,"I would just go through cases on the VIC one by one:
http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/

Its a perfect way to learn because each case spells out for you exactly how a thesis is developed. Plus there are some brilliant posters on there like Charlie479 and a large number of historical posts that you can analyze. You can learn a tremendous amount through historical cases because you will know the outcome!! You can sort by highest rated long thesis. According to the following paper these ideas average over 20% a year for the first 3 years and so even if you invest in a selection of these ideas you should do well. 
http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/HedgeFund.pdf

Finally I would start even before reading the VIC by going through Joel Greenblatt's lectures (pdfs&amp;videos) that can be found at csinvesting (use google to find). These provide an excellent series of lectures on value investing that should give you the basics to understand the VIC."

2015-08-09 11:18:10,"Cool, thanks for the reply.

Q1: How has value investing as a hobby worked out for you? Do you find that you can still find good opportunities? Do you have any formal training in finance?

Q2: It sounds like at this point, we can still only use computers as a ""screening mechanism,"" at which point human due diligence is necessary. Is this accurate, and do you expect this trend to continue?"
2015-08-09 10:31:09,"I have academic background in AI and Big Data and I am an hobby value investor. I tried to marry AI and VI. Here are my findings:

Just throwing in data and hoping that the AI finds something meaningful is not useful. As mentioned before, too many variables. The more variables, the exponentially more data you need to train the model. Gerd Gigerenzer did some research on Mean-Variance-Model. As I remember, for 10 stocks a MVM needs 10 years of market prices to work; for 50 stocks MVM needs 500 years of data. A typical company does not exists that long. MVM is an unbiased model. As there is not enough data for an unbiased MVM, Gigerenzer proposes biased methods, like heuristics. This thought is reflected by EV/EBITDA metric from ""Quantitative Value"" book. EV/EBITDA works in many cases but not always (for example inflated earnings). 

Currently I search for domain specific AIs and heuristics which support my investment process at screening level. One of the topics is ""circle of competence"" as a number, so that I can screen out companies which are not near my circle of competence as well as having a number which approx. the confidence I should have about my analysis (therefore eliminating over-confidence bias)."
2015-08-09 09:50:34,"**Closing statement**

 This is my third (the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2jvr2y/lets_take_a_look_at_prosafe_my_first_analysis/) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2w2upj/lets_take_a_look_at_yara_international_my_second/)) and final analysis before starting on a bachelor degree in economics. In my opinion, I have made massive progress since my first analysis posted here ~9 months ago. Back then I had no clue about what I was doing. I’m still far from my goal but I feel like I have some kind of understanding about the process of proper security analysis now. I want to thank this great subreddit and the community for allowing me to post my research and for providing constructive feedback. It has helped me A LOT!

 I started this analysis when Bakkafrost shares were being traded at 180 NOK and it looked like an absolute steal with limited downside. During the work of this analysis, Bakkafrost has appreciated ~40% closing most of the price/value-gap I saw initially. I still consider Bakkafrost a great buy (especially for guys looking for exposure to the (sea)food-industry) but I would prefer if you would focus your comments on my thought process, research quality etc. instead of the quality of this particular investment case. What is lacking in my analysis? Is the industry analysis too soft? Is my interpretation of the financial statements wrong? Is it too much to look at each item in the financial statements? Should it be more like: “I think the balance sheet is solid, here’s why BAM BAM BAM DONE”, or is it okay to do a full breakdown? What about the graph quality? etc. Anything that can help me get closer to my dream of becoming a professional security analyst would be great. 

 About the valuation section: I started to run out of space (40.000 character limit) and had to condense my assumptions about each case into a few lines rather than typing out every specific assumption and my reasoning behind it. I hope that the few lines about my assumptions together with the proforma statements were enough for you to follow my thought process. 

 I welcome any and all comments whether it is praise, criticism (I prefer the constructive kind though) or a question.

2014-01-03 11:59:35,"If EBITDA just turned positive the negative cash flow and earnings are likely due to the top half of the income statement (poor gross or operating margins) not DD&amp;A, Capex or interest. 

I do not invest in companies that have always had negative earnings or have negative normalized operating income, nor would I. 

1. Normalize Earnings: Replace the current earnings (that are negative) with a *normalized earnings* (that is positive). This approach assumes the negative earnings are a one off and will return to normalized (positive) level in the future. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
2. Estimate Revenues and Margins: Based on revenue projections over time and estimate operating or net margins. The margins should increase from the current levels (which are negative I assume) to a positive margin or the company is not very successful. The revenues and margins, can be used to estimate earnings. Once earnings turn positive and margins stabilize, valuation becomes more routine.

 An alternative and related approach is to estimate capital invested for future years and returns on capital over time, to arrive at estimates of earnings in future periods. Pretty much guess work and dart throwing when near-term cash-flows are that volatile and you capitalize them 10 years. 

3. Reduce Leverage: When a firm reports negative equity earnings because it has too much debt, (not because it has operating problems) the simplest way to adjust earnings is to reduce the leverage of the firm. This is because (hypothetically) as the firm operations grow over time, and financing charges are lowered (as leverage is reduced), the equity earnings will become positive. (Essentially eliminating interest charges.)

You have to buildup to revenue from unit economics in order to handle situations like this. You should find information on the price and quantity of each of the tests MYGN provides. You should also find information on what portion of the payors for each test are Medicare. The calculation for revenue would be # of tests by payor X price of test for payor. After unit economics are incorporated into your financial model, you changes in assumptions about unit economics effect the value of the company. This is much more elegant that projecting revenue growth rates.

You can also go in the other direction. After you incorporate unit economics of the business into your financial model, modify the assumptions until you hone in on the current stock price. This frames your argument as to whether the market is pricing in plausible scenarios. This technique is talked about extensively in [Expectations Investing by Mauboussin &amp; Rappaport](http://www.amazon.com/Expectations-Investing-Reading-Prices-Returns/dp/159139127X).

Lastly, there was a great writeup of MYGN posted on Value Investor's Club in October. You should check that out.

2014-01-01 15:18:02,"I'll be honest and I don't mean any insult but if you say you've been reading things for hours, scanning possibilities and even taken classes then you should be able to know something as basic as ""The correlation between stocks prices and bond yields"".  You may be spending hours as you say learning and reading but perhaps the process you're currently using is the problem and that translates into results that aren't as good or not understanding things as well as you should.I second what currygoat has said, good blogs are very very few and quite minimal and if your investment knowledge isn't good enough to tell the difference between a good investment and a bad one then even following blogs won't be as helpful because the one time some blog writer messes up his due diligence you won't be able to tell the difference because you think they are doing good work.I would recommend first honing your own personal investment skills and then look more into blogs because you will then be better at sorting out what is good from the fluff."

2013-09-27 11:51:32,"It really depends what kind of value investing you're doing. If you're a Buffetteer, then you want to do a lot of thorough qualitative research. If you're investing as a low p/e investor and your portfolio is highly concentrated then you want to do a fairly thorough analysis to make sure that the earnings are going to stay solid. 

I do a quasi mechanical investment strategy. I select stocks that are statistically undervalued based on their price to net current asset value and then look for other positive metrics while avoiding stocks that have worrying metrics like a high debt load or high management salaries to earnings. Mechanical investing is great because you can take advantage of the population returns of stocks that fit a certain metric. For net net stocks it's anywhere from 20-35% on average per year.

This will give you a better idea of what I'm talking about as far as depth of research:

http://www.netnethunter.com/the-bucket-approach-to-net-net-stock-investing/

I would stay away from DCF since, while it is the best valuation method in theory, in practice it is very very problematic. The math makes sense but your valuation is only as good as the assumptions you make and I don't know anybody who can predict earnings 10 years into the future with any accuracy or consistency. Your best to base your analysis on something that has a more solid footing... like asset value or average earnings. Remember, when Buffett was making his highest returns he wasn't investing like he is now... and he also recommended small investors stick to Graham-styled investing."
2013-09-26 20:29:27,"i agree, and i want to add a related point.  there are people who make money exclusively off of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this law.  over the years, they will flesh out all the nuances and issues with obamacare, and those who are most adept at parsing it will prosper."
2013-09-26 18:42:36,"I doubt that any intelligent investor (i.e. those that read this sub) would take action merely based upon this article.  However, having said that, this law is very big and very young.  It WILL be heavily litigated and, as a result, courts will likely change important pieces of the ACA.

Just as Ben Graham cautioned us to stay away from new issues, it may be best to stay away from securities that greatly depend on certain portions of the ACA remaining law for their future success."
2013-09-26 17:47:20,Please do it. I'd love to see what we come up with.
2013-09-26 17:00:21,"In the overall picture, I think this company just got old and has not innovated or, generously saying, made a half-hearted stab at it. It sounds like their ""new"" direction is just giving up retail, which I don't think is bullish at all.

If I had the company, I'd stop trying to sell with such width and focus."
2013-09-26 16:53:02,"Interesting about the car service locations. Sears definitely occupies lots of ""the other mall"" locations. Much of the bull case rests on finding something to do with the ""anchor pad"" at the better locations, see the rendering of a new Burlington Mall Sears in Boston. Maybe Sears could turn the second floor into retail shops, and have Diehard/Kenmore on the lower floor. Basically shut down the softer side of Sears. We'll see. It's definitely been a cult stock for a long time. "
2013-09-26 16:37:12,That's something I didn't know. Might make it work after all. Stay tuned...
2013-09-26 16:19:21,"lands end would do ok. I didn't realize they were sears, which is probably a good thing. 

Their service centers are actually doing rather well. I was in the automotive business on the parts side. A couple of years ago when they were closing stores and I asked the manager about the closing stores and its impact on him. He replied rather logically. In sprawling cities a suburb that was prosperous in the 80s, where there would be an old mall, that now is defunct or unpopular. Generally you have folks that are lower/middle class and older folks that stayed in that area. Both hold on to their cars longer and thus need repairs, where there is still a sears service center. Also, small towns that have one do ok as well.

Their other brands like craftsman and diehard are under a lot of pressure. there are three companies that make batteries nowadays; there's no quality to speak of; at least to a well informed consumers. In addition, all of them are losing their warranty agreements, that was the major selling point to a diehard.

You've got the internet selling tools, as well as the big box home improvement stores and harbor freight, i'm sure, is gaining significant market share. They are usually in the same neighborhoods as the Sears. 

EDIT: terrible punctuation and spelling. sorry. "
2013-09-26 16:06:22,"Peridot is right, counting the real estate plus the operating business is double counting. If you sell all the prime Sears car service locations, then what is that worth? Although I do think Lands End would do fine without Sears, probably even do better. "
2013-09-26 15:01:06,"All risks worth thinking about but the overall value greatly outweighs the risk. Also, the great thing about google docs is that it retains a revision history."
2013-09-26 14:53:20,"That's a great idea. I may start one up and post it to the sub. Maybe it'll end up being something that we can have put in the sidebar, as long as it is good and of value. Some problems I have with the public ""hive mind"" approach: 1) It would be easy to ""sabotage."" Not that anyone would do it, but someone could put meaningless items on or just go in and delete the whole thing. 2) Along the same lines, it could easily get out of hand and we'd end up with an insane number of items."
2013-09-26 14:45:13,"Good reads on both of them.

The above article does a good show explaining that while yes their real estate is valuable; the other side of the business the more obvious one is their retail. Their retail is a sinking ship. Malls in general are not a bet I would take. Look at JC Penney. The cater to the masses department stores seem to have lose an incredible amount of business to the internet, wal-marts and targets.

So that being said, if Sears has all this real estate that will be profitable; I'd be sure to take a real hard look at it. The value would have to be completely tearing down old and outdated malls and starting fresh without a sears retail store.

I wouldn't touch this one for awhile."

13-D's are usually from investors that have greater than 5% of the company. They may or may not be management. I mentioned 13D's as you'd want to know if there were other entities trying to influence management. If you want a fuller picture of who owns the company, you'd have to look at 13F's and 13G's as well.

I think you're missing the point though. You want to know if management's interests are aligned with you as a shareholder. A comparison of the size of their holdings to their salary, whether compensation is in option or shares, and whether management is buying or selling their holdings should suffice. There is no need to build a script to know exactly how many shares each manager or director holds at any given time."

However, you can still do a good job on your own. The last piece you're missing are proxies. One thing they do is show management compensation and ownership of stock.

2013-09-25 05:33:18,"Thanks Owylde and curryGoat. A few more queries. It seems that 13d is only for new +5% holders and form4 are for those who sell some of their holdings. 
But maybe I am missing something but there isn't a page that shows a current aggregate? 
Also Proxies are new to me. Looks like I will need todo some reading on that. 
The bloomberg data must be available for subscribers right?"

2013-09-24 23:52:11,"Bloomberg most likely. 
Also ownership above 5% is reported in preliminary and/or definitive proxies. Going through these proxies is especially important when a company has multiple class of shares each with different voting rights and in situations when the original owners have options to buy the stocks, since sometimes the shares available for purchase are erroneously treated as shares owned by Bloomberg and/or other data aggregating firms.

2013-09-24 13:40:04,"i mean i can't write the script for you, cause i dont have enough time.

but here's the gist. you can use a script to pastevalue the 52 week low for the stock every day. ( =googlefinance(""ticker"",""low52"") ) - this needs to be pastevalued incrementally, you can't have it in real time, or else it will just reset if the price ever goes below it, and you wont have a viable trigger.

then in another cell, you can have =googlefinance(""ticker"",""low"").  This will continually update the low price of the day in real time.  Then you have a separate cell with an if statement that is conditional upon the ""low"" being lower than the ""low52"" value.  Then you write another script to email you if the trigger cell is ever tripped.

i mean its just common sense really...just google around for google apps script for emailing and you'll be able to figure it out im sure."

2015-10-06 16:00:42,"&gt; A significant share of my clothing is from Uniqlo. It's held up absurdly well, better than equivalent $100+ items. When compared to my American Apparel clothing, the difference is noticeable.

I've had different experiences from both Uniqlo and American Apparel. At the end of the day this is just anecdotal evidence. If you look at their filings, you can see that sales have held up despite the turmoil happening within the company. I'd say that's a good sign that consumers haven't abandoned the company.

&gt; Finally, turnarounds in Retail are extremely difficult, especially for one that has to go through Chapter 11. Can't think of a single post-Chapter 11 example to refute that.

Sure. But most retailers start to fail because their brand value has been damaged, And its insanely hard to change brand image. I don't think this is the case here."
2015-10-06 15:54:56,"A significant share of my clothing is from Uniqlo. It's held up absurdly well, better than equivalent $100+ items. When compared to my American Apparel clothing, the difference is noticeable. 

American Apparel's are sparsely attended in NYC. I'd consider a brand's perception in NYC reflective of its perception across the country. NYC is the fashion capital of America. 

There's only so many people at American Apparel corporate, along with in-store sellers, that you can fire. The savings here would be savings, albeit surely a factor less than those found from international relocation.

Finally, turnarounds in Retail are extremely difficult, especially for one that has to go through Chapter 11. Can't think of a single post-Chapter 11 example to refute that. 

American Apparel's best bet is to be acquired post-reorg by a retailer with a somewhat similar brand aesthetic, who sees value in both the real estate (AA stores have a nice setup, I'll give them that) and its brand value. The presence of Standard General in this reorg process is somewhat comforting, and the best thing going for AA at the moment. "
2015-10-06 15:46:42,"""Uniqlo is better quality than American Apparel. ""

??

Have you shopped at Uniqlo before?

""American Apparel's are ghost-towns.""

Not where I live, and definitely not reflected in their financials.

Anyways I said that there were comparable number of shoppers at AA and places like J Crew, Gap etc.. not Uniqlo. Obviously there will be more people shopping at Uniqlo given that they are targeting and pricing for the mass market. 

""The biggest cost savings opportunity for American Apparel is to relocate manufacturing abroad.""

I'm talking about SGA, not COGS. But sure there is an opportunity to improve gross margins by relocating manufacturing abroad too."
2015-10-06 15:19:14,"American Apparel is not significantly higher quality to Uniqlo. Uniqlo is better quality than American Apparel.  Here in NYC, Uniqlo's are always bustling while American Apparel's are ghost-towns. 

The biggest cost savings opportunity for American Apparel is to relocate manufacturing abroad. "
2015-10-06 15:15:12,"Sure but I think American Apparel is significantly higher quality compared to Uniqlo. I live on the East Coast, and where I am, their stores are not exactly bustling with people, but it's not empty either, the number of people I see shopping there is quite comparable with J Crew, Gap, Zara etc. If you look at their financial statements it's not like sales is cratering, but they are just suffering from the cost structure. If management has the will, there are many ways to cut operating expenses... just look at 3G. "
2015-10-06 15:02:29,"Still don't see the bull case.

Assuming there is no fraud, it's still a heavily leveraged company with 10 bn (out of 25 bn) in good will that depends on acquisitions for growth. They claim to be more efficient with capital allocation, but they've spent more than 40 bn on acquisitions compared with just ~10 bn for R&amp;D at a company like Biogen yet they are still not GAAP profitable despite 'cutting the fat' and having a supposedly top operator-owner in Mike Pearson! How can anyone think this is a good business? "
2015-10-06 14:05:30,"1. The monthly activity isn't much.  If you have an account of the size required to meet their minimums, you'll probably save more than the fee by lowering your trading costs 
2. Other brokers usually have annual fees which amount to more than the annualized IB fee.
3.  The IB monthly fee is waived if you trade a certain amount (check their website for details)

As to why they're the best - lowest trading costs, wide product availability for equities, low margin costs, interface is great once you learn how to use it, very customisable reports etc.

People complain about their customer service but this complaint isn't valid in my experience.  They have an online ticket reporting system where very quick responses are given.  They also listen carefully to customer suggestions and frequently incorporate them into their trading platform."
2015-10-06 11:55:51,"I just don't see how they get a turn-around though. In terms of brand aesthetic, Uniqlo pretty much dominates that niche. 

Their Halloween costumes always seem to do well though. "

2015-10-06 03:59:34,Yeah just doing it for the name really isn't worth it at this point. We are okay with growing slow even if people can't find us as easily due to the name. I think I even asked the original mod of /r/valueinvesting about doing it a few years back right at the start but they weren't interested and now it's just not feasible or worth it to do. It also seems you wanted to build /r/valueinvesting into a sub that's different from /r/securityanalysis. Either way thanks for asking but it's really not something we are looking to do any time soon.
2015-10-06 03:50:41,"Ok, I just thought you might have wanted the name ""value investing"" for the sub. Like valueinvesting.com vs securityanalysis.com. Anyway it's alright, cheers. "
2015-10-06 03:46:30,"Yes but I don't think currygoat or I are going to move regardless of whether one commenter want or ten do. If the two subs were similar in size it would make sense but why move 11000 plus subs and information to one that has less than 500. I'm simply trying to understand the point of the merger. What would make more sense is to pose this question to your subs at /r/valueinvesting.

We might have considered this scenario way back at the start but there is such a discrepancy between the two right now that it doesn't make sense to do unless /r/valueinvesting grows over time that we have two big groups that should be together."
2015-10-06 03:37:43,"Ok, I just thought you guys might want to. Cheers. Though you might want to leave it up, as there's at least one commentor who mentioned they wanted it. Maybe others might feel the same way."
2015-10-06 03:36:14,"Hey, I removed this as I don't really see the point of it, it's not as if the two subs are competing for readers and we really aren't going to go through the hassle of moving all the information and users on here over there.

But with portfolio companies that have routinely underperformed for years like CNA, BWP and DO, the stock price of L has retreated in recent years since his article.  In another piece, the BI waxed enthusiastic about Bill Stiritz, the CEO of Post Foods, and about Post.  The BI especially liked the fact that Stiritz bought tens of millions of dollars of Herbalife at a time when that company and Bill Ackman were at war.  I have long thought Herbalife to be a pyramid scheme and an undesirable investment so the investment by Stiritz did not persuade me to buy Post.

The other interesting aspect on this kind of research is that the market goes through periods when stock price are utterly insensitive to such reports and other times (like presently) when any report moves the price of the stock especially if it is negative."

2015-10-03 18:14:58,"So you like the product mix?

How about the integrity of management? No red flags there? Have you read AZValue's blog posts on VRX? 

Possible legal/political risk? Have you considered the implications of leverage on valuation? They are heavily leveraged (15bn long term debt vs 4bn current assets as of FY 2014) which makes them inherently riskier... especially once interest rates start going up. 10bn of the 26 bn in assets is comprised of goodwill. 

The article you posted is true, but its also missing the point. The point is that the majority of R&amp;D is expensed in the income statement, yet most pharma/(the big) biotech companies still manage to turn a GAAP profit. VRX is spending a lot on acquisitions, essentially what they are doing is capitalizing R&amp;D, so that you don't see the expense on the income statement, yet they still fail to turn a GAAP profit. They are supposedly managed by the best-in-class operator in Mike Pearson, having cut a lot of fat (and much of the muscle) yet they are still losing money every year! 

Also they're growth depends on making acquisitions, which isn't sustainably.. the larger they get, the harder it will be to move the needle. And they aren't even comparable to Berkshire since they will only acquire companies in the pharma/biotech/healthcare products universe. 

I laugh when Pearson talks about cash earnings/Adjusted EBITDA. 

""It amazes me how widespread the use of EBITDA has become. People try to dress up financial statements with it.

We won't buy into companies where someone's talking about EBITDA. If you look at all companies, and split them into companies that use EBITDA as a metric and those that don't, I suspect you'll find a lot more fraud in the former group. Look at companies like Wal-Mart, GE and Microsoft -- they'll never use EBITDA in their annual report.

People who use EBITDA are either trying to con you or they're conning themselves. Telecoms, for example, spend every dime that's coming in. Interest and taxes are real costs.""

Just my opinion though. Haven't done a deep dive into the company (haven't got the time), so I could be wrong but there seem to be too many red flags for me to bother when there are so many other opportunities out there. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on VRX though."

That being said, I would like it if Valeant came out with a press release on re-pricing important products for customers who can't afford it. I have personally used Penlac before. Without my insurance, I would have been out of 200$. Very steep when you consider the size of dosage.

2015-10-03 02:54:10,"Yes of course - what I should have typed to be more precise was 'add panels new to the existing solar farm with capacity equal to 15% of the original output'.  That way you have all the old panels operating at 85% efficiency plus the new panels which bring you up to the same capacity as the original farm.  You're only incurring capex for a number of panels equal to 15% of the original amount installed which was the thrust of my argument.  

What would you assume for efficiency loss after 30 years?  I've heard from a couple of sources that 0.5% loss per year is reasonable as there are no moving parts.

Also, you didn't address the other option which I outlined, which was just to leave the existing panels in place and instead of signing a new PPA for the same power output as the original contract, just sign a new one for 85% of the output (or less depending on your assumption on efficiency at that time).  That way you have no capex at the end of the PPA, right?"

2015-10-02 15:29:19,"One thing to note that is kind of my pet peeve. This is a pitch that is a bit optimistic. It always is optimistic but let's pull it apart really quickly.

1) 8% margin gap doesn't get closed overnight. O'reilly has a really solid supply chain with what seems to be the industry leading system with hub and spoke

2) ORLY has grown the fastest out of the big 3, and is a really great company in the scheme of things, it seems really bullish to be like oh yeah we think it could be this price once we sell it at ORLY's EV/EBITDA multiple that most likely won't be justified for another 5-10 years of intense catchup. 

So that brings me to this point: I think activist on AAP is amazing, like its about time. The only company run worse is PEP, and I think it could totally be a true value creator over time. But it seems extremely naive that it could catch up to ORLY's/AZO achievements that have been made over a very very long time. Pitches are always WAYYY over optimistic, so keep that in mind. "

I had seen documents (e.g. Mercatus report) implying that unlevered IRRs for solar projects had dropped 1 to 1.5%, but hadn't seen a drop of that magnitude.

With regard to the margins, let's say that efficiency drops 0.5% per year, so after 30 years efficiency is at 85%.  They can either sign a new PPA that provides 85% of the power that was previously provided, or replace about 15% of their panels (at vastly lower prices due to the learning curve) to maintain the same output.  Yes there are a few other parts that wear out but these are not expensive to replace.  Even at lower PPAs, that sounds like margins will be pretty good at that stage.  With 85% of the asset fully depreciated and depreciation being the main expense, there would be a lot of revenue coming in relative to cost, no?"

2015-10-02 09:19:03,"I'm being a bit hyperbolic.

The panels aren't worthless as in they're non-functional.  Here's what I meant.

The reduction in efficiency requires a certain amount of $$'s to be put into either repairing, replacing, or retrofitting the old panels.  Along with that, the PPA is going to be renewed at a lower price per kwh, simply due to the trend of solar.  Look at any of the new large scale PPA's being signed....I've seen them come in anywhere from 30 to 80% lower than PPA's even a year ago.  So you have money you have to put into the panel, and then you sign a new PPA that generates a fraction of the cash flow you were earning on your old contract.  What this means, basically, is that margins get absolutely SMASHED when PPA's roll over.

Just do the math.  The economics of these things are terrible.  And this is all based on large scale commercial set ups.  If you look at residential the picture is SO much worse.  Which is why the Vivint acquisition was so universally despised by the market."

People in the industry I've spoken with say that the cells lose about 0.5 percent of efficiency a year, implying that at the end of 30 years they still have considerable electricity generation potential despite being fully depreciated from an accounting standpoint. Can you point to evidence to the contrary? "
2015-10-01 17:08:38,"This article is dumb.  Take it from someone who has spent weeks attempting to put together a reliable valuation of the company - there is simply not enough information disclosed by SUNE to put together any sort of judgement.  I've gone through every filing the company has on Edgar and the disclosure is just horrible.

Bronte also misses some key points - no talk about the decline in PPA pricing, no mention of the fact that solar panels are virtually worthless at the end of their contracts and the amount of CapEx that would have to be expended to either retrofit or replace them, etc etc etc.

I'm not saying it's a bad investment. I'm saying that there's no WAY that ANYONE who's not an insider at the company can reliably determine that.

*Side note:* If you do believe in the company, the entire investment is predicated on the assumption that the yieldco's will be able to jack their stock price up enough to reduce their cost of equity to a point where the economics make sense.  Because as it is right now, the cost of equity is solid double digits and it basically destroys the entire story of how the company works."

2015-10-01 09:58:16,"Ok, well, I am thinking I was *incorrectly* treating ""shareholder equity"" as ""market cap"", or that I was including market cap in the balance sheet... 

Therefore I was claiming the market decline had rocked the company's balance sheet, not the other way around.

I had *forgotten* that the issued share capital on the balance sheet is listed at par/stated value. i.e. they received that money from the initial placing and offering etc, with possibly paid in capital in excess of par value. That entry on the balance sheet would not increase or decrease with market movements, it remains at par/stated value (i.e 5c ordinary shares)

To answer your BP correlation, peak in 2010 was $62 and they lost 50% to $29 per share, when looking at the net equity for dec 31 2009 this was 181bn and dec 31 2010 was 101bn. the shares have never peaked above $62 since but have floated around 20-50% higher than the $29 low (which may indicate this is a time to buy VW)

2015-09-30 20:26:40,"These are two different, but related things. LIBOR is the calculated rate (by ICE these days, I believe) that banks can borrow from other banks, for various lengths of time. For the USD, the 3M LIBOR is generally the most commonly used for benchmarking.

A swap is a derivatives contract where the two parties agree to exchange payments at regular intervals. The 10Y USD swap rate (like the one you have in this graph) is the quote for fixed-float swap, where one party would pay fixed (in this case, the swap rate x days accrued x 1/360), and the other party would pay floating (LIBOR x days accrued x 1/360). The floating leg on these 10Y USD swaps is set every 3 months and pays as often, the fixed leg pays every 6 months.

As you can see from the above, the two are definitely related. The swap rate payments on the floating leg are determined by LIBOR. However, the difference here is that LIBOR is set every day. The market expects that over the next 10 years, LIBOR will increase. Given that, the swap rate is increasing, reflecting how the market expects LIBOR to increase over the next 10 years.

Another important thing to note is that this swap rate is called a par swap rate -- which means that both the parties entering into this contract did so on the expectation that the total value of each leg was equal. While the fixed rate is definitely above LIBOR right now, the market expects that LIBOR will eventually be above the fixed rate, so that the parties will, on a (discounted) net basis, receive the same amount of money from each other.

As to correlations, they probably should be, but it won't be 100%. The current period is interesting because the Fed is expected to increase the fed funds rate, which will cause LIBOR to increase, so swap rates are increasing. But LIBOR won't increase very much until that fed funds rate increase happens.

LIBOR is historically low right now, [as shown here](http://www.macrotrends.net/1433/historical-libor-rates-chart)."
2015-09-30 18:14:14,"In the interest rate derivatives market one might swap a variable interest obligation (floating) for a fixed rate interest obligation. Typically, markets use 3 month LIBOR as the variable rate. So, if one had a 10 year floating rate deal at L+500 they would swap to a 10 yr fixed deal at the Spot swap + 500. The swap rate is calculated by bootstrapping out implied forward 3 month LIBOR rates at any given time to generate a fixed rate. In normal markets, forward rates will be higher than the actual future spot, so the swap rate tends to systematically over estimate. 


I worked on an interest rate derivatives desk for a summer 2 years ago, memory might be shakey but I'm fairly sure that's all correct. "

2015-09-30 13:41:59,"No I actually don't think all rollups are bad. Let's say 99% of companies that are intentionally defrauding investors would be bad investments...I would say maybe 80% of rollups are bad investments. Rolling up companies is a viable strategy for some industries (most famously with cable), and there are operators who are able to execute this strategy remarkably well, but these are the exceptions, not the rule. 

In general i would say it a bad strategy, and they make for even worse investments because investors seem to have fallen in love with them again after the release of the Outsiders book, thus the prices of most roll ups have been bid up. "
2015-09-30 13:27:04,"Why are you comparing them? 

I ask because it would seem like they are affected by different inputs. Nominal 10-yr fixed is more impacted by moves on the long end of the curve, which is in turn driven by long-term interest rate and inflation expectations. When banking conditions are normal, 3-month LIBOR is really driven by the Fed Funds and short end of the rates curve.

Over long periods of time, I guess they'd be positively correlated. But over shorter periods, the curve can steepen and flatten, right?"

2013-11-24 15:09:04,"I like the idea.  The basic idea of the article is:  LL has significantly higher margins than the hardwood floor market as a whole.  They recently got pinched by the feds for selling wood that may have not been harvested within  regulations.  They probably won't get a significant fine, but their margin will probably be affected because they won't be able to retain their advandage of high profit margins because the scrutiny will cause them to monitor their sources much more carefully, and buy only regulation compliant wood.

Another point of the article was that all of the online reviews of the company were fairly dismal, except for one source which looked like it was heavily manipulated.

One caution theory I had based on the conjectures of the 2 arguments is that LL caters more to commercial installers than places like Lowes or Home Depot.  Part or their margin may have to do with the fact that they are selling a lower quality stock (which probably has a higher margin).  Professional installers are probably more skilled at working around imperfect stock.  

While I don't think all of their market advantages are due to using illegal sources, I think it will be significant, and I think this stock has a good chance at getting a major haircut.  They're forcasted to have earnings of about 3.40 next year, that looks like a 30 PE.  (Whoa! hadn't looked at this chart in a week or so, looks like this report may have already affected the price. Down 13 on Friday.)  But a 30 PE for a commodity supplier seems pretty tough to maintain,  it seems like the industry should carry closer to a low teens PE.

I think a lot of people are looking at LL to benefit from a home construction boom, which I think that there is a possibility of occuring.  But, they may be so large now, that it may harm their margins more than others.  They were able to grow very fast because they were do get wood cheap when the market is down where suppliers were in bad position due to low demand.  If home building spikes, no mills are going to be selling their stock at low profit margins just to remain open."
2013-11-24 15:03:09,"Hi,

I'm the author of the post, let me try to answer your question.  First off I found long ago that most readers aren't looking for exhaustive investment briefs, they're looking for an entertaining post that might or might not be the starting point for a great investment idea.  Some posts are just thought material, others are suggestions for further research, the current post is a suggestion for further research.

On that note..

You're right that deposits have declined since 2011, but if you investigate 2011 you'll see that they were flooded with a rash of hot money.  Hot money isn't good for a bank, they aren't sustainable deposits.  The sustainable deposit base has remained fairly fixed for the past decade.

In terms of the branch network it's obviously something I'm more familiar with due to my familiarity with the area.  They have branches in Bellevue, Franklin Park, McCandless, two in Cranberry and one in West View.

The Bellevue branch is in an older neighborhood with a lot of seniors, the type of people who are great depositors.

Cranberry, McCandless, and Franklin Park are all very nice suburbs with far above average incomes.  Cranberry especially has been experiencing a lot of residential growth over the past decade.

No bank really wants to be pushing 30yr loans, they are typically the worst type of loans.  At a 100bps increase in rates WVS would be keeping the 15yr loans on their books, and at 200bps increase would keep 30 year loans, but 30 year loans are not ideal.  What the bank needs to investigate is niche lending, commercial lending to landlords, or small business lending.  These types of lending can be done with the relationships they have in the community and at a higher rate, and a shorter duration.  This is the value of community banking, they are not exploiting their advantage here.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with bank investing, but an activist does one thing, they either clean up operations by firing management, or they work to sell the bank.  

Hope this helps."

2013-11-24 02:46:45,"&gt;If I could summarize my post to this point it would be: West View Savings is a very conservative bank with a poor lending program, solid deposits, and a great branch network selling at a cheap price.

I know you're supposed to do your own research, but I'm going to comment only on what was written in the article.  From the above quote there are five assertions, only two of which were proven by the article - the bank is conservative and has a poor lending program.  Deposits have fluctuated since 3Q2011 but have ultimately declined from 2Q2011 - 2Q2013.  Is this solid in absolute and/or compared to other local/regional banks?  Do they really have a ""great"" branch network?  What does that even mean?  Is 72% of book value a cheap price?  Compared to what?  Is aggressively pushing 30yr mortgages right now at 4-6% a pop in the best long-term interest of shareholders?  If an activist got seats on the board, what would they do to boost value?

I don't mean to attack the author, rather start a dialogue with the community here."

The only thing that really matters is free cash flow, when you buy a business you're buying the present value of its stream of future cash flows.

Your analysis of a business should center around this. Just think intelligently about the business and you're likely to figure out what the important drivers are.

Sometimes cookie cutter industry metrics are actually things that will lead you astray. Take SSS. It might be misleading, what if SSS is going up but actual cash flow generation is 0 or negative because heavy competition is leading to major discounting? Store count is another one. What if store count is going up dramatically, because of overexpansion? Capex will be going up a lot, so FCF generation will be minimal and then the overexpansion and fixed costs of the increased store count will crush profits.

You should start with a focus on free cash flow and then think about how the business is going to generate more and more free cash flow. From there it should become obvious what types of metrics to look out for. "

FOX Business Network (FBN) Senior Correspondent Charlie Gasparino reports that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman withheld “new information” on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) at the Robin Hood Investors Conference today. Gasparino goes on to say that Ackman is “likely to make the new information public on Monday.”

“Bill Ackman was supposed to come out with ‘new information’ on Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) to support his thesis on the stock.  FOX Business Network has been told that the new information – he withheld it at the [Robin Hood Investors] conference…he’s likely to make the new information public on Monday. Amid all this stupidity, I mean he’s been building this up for weeks now, shares of Herbalife were up 6%.”"
2013-11-23 16:27:18,"Very interesting. I did not even think these guys would be public. I have heard of them before. Definitely have a good position. 

One concern which I will look into more, is their volumes of work. I have read that coin and stamp collecting is decreasing. So I would be very interested to see how popularity of these and other collectibles are doing and are projected to do. I think looking at trade show attendance will be a half decent external indicator.

2013-11-23 14:32:45,I finished that book several month ago. It's a good drama/documentary in my opinion. It's shocking how corrupt government and businesses can be. I was following HLF when Icahn and Ackman were having their duel over whether the company was a fraud or not. I chose to stay out while a friend of mine decided to buy when it was at a low at 25 dollars. His conviction is that Herbal life is world wide with people we know who sell the stuff for a living. As for me i know a guy who's actually living a nice life over in Cali selling this stuff but I didn't want to get trampled on when giants clashed in battle.

Portfolio construction and position sizing also comes much more naturally to public market investors in a proactive setting, whereas in a private, control investment setting investments tend to be more reactive, with sizing more naturally dependent on target EV instead of an assessment of relative confidence."

2013-11-22 10:19:15,"there's no standard way for this though. For example, hedge funds were huge on Sears not because of its store count or sales per square foot, but because it was an anchor store in a ton of big mall. They were essentially investing in a real estate company saying that it's got so much downside protection from its cheap leases and property values at historical cost that it doesn't matter what happens to the stores.

Same thing with Lowe's back in 2010. It owned the majority of its stores and everything was historical value. Lowe's stock dropped to a point where some investors were saying that its property was worth more than its market cap (obviously there's still debt to factor in etc, but you get the gist). 

You can say that these company's are valued incorrectly then, wrong industry etc. Problem is, the market by not be as rational as you are and then you got to wait. Want to value Apple with luxury brand metrics? Or News Corp (NWS) as an entertainment company (half its EBITDA does not come from printing/publishing)? Either one would have helped you in the long run (one to bail on, the other to buy after spinoff).

However I first used a 3D system for rapid prototyping in 2004.  While the valuation may be crazy on the stock, It seems perfectly reasonable to me for a large industrial machine company to be custom building these machines and making sales via loans and lease agreements that include service. 

Look at something like ISRG it had a very similar business model when starting out.  Sell a couple very expensive robots per quarter.  This lead to crazy volatility around earnings.

2013-11-21 13:46:40,"So far I still think this is a good idea.

I've read through the most recent 10Q and the two most recent 10-K's. I also listened to the earnings call from the most recent quarter.

I need to look into and model the unit economics of Piceance Energy and Texadian Energy. The oil refining part isn't that complex. I'll need to get some information from a Bloomberg terminal.

Things are still very early and I don't expect earnings to start showing in the financial statements til mid 2014. PARR just closed the purchase of the Tesoro Hawaii Refinery and Texardian Energy is ramping up one of its major terminals.

The cost advantaged crude thesis has credibility. Phillips 66 (PSX) is currently executing the same strategy. They have already purchased 2000 tank cars and are shipping cost advantaged crude from the Bakken to its refineries. I still have to understand and model what the unit economics of this decision is and that will be an upside case.

http://www.phillips66.com/EN/newsroom/feature-stories/Pages/AdvantagedCrude.aspx

In the downside case, I'll have to focus on the asset value of each segment. I'll can just use the price they paid for Tesoro Hawaii since it is very recent. I'll spend the most time on Piceance Energy. I think there was a good primer I posted a couple months back about valuing shale oil and gas plays. I'll probably use that.

I've got other companies to finish looking at but this is definitely on my watch list now.

As measured based on the index constituents today (no adjustment for survivorship bias), the median shares outstanding, index to 100%, from 2003 to present is 99.7% (i.e. shares o/s are essentially constant).

The mean of 123% is positively skewed due to the presence of financials that were diluted massively in the GFC. If adjusted for survivorship I'd think both median and mean should go up.

AIG is the biggest diluter at 1129% (i.e. 11.3x).

XOM is at 67%. IBM 64%. For the other BRK major holdings: WFC 155%, KO 90%, AXP 84%, PG 107%, WMT 76%.

2013-11-20 10:42:28,"Always an interesting read. A couple thoughts: on Inker's graph of the Return on Sales of the S&amp;P 500 since '69 - wouldn't the shift in the US economy from products towards services result in a higher return on sales as well?

So Grantham and Inker are notorious for their belief that prices/returns/etc revert to the mean. ROEs should decline from here because they are above historical average. Return on sales should decline from here because they are above historical average (after accounting for factors like his Intel example). But, in the chart showing US Net Investment since '52, they make no similar claim of mean-reversion. If reversion to the mean is such a powerful concept why wouldn't they assume that US Net Investment would also revert to the mean? 

In Grantham's first chart with GDP &amp; S&amp;P prices, he basically says stocks are overvalued because prices are above trend relative to the value of GDP. But with the surge in globalization, and the ability for US companies to compete in international markets, is GDP really the best yardstick against which S&amp;P returns should be measured? Why not international GDP?

2013-11-19 21:57:10,"I think ROIC as measured for the XOM upstream assets isn't a fair comparison to other businesses.

Because oil and gas properties are continuously depleting, and depletion is based on historical costs (not replacement / all-in F&amp;D costs, let alone costs of corporate acquisitions), ROIC doesn't really reflect the IRR of the business projected at a steady state if all-in F&amp;D costs have substantially increased (with the rise in oil prices).

Thinking about recent capital allocation: looking at their acquisition history they paid 12x trailing EBIT (i.e. 8% pretax EBIT yield) for XTO in 2009, when gas prices were WAY higher than they are today. I'm not familiar with the specific economics or development stage of the XTO assets, but I can't imagine they are earning a reasonable IRR in the present state of the North American natural gas market.

Curious what others think on this."
2013-11-19 21:56:43,"&gt; The ability to expense everything rather than capitalize it? Huge economies of scale?

&gt; Have you ever tried to build out data centers? 

Neither of those address the switching costs for *Dropbox users* to other services (vs. prospective users).

&gt; I'm not sure where you make that leap, but ads just don't play into this business model. Dropbox has been disciplined in creating its cloud environment, right down to the open source API. I think it's ludicrous that you even brought up ads. 

I'm asking about where the revenue comes from.

&gt; Is Dropbox losing money? (Honest question)

I don't know, but I strongly suspect they are. Sadly, my fund didn't get the CIM for this one... possibly because I, like my colleagues, are disgusted by the general euphoria and lack of appropriate skepticism in the internet sector today."

2013-11-19 21:37:40,"&gt; Do you know what Dropbox's revenue mix looks like? Enterprise vs. c

Does it matter? What's the switching costs of a harmonized cloud environment that Dropbox offers vs. in-house data center and backup tapes? They are building their own grave with low switching costs.

&gt; And you're delusional if you think Dropbox would touch ads with a 20 foot pole

The next sentence is where you go down the dangerous path of ""traditional valuation methods don't apply to this business"". Long-run, how is Dropbox going to generate revenue AND make a profit margin on that to compensate them for their investments in storage infrastructure?"

2013-11-19 21:19:58,"Q: If you wanted to create a file syncing and personal cloud storage service, how would you go about it?

A: I do not think barriers to entry need only apply to whether a greenfield business could enter the segment. Existing companies could also move into the space, as Google Drive has done.

I reference the following lists of competing services, which, like Dropbox, I suspect all of which are cash-flow and earnings negative.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_backup_services

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_hosting_services

Q: How long do you think it would take you to reach 1mm users?, How long would it take you to get to 100k paying users?, How much money would you need just to get to this point? 

A: How much money did it take for Toyota and Honda to bring GM and Chrysler to their knees? Capital will flow to where returns can be found (or thought to be found...). There is no shortage of capital for pre-revenue tech startups these days. Will that last forever? Probably not. As I said above, there are many tech companies who have i) hundreds of millions of existing users, who each have better B2E (see Google, Facebook, Apple) and ii) massive net cash balances with big time R&amp;D budgets. Dropbox versus Apple -- I wouldn't take Dropbox's side in that fight.

At the end of the day it's an incredibly fast-growing segment that has encouraged a lot of new entrants to fight for a slice of the user pie. It's unclear to me whether as the business matures a pure-play cloud storage company can generate attractive returns on capital (capital here being a big-time limiter of earnings growth: this is not a tech company with light or scalable capital requirements!).

Question for you: what does Dropbox possess that can prevent user erosion if they immediately converted to a 100% premium model?

My view: it is unclear to me how substantial the network effects are between their users. I used to share investment writeups with friends using a shared Dropbox folder but lately I prefer using Google Drive. As I posted above:

&gt; The ""laziness"" moat could erode quickly if people expect an unpaid, ad-free experience and lose that. I think it would take me 30-45 minutes to install a competing service on my six devices that have Dropbox installed today. Sync time based on internet speed. Not worth everyone's time but a big chunk of users would certainly consider it before punching in their credit card for a paid subscription."

2013-11-19 20:11:18,"The ""laziness"" moat could erode quickly if people expect an unpaid, ad-free experience and lose that. I think it would take me 30-45 minutes to install a competing service on my six devices that have Dropbox installed today. Sync time based on internet speed.

Not worth everyone's time but a big chunk of users would certainly consider it before punching in their credit card for a paid subscription."
2013-11-19 17:32:49,"BTW, I'm getting 15GB free with Google Drive.  Skydrive is 7gb. What's Dropbox?"
2013-11-19 17:26:26,"Well, I used Dropbox for awhile thought it was a cool idea syncing files to a server. Then I heard about Skydrive and google drive. There is no moat when I can drag and drop all my files from Dropbox into google drive or Skydrive in a matter of seconds and closing my dropbox account. So where is this ""tremendous"" barrier of entry?"
2013-11-19 14:44:59,Thanks for this. Awesome insight.

2013-11-19 09:51:33,"Both him and Howard Marks prefer market performance, or even underperformance on the way up and consistent outperformance on the way down, i.e. superior performance through the cycle."
2015-11-19 23:54:15,"My view is that ""reporting ex FX growth"" is a cop-out in cases where the currencies have significant interest rate differentials (mostly emerging market currencies). Over time you expect currencies which have high interest rates to depreciate, and you have to live with the current purchasing power anyway. This is mostly observed in CPG companies who have large EM business (e.g. Mondelez). USD earnings is what we want and by removing this depreciation you give credit for local inflation/FX depreciation in growth.

For companies who sell in EUR, not a big deal."
2015-11-19 23:34:55,"A topic I can really sympathize with as I've been looking at a lot of companies w/ this problem. For like metrics, you can try to find organic/underlying/ex-FX growth numbers they have, as well as take out FX effects from EBIT mentioned elsewhere in this thread.

At one point in time, i completely agreed with you, and just focused on the underlying. They should be temporary effects, and should go away eventually in the longer term. There is a good reason to believe that since the rest of the world is growing faster than us (just structural factors such as population, increasing productivity, longer lifespan), that the dollar should deprecate in the extremely long term relative to them and actually be a tailwind overtime...

However you should be note that even though it doesn't impact the core business, there is extremely crazy impacts and just ignoring the FX impacts all together is insane. Look @ the BRL/USD. It depreciated like ~70% against the dollar, and large portions of the extremely important Brazilian ag market paired with ag cycle has crushed a lot of agriculture atm. Another thing that is important to note is that even though it won't impact core, currency movements can happen for very long periods of time and effectively make foreign subsidiaries big zeros (Think Venezuela, argentina, other hyper inflation). We can't control this as investors, but it is still our job to assess/navigate the risk involved.

And regarding management excuses, they will do anything in their power to convince you that the underlying business is a-okay. Whether its weather (for 2 years now lol), FX, inventory destocking, temporary working capital, an ""Investment cycle"" (god i love this one, if you have to reinvest into the business, it may normalize out but I mean its not like the new underlying base is maint. capex...) And so on and so forth. So yeah, take it with a grain of salt but its pretty logical and semi-obvious when they are reaching for excuses and when they are not. FX should actually match the decline in currency, and having multiple convenient excuses at any given point in time is something that is to note as well. "
2015-11-19 22:38:32,"So interesting and intense.  You can see this as a great example of the delicate and tension-filled balancing act that a company's management has to walk to keep both customers and investor/owners happy.  And then there's government regulations and taxes to deal with.  Company management is responsible to customers, employees, shareholders, and governments.  Anyone else?  Oh yeah, their own best interests.  Wow, seems really challenging.  I wish I knew where I fit in... : ( haha shit.  "

2015-11-19 21:04:41,"I wouldn't suggest selling fundamentally sound companies over the sort term simply because of FX conditions. Better of speculating on currencies :D .

But I think its an important issue to ask management whether they hedge currency exposures. This would help gauge management prudence. Also, I feel that it is best if companies issue debt denominated in FX where their income is derived which would provide natural hedge."

2015-11-19 20:49:45,"&gt; The way I go around this is to eliminate the FX effects from operating income, this should clear your views from management mambo jambo.

See, this is what I do and it makes everything so much better. 

It honestly seems like a non-issue to me, just the normal ebbs and flows of the market, but some people over react very strongly to it. 

My frustration about it comes from the fact that I'm the PM of my University's student fund that manages $1-3mm, and over the past semester a lot of our student analysts have covered companies that were negatively impacted by FX and interpret it as the sky is falling without any additional support by actual company operations. Its an easy route to go since its kinda an obvious issue you can extrapolate, but I agree with what you said above in that its a very short-term way of thinking and more of a trading mentality. I guess its just annoying for me to deal with on a semi-constant basis since we own a lot of blue-chips with low cost basis and we get sell recommendations just because of FX. 

Glad I'm not the only one who tries to see through the volatility. "
2015-11-19 20:35:29,"This is actually a question that really bugged me a lot too. To me, the markets have 2 types of 'investors', short-term traders and long-term investors. Traders do not mind taking a short term view and bet that favourable FX conditions would proceed to cause short term earnings to go higher and hence buy into those stocks simple because bottom lines are growing (I believe a majority of sell-side analysts work like this).

Investors who take a long term view I feel should not be too worried about short term FX effects and instead focus on the underlying fundamentals of the company i.e. the demand for their products like what you have mentioned unless the FX effect is more likely to be a permanent stay due to structural changes in macro conditions (e.g. Swiss francs unpegging).

The way I go around this is to eliminate the FX effects from operating income, this should clear your views from management mambo jambo.  "

Lastly, ""John Beals"" claims that Quest Ventures tried to contact Slyce numerous times, but Slyce failed to reply to them each time. This does not correspond with Slyce's version of the facts.

2015-11-19 14:11:07,"Thanks for sharing. To clear any confusion for other readers, an unsolicited bid occurs when the target company receives an offer of acquisition at a time that it does not seek to be bought out. In my opinion, the company most likely hasn't sought to be bought out as it has focused on a rapid growth strategy and recognizes the opportunity in the market they hope to capture. 

Furthermore, in the link I provided, it states that Quest Ventures currently own less than 15% of the common stock. This is quite a large percentage of the outstanding float provided it is just under 15%. 

Also, in the silicon investor link you provided, he states that he can't find a website for Quest Ventures... I was on the website last night and it actually popped up on the front page. You may view the website here... http://www.questvp.com/ I'd question his knowledge and credibility. It's good that you're questioning things nonetheless.

The split is really what the press release said; ConAgra is going to focus on their consumer packaged goods (CPG) business, and Lamb Weston will be free to pursue their commercial foodservice growth.  The relationship was (and still is) good between the companies, but it is easy to see that neither company serves well as a jack of all trade, and would grow stronger and faster by focusing on what they do best individually."

You know I posted the buffet video the other day and my take away from that was he threw in the caveat that ""which we may have seen the last of and which we may not have seen the last of."" High valuations may continue to rise or high valuations may not rise. 

Shorting just seems a lot harder in a world that is biqst towards riseing multiples. Where as if there's a company that's a lower cost producer trading at a lower multiple then someone is going to say look at them we should buy them out. Lot easier convince people the lcp at a lower multiple route than multiples are too high we should short.

Shorting on ""deeply immoral” (shenanigans like mentioned above) grounds would be better. Going after bad behavior is very easy in theory(HLF?)....then again I'm in F&amp;F so one could argue on immoral grounds against shareholders shareholders despite its the shareholders that argue against the govt based on reniging on its deal with shareholders."

For examle, Pioneer can drill wells in the Midland Basin that are economic at $40 oil. Consol's best acreage needs $3 natg to work. Most their acreage needs 4+ natg to work. His comparison of the btus per well is just silly. Per btu, oil will always trade at a premium because its better for transportation as it is more compact.

The best shorts are always the ones where you can uncover some sort of illegality taking place, aggressive account shenanigans, or going around regulatory requirements.

2015-11-18 15:55:47,"first, very jealous that you work within a HF, just received news from one (less than $150m AUM), that despite an awesome interview, they won't be hiring a new analyst until they complete raising on new fund. 

Second, yes I believe I was quick-to-judge on the style of the presentation at first, which led me to bias the substance.  

Third, yes, Einhorn has his own way of doing things, usually reading in his boring, nerdy voice from a paper with humor thrown in.  

So, touche, I may have been premature to call his research unsophisticated. I probably attributed too much weight to his YTD performance and style of presentation, rather than content and utilization of those metrics."
2015-11-18 15:43:53,"Of course. But a lot of people in the industry whom I've met are very ""savant"" smart - smart in one particular niche and not in others. Not to mention the egos there."
2015-11-18 15:39:21,"MANU is one of the few stocks where the price doesn't react immediately to very obvious events.  Two years ago when it was obvious that they wouldn't even make the champions league, the stock price didn't move until the company announced the loss of revenue resulting from the miss.  And this year, the opposite happened and still the stock price only reacted after the fact.  Strange.

Arsenal is a much better franchise from a financial perspective.  They make great money on transfers and done a great job with their international expansion"
2015-11-18 15:33:18,"Just running out right now but a few quick notes. Stadium comparables are going to be hard to do due to location; Arsenal has a smaller stadium in terms of capacity (60k) and I think their stadium cost less than the Cowboy stadium but its value is going to be higher due to being in central London. 

Similarly Old Trafford's capacity is a good 15k larger than The Emirates stadium but Arsenal brings in the same amount of revenue from ticketing. In light of this I also wouldn't expect a 25% increase in capacity to lead to a 25% increase in gate receipts due to the diminishing returns on the increase in seating capacity.

And I don't know if you do but take a look at a blog called The Swiss Ramble, he does of a lot of writing on the financial side of football."
2015-11-18 15:29:06,"As someone who works in a HF, i know what it's like and you're right it's insane. Even slightest whiff of anything related to research its marketing.

I think you may be assuming some of his intent, and it's hard to know what Einhorn wants to do. If you look at some of his past slides it's pretty consistent with his personality/presentation style. He's going to present how he wants, and this is pretty consistent with his personality (to my knowing). Additionally it isn't rare for Einhorn to present, he gets invited to tens of conferences and he has the opportunity to present research at his time/place. 

I mean he has something to prove with his investors, but that is mostly done through 1 on 1 meetings/phone calls, and every question he answered in the slide deck has already been discussed in more detail on a personal basis most likely. Also I think the mindset might be different as well, keep in mind he is worth ~2 billion and his fund is around 12 (most likely less now). He could close the door tomorrow and most likely be able to still run to some extent at scale with employees.

Also I don't think the pitch is as bad as you make it out to be, I've read a lot of pitches and Einhorn is usually a bit higher quality in assumptions/logic than most, and just because he doesn't use sophisticated metrics doesn't mean it's bad. I think you're mistaking style for substance. "
2015-11-18 15:14:44,You would be a fool to believe it doesn't harm their prospects. 
2015-11-18 15:10:34,"Hedge Funds are under strict non-marketing guidelines, they can barely issue PPMs to their current investors, let alone regurgitate return metrics to the public.  

I was stating that it is rare that a Hedge Fund has an opportunity to present research that is not construed as Marketing the fund.  You would think with his horrific performance (estimate) YTD he would lay off on the humor and focus more on richer content with better, more sophisticated metrics."
2015-11-18 14:54:15,Staley doesn't actually say that Active Management Wins in the Long Term at any point in the interview.  He would never make a statement like that about the active management industry as a whole.  That terrible title was written by Robert Huesbscher (the interviewer) and is based on his misinterpretation of what Cates said to him. 
2015-11-18 14:16:28,I forgot to mention the fees wasted on bankers.
2015-11-18 14:06:48,AirJordan would be a much more appropriate acquisition

2015-11-18 12:48:46,Does Greenlight have sector analysts? Unsure how they operate. I know Baupost doesn't.
2015-11-18 12:34:20,Protip: It would not be a waste of anyone's time to track down and read every single BlackHat post on WSO.

2015-11-18 11:12:17,He's been very off recently - I think he's lost his touch
2015-11-18 11:11:47,Maybe they should acquire AirSolid too!
2015-11-18 11:07:43,"There is a town hall meeting today, so after that I can probably answer these questions better.  Until I know the new leadership structure, I'm not sure how things are going to change internally.  As for costs, Lamb Weston pays for their own infrastructure, sales, distribution deals, transportation and logistics, IT resources (billed internally by ConAgra IT), and marketing.  I don't think it will be a huge impact on this side of the fence, and with the added agility, it should improve value to shareholders.

Edit: Just got back.  Not a ton said that wasn't in the press release, definitely no details."
2015-11-18 10:45:50,"So when they first bought Lamb Weston, what happened to all those ""synergies""?  They no longer exist today?  I'd rather have one board of directors than 2, one CEO than 2, etc etc.  It's not like the valuation multiple on the 2 businesses varies widely.  They will trade at the same multiple but now there will be some cost additions because of extra overhead and public company costs and so on.  So net net it's value destroying to shareholders.  "
2015-11-18 10:43:58,"Einhorn will never need to market for the rest of his life?

He's David einhorn lol. People know who he is and what he does, I don't think the marketing perspective is important.

I think the fact that CNX has been abysmal is pretty important, and this doesn't really remedy this. "
2015-11-18 10:42:02,"It's not quite that simple.  Lamb Weston has pretty much done their own thing anyways since they were acquired by ConAgra.  They have their own systems, manufacturing, and distribution.  The only places they really touch ConAgra's corporate structure is in upper leadership (Lamb Weston has their own President who reports to ConAgra's executive team) and IT.  

Source:  I work for ConAgra/Lamb Weston, and while this was news to me this morning, I'm not really surprised."
2012-08-02 22:02:07,"They'll have the same Enterprise Value. If you're asking if the total equity (both the equity in company A and Company B in total) would be the same, then yes, it should be the same in both of those situations. The two situations below should have the same value. 

Situation 1: 100% A's Equity in A + 60% of A's Equity in B + 40% of Minority Interest in B

Situation 2: 100% A's Equity in A + 75% of A's Equity in B + 25% of Minority Interest in B

They both add up to 100% of A's Equity and 100% of B's Equity."
2012-08-02 18:31:11,"Thank you, it is helpful. I thought one of the purposes of Enterprise Value is to be able to compare apples to apples. 

Lets say there are two company's. Company A is the parent company, and company B is the subsidiary. 

Situation 1: Company A owns 60% of company B. 

Situation 2: Company A owns 75% of company B.

If the Enterprise Value = 100% of liabilities + Equity in both Company A and Company B, you are saying that situation 1 and situation 2 will have the same Equity Value? "

2012-08-02 16:37:20,"Buffet talks about the ""too hard"" pile: I'm throwing this one in that pile. "
2012-08-02 16:19:47,"I agree, although in his later years of investing, with his capital base being so huge leading to the investment world shrinking he has to look more for a behavioral/managerial margin of safety. That's what I have a problem with about the financial markets, not that information is purely asymmetrical but that it's asymmetrical with the incredible amount of insider info and hidden information from companies. That's what increased regulation should mean."
2012-08-02 15:41:48,"I think that even Buffet's Fisherian ideas have a Grahamian kernel, in that moats and management/culture/brand also provide a margin of safety. The interesting question here is the post mortem- how could you have identified how tenuous KCG was 3 days ago. What other companies hide similar risks?"
2012-08-02 15:36:55,"Ok I can see that, and I like the reference to the Graham philosophy I'm trying to apply to today's markets while focusing on other aspects than just the numbers. It makes sense."
2012-08-02 15:11:48,"I think you might as well put it all on black at the nearest roulette table. The problem isn't the $440 million loss per se, but the loss of confidence. They're in a trust business, and they can easily be replaced. They also require access to capital, and nobody is giving it. The assets may have some value, but there is little reason for someone to buy it outside of bankruptcy.
It might happen, of course, but there's far too much risk here. No margin of safety whatsoever. "
2012-08-02 14:37:00,"I see what you guys mean, but you also have to consider that the market has an insane amount of ""flock"" mentality. Especially with personal advisors making up a large proportion, and institutional investors as well, most of them don't want to show significant losses each quarter so those who were holding it at the top must have all sold out at once. Also a buyout from another company is very possible I hear, so they could also get a tender offer around their asset value, which is more than 5x stock price."
2012-08-02 14:33:22,The people driving it down below $3 may have better information than you.  Financial stocks specifically have very high information asymmetry between people in the industry and those who have no access to employee demeanor at lunch.
2012-08-02 14:31:02,"From what I've read, the loss has basically wiped out their cash position and bankruptcy is a real possibility if they do not find additional financing or a merger of some kind. Still a very risky stock at this point in time. "
2012-08-02 03:33:03,"Sorry, I misunderstood that you were asking about the Enterprise Value Formula. Anyways, it makes perfect sense to add back Minority Interest. Here's Why.

Enterprise Value is essentially the value it takes to purchase a company as a whole. So if you're buying the company as a whole, you're essentially buying 100% of the assets. Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Therefore Enterprise value = Liabilities + Equity. Now, if the parent company has 60% of the equity in the subsidiary, then Enterprise value = 100% Liabilities of both the Parent and the Subsidiary + 100% Parent's Equity in the Parent Company + 60% of Parent's Equity in the Subsidiary Company + 40% of Minority Interest in the Subsidiary Company. Since enterprise value is the value it would take to buy 100% of the enterprise, you would not only buy 100% of the parent, but also 100% of the subsidiary and so minority interest must be added back.

It all comes down to understanding accounting. Hope this helped. "
2012-08-02 03:15:16,"Minority Interest on the balance sheet occurs when the company is reporting consolidated financial statements. Essentially, the parent company has controlling interest so all the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are consolidated into the parent's balance sheet to reflect the economics of the company as a whole. A parent company is deemed to have controlling interest when they have more than 50% of stock of the subsidiary. The amount that the parent doesn't own is minority interest. 

Like I said before, 100% of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are consolidated. Now remember that Assets - Liabilities - Equity. Not 100% of the assets and liabilities belong to the parent but GAAP requires consolidation so Minority Interest is required to account for the equity that the parent does not own. "
2012-08-01 23:34:10,ah thanks for the suggestion: i'll do further digging
2012-08-01 23:00:45,"Yeah, it would be a variable coupon rate. Probably linked to inflation."
2012-08-01 22:56:53,"It might mean variable rate. See if you can find other mutual fund's holdings that says fix. If it does, then it's probably that var is variable. "

i did terrible at the beginning, but
there are some good books to learn "
2012-07-31 15:08:31,"Alas I am the definition of beginner, so hardly qualified to send ideas! At the moment my game is running 15 stocks, and I am down 3.42% largely because of the significant bear run on two stocks ESI and APOL both in education and down 40% and 25% respectively. I actually would have sold them at -15% but I decided to let it play as this is something of a learning experience and I want to see if they will bounce back. Anyone have any ideas of how to appropriately detect bear runs? 

Other stocks are FRX, LLY, SDRL, DO, BAC, GRMN, BK, HPQ, LOGI, JCOM, AMT and recent purchase of NOK and AVX. I bought most of these as medium to long positions. I am too tech focused at the moment, so am considering VALE and FLL.

I have added your blog to my regulars!"
2012-07-31 13:01:42,"I understand that they did need the financing to stay afloat, but I'd say the complexities and complications of raising this capital are all part of the mining industry as a whole, they're what you accept when you're buying mining stocks. They only needed to raise the additional capital because of the pay raises they needed to increase the amount of workers, the money didn't go to repairing the mine: http://www.vancouversun.com/Labour+shortage+Mount+Milligan+mine+pushes+development+costs/6223407/story.html 

I'd say that their prospects are good, and the only reasons I can see are that they are short of any other funding means because of problems the mining industry is having: low moly prices, problems with getting workers in the industry and minimizing worker turnover. They seem to be doing well with the mine itself and that's why I feel so positively towards it.

Of course a stock that has declined in price is surely going to have some problems but you buy them on the operating table (paraphrasing Buffett). Obviously companies completely riddled with problems are not on the operating table, they're on their way to the morgue, but I guess that's where your opinion differs with mine. I see them as a good company with a few problems they can overcome whereas you're seeing them more of a decent company with financing and operational issues that may lead into further loss as moly prices and further operational problems continue. 

Thanks for the opinions guys, and I'll make sure to keep investigating. I'm not done with this company's research, but I'm also not saying I'm going to fully pull out, most likely diversify more away from it if I find anything demonstrating poor future performance. Thanks again!"
2012-07-31 12:05:02,You sir! Are A Good Man
2012-07-31 11:23:00,"Hi Guts, They are both in the same industry affected by its trends. But in a commodity business as such, the best execution wins on the long term, I think that one is WDC (see a long term graph between the 2 companies). And from what I see it keeps on executing better (less faults), that's their moat."
2012-07-31 11:12:28,"thanks jack, feel free (as anyone else) to send me your current investing ideas, i'm always looking for new: jvelasco@gmail.com"
2012-07-31 11:05:13,"Great article and gets to the heart of the matter. I am currently running a game on investopedia to see if I can beat the market over a year. In the meantime, my real money is in a low cost index fund with a mix of bonds and shares. I will continue to read through out the year and educate myself, but at the end of the day, I need to assess whether I can beat an index fund. "
2012-07-31 10:40:58,"Once again, I want to reiterate that this company is not the same as it was in the past. It's liquidity profile has changed drastically from what it was just 3 years ago.

The tMEDs are not callable bonds.  They are a security that has a bond and equity component.  The bond portion is relatively straight forward and has a par value of ~$36M at 11.68% interest. The equity portion can be replicated by this portfolio of securities:

* Short 5.3879 Puts (Strike Price 4.64)
* Long 4.5855 Calls (Strike Price 5.45)
* Long Zero Coupon Bond (PV 25)

You are making a huge assumption that everything goes right with building out the Mt. Milligan facility. Even though TC has raised enough capital to complete their project to plan, they don't have a buffer for cost overruns, delays, or random acts of god.  They also don't have much capacity to raise additional capital.  There bonds are currently rated a couple steps above default.  This is the reason why TC had to issue tMEDs and go back to Royal Gold to increase financing through their streaming agreement to raise additional capital.

These complex financing agreements have limited your upside in ways you're not accounting for.  Usually the upside takes care of itself, but in this situation it does not.  You need to do a full valuation in order to determine what your maximum return could be.  If TC succeeds, you will see serious dilution starting at $4.59 and maximum dilution at $5.45.  I'm not comfortable owning TC currently as the downside in too many cases is 0.

Once again, take a closer look at TC.  There are other places to invest where making a respectable return involves less risk.

"
2012-07-31 10:20:07,"Oh yes ok, I think the do, both are in basically in the same market now. But since WDC executes generally better they'll probably make the best out of it.

It all about corporate culture:

2012-07-31 10:03:29,"One thing not everyone realizes about mining stock PEs is that they should be lower because they are a collection of terminal value projects (as opposed to earning streams with theoretically infinite possible lengths).

"
2012-07-31 09:48:44,I understand that you feel WDC is a better managed company. My question was whether the trends that Seagate claims it's seeing have an effect on WDC.
2012-07-31 09:38:31,"After reading the prospectus on the tMEDS, it honestly sounds like they just issued callable bonds that are going to allow them to finance the Mt. Milligan project better. It seems like Mt. Milligan is their main goal on the horizon, and obviously center of focus, but not entirely their source of income. I feel with the $200,000,000 issuance of tMEDS and their increase in net income and equity on the balance sheet for the past few years, that $200,000,000 will go to good use. 

I don't know maybe I sound naive to you guys because you're analyzing far more than me. But as I've said, because it's been profitable for me in the past, I've stuck to Ben Graham criteria, with as much investigating of companies as I can and it still seems that when you look at it from a neutral light, TC isn't too bad, and with a rock bottom price, there's only up from here.

That being said, thanks for the comments and analyses guys. They're not going unnoticed at all. I'm still going to look into all of your recommendations. I'm just saying I'm not going to pull out entirely yet. Thanks, and keep the comments coming, I love intelligent conversation."
2012-07-31 09:27:40,"Yeah I see what you're saying. I don't look much at macro level stuff though, with overall markets and the predictions. I'm trying to really strictly stick to the Ben Graham and Buffett type of stuff. I know that sounds naive, but it's what got me over 25% profit when everyone thought BAC was going to go bankrupt. 

But I do know that moly prices do have to go up, or at least the copper and gold too with the new Mt. Milligan site opening up. I feel with the recession on a near but not entirely probable double dip, that we're near the bottom and the only way from here is up. "
2012-07-31 09:24:46,"I see what you're saying and I can definitely see how the tMEDS can cause a problem, yet they dilute the shares in 2015 due to the conversion; I'm thinking the stock has hit rock bottom and should be able to make it up to at least $5 before anything disastrous happens. Sounds like a gamble but I think it sounds reasonable. And even with the dilution of shares don't you think it wouldn't affect EPS enough to make the P/E above 15?"

2012-07-31 04:45:21,"Thanks, you have just taught me the valuable lesson of not trusting finance websites. "
2012-07-31 02:30:54,"I hate to break it to you but TC is no longer amazing.  I cut my teeth on this company in 2008 when I had even less of a clue of what I was doing than I do now.  Back then, the stock was trading at 0.25x BV and had been profitable during the entire last cycle.  It was simple.  It sold moly and that was it. It didn't have any debt. It didn't hedge exposure to moly. Outside of forward sales agreements, it used no derivatives.  It was happy to operate the Thompson Creek mine and keep everything nice and plain.  I understood what was going on and was confident that if the world didn't end TC would be fine.

TC today is a gamble.  I re-reviewed TC after they issued tMEDs (complex securities) in May.  Complex securities are often mispriced by the market so I hoped I stumbled onto something great.  I did not.  

The tMEDs were fairly priced and the executives at TC bet the entire future of the company on the new Mt. Milligan mine set to open in Q4 2013 and have leveraged the company to the hilt with debt and other financing instruments. If you look at Yahoo/Google Finance you'll only see $370M of ""debt"" accounted for, but when you read through the SEC filings, you see a different story.  Thompson Creek has issued:

* $350M of 7.375% Senior Notes Due 2018
* $200M of 12.5% Senior Notes Due 2019
* $220M+ of tMEDs (contains $36M 11.68% Note Due 2015)
* $400M+ Royal Gold Streaming Agreement (Secured by Mt. Milligan Assets)
* Other Equipment Loans, Capital Leases, and Debt

TC has over $1B in debt-like financing and all of this money will be spent to open the Mt. Milligan mine. This increases the risk of your investment and when combined with the dilutive effect of the tMEDs (Up to 25% dilution), your upside is capped as well.

There are numerous covenants in that debt that will be in danger of being violated. One that they had stayed until the Mt. Milligan mine opens considers them in default if Debt/EBITDA &gt; 3.  If these terms were not renegotiated, TC would be in default now.

They are at risk operationally as this year's global economic slowdown has put pressure on moly prices.  They have sustained EBIT losses for the past 2 quarters and will not make operating income unless moly prices increase.  TC is also currently on the hook for $55M of interest expense every year and I don't know how they're going to pay that and stay within their covenants for coverage ratios. I'm no macro economist, but with China/Europe/BRICs, etc slowing, I'm not sure how moly prices increase outside of a massive infrastructure stimulus in China (It could happen, but I'm not betting on it). 

I'm not sure what you did, but I wouldn't call that research or analysis. Finding good investments is often much harder than looking at numbers and ratios.  You often have to read more than the 10-K/10-Qs to get a good picture of what's actually going on with the company.  I'm sure they'll have this information in the Q scheduled to come out, but you should already be aware of these issues if you're putting your money down.

Read the [Prospectus for TC's tMED and Note Issuance from May](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415020/000104746912005581/a2209437z424b2.htm) and you may change your mind on your investment.  There is huge execution risk in TC's undertaking and if they mess up, or get slowed down by a wall collapse (like what happened last month), or the world goes into recession again, they may go bankrupt.  If they do go bankrupt, I'll be looking at those tMEDs again.  People will probably throw the baby out with the bath water and push those things to zero even though 16% of them are a senior unsecured claim on TC that is publicly traded."
2012-07-31 00:53:38,"I am not an expert, ( I am sophomore aspiring financial analyst), but:

* Diversified mining is not looking excellent as an industry right now, I haven't done much research on this, but this could be due to growing fears of a slowing down economy (including China) that could lead to decreased demand and less sales. 

* The company seems to be financed by debt slightly more than other companies in its industry. With increasing risk of lower sales the company might incur financial stress. 

* Return on equity and return on invesment are lower than the industry.

Yeah, I don't like analyst reports either. I would wait for positive development in the companies industry before buying. I would look at where most of the sales of this company are coming from and watch for signs of increasing demand. "

Not nearly as drastic as I said before, but it will still significantly dilute shareholders when the tMEDS convert in 2015 (adding about 20% more shares total).  

Their stock really has more than baked that news in at this point, though."
2012-07-30 19:28:21,"The good thing about the company is that they are basically a Molybdenum ETF, and there is big upside volatility with the price of the metal.

The downside, is that there is there is no obvious impetus for the metal comming up, and they are basically at break even metal prices atm.  I don't know if they still do, but they used to control the world's molybdenum supply, but it suggests that if they are breaking even now, they no longer do, or something else is wrong.

Even with those warrants looming over them, though, they seem reasonably valued if gold stays above ~$1200/oz when Mt. Milligen comes online.

I did find that their most recent 10-Q publishes the stock compensation agreement, which in my eyes looks very typical of the current trends in tech companies (4 year duration vesting schedule, 25% annually, etc).    Assuming the scale is also similar to the typical tech company, I would be really surprised if their stock awards are more than 20-25% of their payroll.    

Lacking better information, I would use that percentage in your valuation and dilution calculations."

2012-07-24 15:39:26,"read the other comments if tl;dr, just a follow-on to clarify. It all makes more sense when you have a better understanding of how bonds work.

All 3 other comments are correct in my reading, but I would follow it up to cover a minor misunderstanding. Bonds, typically, offer a fixed payout over a period of time. To use EntropicThunder's thought experiment, when I need you to loan me money I offer you two bonds (A and B). The A-Bond I agree to repay at $1 a month for 12 months. The B-Bond I agree to pay back at $0.50 a month for 24 months. You, as the bond buyer (in congress with the other bond buyers) would then basically bid on my bonds - how much is my $1 a month or $0.50 a month worth to you?

The difference then is what you would call the yield. You know I have a job, and the risk of me losing that job this year is pretty bad (though never non-existent). sleffell knows this too. He offers me $9 for my offered schedule of payments (which would be a 33% yield). You offer me $10. He offers me $11. You offer me $11.25 and sleffell decides against raising the bid.

You have bought my promise of $1 a month for 12 months for $11.25, which is an annual yield of 6.25%. Extrapolate this to two years and understand how that time cost (inflation and other factors) and my own default risk (from losing my job, getting abducted by aliens, etc) increases over that amount of time as well. You would bid lower thus increasing the return on your investment. 

Perhaps you only bid $10 on my 2 year (24*$0.50) bond (a nice ~8% yield). After the first year I get promoted at work... after all that time my default risk has decreased greatly (a better job + less time risk). You can then sell that bond to slackie if you want. Perhaps you'll get $5.70 for it. Slackie will get a respectable 5% yield on his investment and you'll have come out of the year with a 17% return on your initial $10 investment."
2012-07-24 15:39:20,"Dont forget that yield curve can invert.  An inverted yeild curve is not strange at all, i.e. if mr. Bond market thinks hard times are coming and rates will fall.  Happened in 08 most recently.  "

2012-07-24 14:43:19,"both slackie and sleffell have good answers, but here's an additional thought experiment that may help: supposed you  loan me 10$, and for one loan, BondA, I pay you 12$ back in a year, and in another loan, BondB, I pay you back 12$ in two years.  Which would you rather own?  BondA: you get the same amount of money, and sooner.  The 1926 bond pays more interest than the 1960 and you get it back sooner.  Actually, to make my example more like graham's, imagine if BondB paid 11$-- an even worse deal since it's less money.

(This thought experiment covers the simple case: I'm glossing over details like re-investment risk and inverted yield curves)"

Read section 8 on page 2... ""At times these included requests made on behalf of derivatives traders at other banks."" 

it doesn't list the banks, and it doesn't specify whether the banks were on the panel or not. to the extent that panel banks can gouge non-panel banks by manipulating rates for specific reset days, imo this represents a big risk for non-panel banks such as gs. to combat this, gs can do a few things: 1) complain about manipulation (very expensive &amp; time consuming), 2) adjust for the risk of being gouged, or 3) participate in the manipulation to the extent they are able, ie by asking a panel bank for a favor - and trying to move libor by submitting higher or lower rates. I realize this is speculation, but i don't think it's unreasonable to assume that gs was involved in 3 to some extent. Does this mean they will be charged with something (market manipulation or collusion)? that's a different story. 

this whole situation is strange: libor manipulation has been in the media since at least 08, barclays - who consistently submitted the highest rates since 08, complained about other banks setting bullshit rates, etc - and yet Barclays is the one who got screwed (to the tune of 450m in fines, a CEO, other management, and 6b in mkt cap). more importantly - libor is private, and so is the bba. as far as i understand, panel banks typically have a ""range"" of rates which gives them flexibility on any given day. it's certainly shady for money market people and interest rate swap people at the same bank to collude over rates - but i'm not sure it's actually illegal

the real story here, imo, is the extent to which panel and/or non-panel banks colluded to move rates. There are certainly emails which implicate this, but at this point i'm not aware of any lawsuits. time will tell.

the yield on debt is 2 percent—a visible number derived from a liquid security—and the equity’s

2012-08-27 15:47:27,"To offer some clairity to the discussion.  The P/E ratio is a useful concept when comparing different asset classes.  For example, a P/E of 10x (or E/P of 10% = 1/10) can be compared to a bond with a yield to maturity of 10% (10x P/E).  This is a useful comparison to 1kGrand - P/E can simply be looked at as (what i pay)/(what i get back).  

ROE is often associated with P/E in finacial text books when trying to decompose the mathematics behind the P/E ratio (usually using the dividend discount model).  Since we know that price is suppose to be the present value of cash flow stream, people often substitute their definition for price for the ""p"" component in P/E.  This often simplifies to (1-b) / (r-g) which is simply your paid out earnings divided by your cost of capital less your long term growth rate.  

For the ""g"" - growth rate - people will use ROE to estimate this long term value.  For example, if every dollar of equity retained is reinvested at the companies ROE than the growth rate is simply your % of earnings retained multipled by the return on those earnings (ROE).

2012-08-26 17:32:56,"How do you value a business? 

It's actually simpler than all the financial talking heads lead you to believe. How much should I pay for a candy store? Well, it's the candy store's assets (building, inventory, etc) minus it's debts, plus annual earnings multiplied by how long you think the business will keep generating those earnings. How do I compare two different candy stores? Well, the one that generates more net earnings given the same amount of resources should be worth more. The store that generates the same earnings with more debt should be cheaper. The store that effectively reuses its retained earnings (by expanding or investing) is worth more. 

It's questions like these that should determine the fair value of a business. P/E and ROE and other stuff are convenient measures, but because they are easily manipulated by accountants, I don't use them on their face value. I do use them to talk to other people about whether a stock is cheap or not, because they don't understand anything else.

Good luck.

2012-08-23 20:49:31,"All good points, I'll do my best to address them

Changes in nat gas/oil prices do represent risk. I am by no means an expert on either subject. Having said that, given the extremely low prices of US nat gas (relative to the rest of the world and relative to oil on a BTU basis), the continued decrease in nat gas rig counts, and the very painful circumstances many nat gas producers have recently experienced, I think there is a reasonable case to be made that nat gas prices will stay relatively flat in the short term. Over the long term, I think US nat gas prices will rise. Even if we don't end up exporting it, utilities and manufacturers will use more of it, and it's possible CNG or LNG becomes more widespread in the automotive market.

Oil is much trickier because it's currently easier to transport and thus subject to arbitrage and therefore the spread between oil prices, like WTI &amp; Brent, is less. So imo, oil prices are basically the result of worldwide GDP mixed in with some politics. Oil prices are obviously highly volatile right now but given the information that I've seen, new wells are profitable only if the price of oil remains near or about $85. And I don't see world GDP remaining permanently subdued over the long term.     

I agree that fracking will not become illegal. I would further speculate that its international adoption will become more widespread. If fracking gets sin-taxed (or whatever you want to call it), I would imagine they would be able to pass at least some of that cost onto their customers as they do with other expenses such as guar/ceramics/sand/water. But who knows

If oil/nat gas prices rise, it's almost certain that their competitors will begin to either re-start their idled fleets and/or buy new equipment. If demand for fracking rises, I don't see this as a bad thing for CJES even if they don't capture all of that new demand (which of course they won't). Under this circumstance, I would expect them to continue growing faster than their competitors, but more importantly it would help alleviate the pressure on fracking prices. I would argue that fracking prices don't even need to increase for CJES to pull out some great numbers. All that has to happen is price stabilization, and the question is when this will happen. I think there are a number of reasons to believe we are in the process of that stabilization.

I used the peer average because most CJES's competitors don't disclose the same amount of information and so netting out the fracking department proved to be very difficult. You are correct to point out that they are not as diversified as their competitors (although it will be interesting to see what they can do with CasedHole over the next year). That is why CJES is trading at a significant discount to basically the entire sector, because their exposure to the US fracking market is so high. "
2012-08-23 20:37:30,Why would you fuss about a $1 difference in price if you have a substantial margin of safety and geared towards longterm investing? 
2012-08-23 16:37:42,"I guess if we look at thesis from the point of view of what could possibly go wrong then the biggest risks in my opinion would be:

* Changes in natural gas/ oil prices
* Increases in investment by other oil/gas service companies that have more cash on hand
* Fracking legislation - I don't think there will be a ban on fracking as a whole however it wouldn't be surprising if some states introduced their own state taxes on fracking.

And lets postulate that oil/gas prices do indeed rise over the coming year, you mention that a lot of companies have had to put many of their fleets on standby and have halted majority of new orders. If prices of gas/oil rise doesn't that make it more likely that a lot of these fleets that have been on standby will be brought online again so CJES may not benefit as much from the price increases.

Another point on your valuation, you are valuing them on EV/EBITDA multiple that is peer average. I think it is also important to remember as you pointed out that CJES has a very high exposure to fracking whereas  these other service companies are involved in a wide variety of business areas so I do not know if would make sense to consider them peers unless you are only valuing the fracking business segments of these other companies."

2012-08-23 10:33:28,"I hear you on the apples to apples. That RBN example was a poor one. A better one is SPN's $2.6b merger with Complete Energy Services. Complete had ~300,000 hp, &amp; ~$800m tangible capital. You could argue this was poor timing on SPN's part, but they still paid 3x tangible book, and CPX was mainly a fracking company. 

The suggestion that I speak with CJES' customers is a good one. I haven't done this. Over the next week I'll see how many I can get a hold of, and if I find out anything I'll be sure to post it here. Thanks for the feedback."
2012-08-23 02:47:58,"Customer relationships and brand power matter to the extent that they can drive earning power on a sustainable basis.  I would suggest you speak with customers in the industry to get a sense of what's going to happen to pricing and hence earning power going forward.  

Look at what would happen to earnings if CJES's return on tangible capital reduced to say 18% due to new competitors investing in its space to earn the juicy returns that it currently enjoys.  That should motivate an investor to make the calls to figure this out because the prospect of that should be extremely frightening.  If you make the calls and find that CJES does in fact have a sustainable competitive advantage that would keep customers from switching to a new entrant, it would be great to hear back from you on your findings.

I would also suggest that only apples to apples comparisons matter when you're looking at valuation.  Different businesses in the same sector face very different barriers to entry, which at the end of the day is what determines whether super-normal profits are sustainable."
2012-08-22 21:21:00,"Thanks for the questions. All my numbers are estimates, the real numbers are very difficult to obtain. According to this article(http://www.thestreet.com/story/11654943/1/marketsandmarkets-global-hydraulic-fracturing-market-worth-64-billion-by-2017.html -- which is a summary of a report that costs over 4k to buy), in 2011 the fracking market was estimated to be about a $31b/year business. If we take CJES's 2011 revenue of $758m, that gives you an idea of CJES's overall fracking market share (very small). Depending on the data you look at, most agree that over 90% of the fracking market takes places in North America. The North American market is relatively mature. 

Efficiency is defined by the amount of stages you can frack in a day, AKA cost per frack stage. Depending on the well, a single well may have in excess of 40 frack stages (and can have as few as 5). CJES can frack 5 stages per fleet per day, which is industry leading. Other companies don't disclose the same level of information that CJES does, so this is a tricky point. From what I've seen, the industry average seems to be about 3 stages per day.  

The cost of drilling a well depends on the basin. In the Bakken, for example, drilling a well costs $8m-$12m per well. CJES doesn't charge on a well-by-well basis. They charge based on the amount of time they work and the amount of raw materials they use. This is standard practice from what I gather. "
2012-08-22 20:47:17,"Thanks for the viewpoint. Aside from fracking prices, the tangible book value is an often-criticized aspect of CJES. Currently the tangible book value is just shy of $200m. If you look at the whole sector, you won't find a company trading at 1x tangible book, and the reason is because equipment is not all that matters. For example, CJES valued CasedHole's customer relationships at $100m, and CJES valued the CasedHole brand name at $25m. CJES could have purchased its own wireline units, and if tangible book was all that mattered then CJES would have done just that. Brand name and reputation are important, as is efficiency. CasedHole is extremely efficient at wireline, and CJES is extremely efficient at fracking and coiled tubing. Their efficiency is evidenced by the rate of their respective growth trajectories relative to the market. 

There are quite a few acquisitions in the oil &amp; gas services sector which you can use to determine how much these companies value tangible book (and I will assume that the people who make these decisions like the management/board of NOV knows more about the industry than I do). Look at NOV, they just bought RBN for $2.5b. RBN's tangible book is $307m. Of course RBN and CJES aren't apples to apples, but the point remains (at least in my mind) that tangible book really isn't the right way to be thinking about this sector. "
2012-08-22 20:13:45,"The problem with not paying dividends is that management is deciding what to do with your money, which doesn't really feel like you own them.

&gt; When a dividend payout ratio is greater than 100 per cent, a portion of the payout is actually a return of capital, not a return on capital.

What is far worse than a return of capital is no return of capital.  Fundamentally, a [stock share can only ever receive a return though dividends or takeovers](http://www.naturalfinance.net/2012/07/minority-shareholder-discount-to.html) unless you can influence salaries and employment

The general solution, IMO, would be giving shareholders the option of a cash or stock dividend.  Companies can compete on high nominal payout ratios, while the good companies would have most shareholders take the tax free stock dividend, the decision would be where it belongs:  the shareholder.  

Take the starbucks example,

You bought the stock 10 years ago because it had a great way to take US yuppies money.  Investing in China proved to be successful, but you might have no clue whatsoever whether the Chinese market would work out for starbucks.  If they had a 100% nominal payout ratio but 50% effective payout (due to stock dividend option taken by half of shareholders), then even if they didn't have enough cash to invest in China, someone else would have backed them.  Someone with confidence and a clue in the Chinese market.

When sbux keeps doubling down and then goes into India, malaysia and eventually Somalia, shareholders may have concerns and it will eventually bankrupt itself.  If you back a gambler, no matter how good he is, you should prefer the right to demand periodic dividends, because doubling down in perpetuity leads to certain ruin."

2012-08-22 16:10:31,"well, duh. but a good company with dividends is even sweeter."
2012-08-22 14:38:42,"Couple of quick questions:

* How large is this industry and what is the marketshare of CJES and their competitors?

* You mention that CJES is ""leading in terms of efficiency for all of their services"" (CJES + CasedHole paragraph). How is efficiency defined and measured? How much more efficient is CJES vs. competition?

* What is the average cost of drilling a well (liquids/oil and dry gas) and the average price CJES charges for drilling a well? Prices will be near bottom when revenue~cost and no profit is made on drilling transactions.  "
2012-08-22 08:27:24,"I've seen this pitched a few times.  I think it is worth looking at what would happen to the company's earnings if barriers to entry are low and competitors can easily enter.  

I'd be worried that CJES's current high levels of profitability and return on capital was just due to a temporary shortage of supply in the products that it sells during the period when competitors were gearing up to enter the market.  To get sense for whether this is the case or not it is worth calling end users (don't ask CJES management because what they tell you will be biased and therefore worthless).  

If you find that competitors can enter the market easily, then it should end up trading at about 1x tangible book after the current high-priced contracts roll off.  Of course, tangible book will grow between today and then because they'll earn excess returns between now and then, so you have to account for that."
2012-08-22 06:38:07,You either buy a company's future earning or you buy it for it net assets. You Have  to quantify the composition and quality of its book value before jumping in.
2012-08-21 21:22:11,"Thanks for the questions.

Their main competitors are HAL, SLB, PTEN, BAS, RES, KEG, PTEN, WFT, BHI, CFW.. etc. A lot of oil/gas services companies provide fracking to some extent. CJES is unusual in that its exposure to fracking, relative to its overall business, is high. CJES builds its own frack fleets for about $32ish million per 32,000 hp fleet. Maintenance capex across the whole company is very low, something like $10m-$15m annually. Their fleets are all relatively new, and so they haven't had to deal with a round of upgrades. I am not sure when this might happen, or how much it will cost. I don't have any insight into how much their competitors pay for new fleets or to upgrade their old fleets. I would like to point out that yes, equipment matters, but so does efficiency. A single CJES fleet can frack 5 stages in a day, which is industry leading. 

I didn't word this very well in the thesis, and so I'll be making some changes to it. Basically, I assumed flat oil &amp; nat gas prices because I wanted to limit my speculation and I didn't want it to appear that changes in these prices were the basis of the thesis. Of course, if oil or nat gas prices rise then fracking will do better, and if prices fall fracking will do worse. Oil &amp; gas prices will most certainly not stay flat as you point out. Over the long term, I think gas and oil prices will continue to rise. Obviously in today's macroeconomic environment, it's very difficult to make short term price forecasts. But over the long run, I feel pretty confident that the prices will rise.  

They are paying LIBOR + 225-300bps (or a base rate + 125-200bps). Covenants state they must retain a leverage ratio of 2/1 or lower, measured by debt/EBITDA, which they pass easily. They have limits to the amount of assets they can sell, amount of new debt they can issue, and a few other things. However, they can now spend unlimited capex so long as: the leverage ratio remains below 2/1, they have at least $40m in liquidity, and this capex does not present a risk to default.

I'm not sure exactly how to answer the type of investment question. If you're asking if it's a longer-term (1-3 years) buy and hold, then yes it is. I do think it is undervalued, by how much is a tough question. If we assume they should be priced on an EV/EBITDA multiple that is the peer average, I am getting a multiple of about 5, and that would make CJES worth $1.495b net of debt, or a 36% increase from today's price. I try to use conservative estimates so I think there is a lot of room for upside. As far as catalysts, the EPA study that will be released later this year should move the price. But because I believe the biggest risk to CJES is the price of fracking, and these prices do not have a well-defined catalyst, I think the story plays out over the next 12-18 months.

I think they are worth at least as much as the peer average, which implies a 36% premium to today's market cap. While the EPA study may end up being a much bigger catalyst than I think it will, I think the frack market will stabilize over the next 12-18 months, and if this happens the whole oil &amp; gas sector should benefit. CJES should benefit even more. At today's price, the market is assuming that CJES never grows its business, and that they will eventually succumb to their competitors. I think the odds of either of those things happening are very small.      "
2012-08-21 18:40:39,"I haven't looked at it in depth but a few questions:

* Who are their main competitors and how much does it generally cost CJES to upgrade/improve their fracking fleets?
* One of the main assumptions you make is that natural gas/ oil prices will remain flat for the foreseeable future, so my question is how long is this period in which you expect these prices to remain flat. They may not change much over the next 6 months but that becomes highly unlikely when you look at a period of 2 or 3 years.
* Since they have picked up quite a bit of debt due to the acquisition and have very little cash reserves what kind of interest rates are they paying on their revolving credit facility and are there any restrictive covenants?
* What sort of investment is it? I think we can both agree that it is in an unloved market but do you think company is currently undervalued and if yes by how much? Are you hoping there will be some sort of catalyst that unlocks value or are you banking on them experiencing some sort growth over the next few months.
* How much do you think they are worth and what sort of time horizon are you looking at?"

Information in this chapter is less specific than what is described in the blog posts above, but it is a good introduction to those techniques."

2012-02-28 02:36:49,"I was in your exact position about a year ago so since I've actually gone through it, here is what I'd recommend based on my experience.

1.)  Contrary to almost everyone else, I found the Intelligent Investor very difficult to read.  If it were not for the Zweig commentaries at the end of each chapter to summarize the concepts and apply them to modern day, I probably would not have bothered finishing it.  I can see how the book would have been revolutionary at the time, but a lot of the concepts are pretty mainstream now (like the index fund) and you will find them in any book or investing website.  I did not find the writing style to be very clear and many parts of the book were clearly very dated (talking about railroad companies etc.).  Based on anecdotal experience, I feel that the number of people who actually read this book and Securities Analysis is far smaller than the number of people who recommend it based on their agreement with Garahm's overall value investing philosophy.  It's similar to how the number of people who recommend classical literature or classical music is far larger than the number of people who actually read or listen to it.

2.) For serious learning, I found actual books far more useful than any internet sources.  Websites like investopedia or kahn academy have solid information, but its usually presented as stand alone concepts which leave out the greater nuance and context, better for review/reinforcement than actual learning.  A blog or forum post does not have the same level of analysis or contemplation which an author is forced to undertake.  

A lot of investing advice is contradictory b/c no one knows for sure how to make money and different environments suit different strategies.  The beginner book I started out with was ""The Dummies guide to Fundamental Analysis"".  I found it to be an excellent beginner book which catered towards non-finance people.  The intermediate book I used was ""Securities Analysis and Business Valuation"" by Hooke.  I'd definitely recommend this book over Securities Analysis b/c its written in modern English and it is one of the few financial books written in hindsight of the 08' financial crisis, something which it goes into great detail.  

3.) Doing securities analysis is not really worth your time unless you have significant personal wealth (which I assume you do not) and are willing to take highly concentrated positions based on your research (less than 5 stocks comprising your entire portfolio).  The reason why its not worth your time is b/c you can do everything right in the analysis and still lose money b/c the market is irrational; it happens all the time.  The payoff for doing something actually productive, like learning a new language is far more useful and secure.  I'd only recommend taking this road if you have significant wealth or simply want to learn the skillset.

4.) Its useless applying these skills to any company that has been mentioned on CNBC within the past year.  You are simply not going to do a better job analyzing Apple than the guy at Goldman Sachs who earns a 7 figure salary and gets inside information/access.  To use a reddit analogy, you want to be the guy upvoting or downvoting all of the ""new"" posts coming in, not the ones which are ""hot"", ""trending"" or ""top"".  This means not bothering with the NYSE and large parts of the NASDAQ; you need to look at the venture exchanges and pink sheets and other bottom of the barrel small fry stuff like that.  The holy grail is that you find some no-name company like Cirrus Logic and do the analysis to realize they were the main DSP chip supplier for IPods before the market did, then you go all in and profit massively once mainstream financial press finds out and the stock skyrockets."

2012-02-24 01:20:52,"*Disclaimer* Total noob here.
Question is for research/learning I have no intentions of investing in MIC

Question: How does the increase in price from news MIC got yesterday about blowing away analyst estimates in Q4 Earnings affect the long term strategy from the OP's article, which seemed to be basing its growth potential on things like reinstated dividends, potentially growing to higher yield dividends upon settlement of internal conflicts, and a more gradual earnings growth rate?  I guess the main question would be...does this new information from Q4 increase the upside of MIC (original target of $35-$37/share) or just help it get closer to its fair market value more quickly?  I was under the assumption that shorter timespan reports like quarterly income statements were relatively uneffecttive means of valuation to value investors.  Is it ""too late"" on MIC with only 15-20% upside remaining on the original valuation?

Funny you should mention that this is a small, and quiet group...based on my limited research it sounds exactly like a bunch of value investors to me...  :P

2012-02-23 12:23:53,Very true which is why I still follow this sub-reddit. 
2012-02-23 08:10:34,"I found the Intelligent Investor and Margin of Safety to be good foundational books, and almost required reading for anyone who thinks about value investing.  Other sources that I've used to educate myself are the book ""F Wall Street"", which is the best value investing book I've ever read, the Motley Fool has some of the best analysts around (not all of them are good, but I would in particular read everything by Morgan Housal over there), and of course every one of Buffett's annual letters.

There are also no shortcuts.  It's not an easy strategy to master although it's pretty easy to get up to speed on the basics. It took me a year or two of investing before I started to get more confident.  And it requires a decent investment in time on your part.  Reading through annual reports, doing research on a company and their products, and really getting a handle on what's going on is time-consuming.

Once you've got your system down and you are confident in it, you'll find that this takes less time.  However, that's years away and it really only works if you build the system and it's tailored to your strengths, interests, and goals."
2012-02-23 06:06:04,This reddit definitely doesn't have much comment activity but the articles are much better than in r/investing.
2012-02-23 03:41:20,"This subreddit isn't dead. To be honest, value investors don't like to talk much we just like to look at value ideas and not some technical chart or apple bullshit. 

1) yes this is an appropriate path. I read intelligent investor first and then listened to security analysis audio book like 100 times each chapter due to my college delivery job (I had a lot of time to kill...3 hours a day driving). Seth Klarman is a blend between Graham and finance academics, but pretty much the same book as intelligent investor.

2) if you want to be successful you are going to have to put the time in...like a lot of it. that's about it. It will be your life pretty much if you want to be top tier. If you are having second thoughts consider being a passive investor as Graham talks about. It's not a bad strategy at all and I recommend it to all of my sister's since I don't want to pick out their portfolios for them.

3) Start thinking on your own and using your own creativity. It is hard to block out the noise that you here. Technically even I am noise...I am trying to persuade you to an idea and I might be right or wrong it will be up to you to decide.

The two main principles you must follow: buy only at discounts and Mr.Market is your friend. The safety of margin is the discount principle and is critical because if you overpay for something it is really really hard to either have the market overvalue it once again or actually have the intrinsic value hit that mark down the road say 10 years from now. Mr.Market is the psychological mess that is the stock market and it's players. You will see wide swings from optimism and pessimism and it will be up to you to stick to your fundamental analysis. A great time for undervaluations is times of fraud etc that is way over blown or just isn't true.

I have been investing with real money for 3 years now and have compounded my wealth at 18% a year since 2009. 2011 was my worse year and I know it was a bad year for most value investors as well, but I am not going to lie 2011 was also the year I tried to use a stock program I commissioned that did my analysis for me. The program was obviously not as good as individual research. 

You should be willing to put in time into researching companies and if you are decently smart you can beat the market. The hardest part is sticking to your guns."

I don't.  Not in the slightest.  And, come on, this is the internet.  I don't know how any value investor can legitimately give a thumbs up on FB at a $75B+ valuation.  Especially in this market, where the best value industries are still spewing FCF at THICK spread to the risk-free rate.

2012-02-14 21:22:27,"I've read a lot of Jae Jun's stuff at OldSchoolValue since he's one of very few people seriously writing on Piotroski, but I have to disagree with his analysis here. You can't simply run a backtest, pick out the best result and call that worthwhile research. Without some logical implication of causality, you shouldn't expect to outperform anymore by asserting that a falling current ratio is better than a falling debt level (how different are these measurements, really?), than if you simply picked out a backtest that shows that stock with names beginning with A outperform those with names beginning in Z. 

Don't get me wrong, Piotroski is a great stock screen and Jun generally offers great analysis, but I think he goes too far in pronouncing his ""6,9,1 combi test"" as the winner in this case. 

Now compare that to his [CROIC Turnaround](http://www.oldschoolvalue.com/blog/investing-strategy/croic-roic-screen-strategy-backtest/) strategy, which to my mind, *does* offer logical causality."

2012-02-12 09:49:24,"Sure.  For me, value investing is a good fit for my natural way of thinking, which is nice because it's also arguably the most successful system around.

The only thing I'm doing is learning everything I can about a small number of companies.  Then I estimate how much the business itself is worth (how much it would make sense to pay for the business if you were going to buy the whole thing), and then I wait for the stock market to give me a chance to buy a piece of that business for significantly less than it's worth. 

I'm from the suburbs of Pennsylvania and I went to school in the middle of the state.  Lots of my friends were hunters, and the way they hunted was to build a platform in an area they knew well and then sit there, waiting for deer to go by.  The trick was finding a decent spot and then not leaving to go chase after something else.  Value investing is exactly the same process."

2012-02-02 21:04:33,"This peer reviewed work addresses how Businesses and Information Technology Security Professionals have spent a tremendous amount of time, money and resources to deploy a Defense in Depth approach to Information Technology Security. Yet successful attacks against RSA, HB Gary, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, the United States Military, and many others are examples of how Defense in Depth, as practiced, is unsustainable and the examples show that the enemy cannot be eliminated permanently. A closer look at how Defense in Depth evolved and how it was made to fit within Information Technology is important to help better understand the trends seen today. Knowing that Defense in Depth, as practiced, actually renders the organization more vulnerable is vital to understanding that there must be a shift in attitudes and thinking to better address the risks faced in a more effective manner. Based on examples in this paper, a change is proposed in the current security and risk management models from the Defense in Depth model to Sustained Cyber-Siege Defense. The implications for this are significant in that there have to be transitions in thinking as well as how People, Process and Technology are implemented to better defend against a never ending siege by a limitless number and variety of attackers that cannot be eliminated. The suggestions proposed are not a drastic change in operations as much as how defenses area aligned, achieve vendor collaboration by applying market pressures and openly sharing information with each other as well as with federal and state agencies. By more accurately describing the problems, corporations and IT Security Professionals will be better equipped to address the challenges faced together.

2012-02-01 07:05:16,"Daily I read the Wall Street Journal and other business news (Google news).  This sometimes leads to new ideas or new info, but usually it's just part of my morning routine and passes uneventfully.

Weekly I check the price of the companies I'm tracking (I manage everything at http://investmentcat.com which is a site that I made to host the tools that I developed over the past 4 years to aid in investment decision making.  Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think).  My wife and I will usually talk over any investing plans or ideas we have and we try to come up with reasons why we're wrong.  This is generally the time when we buy or sell.

Monthly I add new money to my brokerage account.

As for habits, there are tons that are REQUIRED (in my opinion) for being a successful investor and not a speculator:

* Emphasis on not losing money rather than making outsized returns
* Develop your own system based on your strengths
* Say ""no"" when you're not sure
* Never deviate from your system
* Focus on your mistakes so that you can learn from them.  You learn much more when you kick one off the side of your foot then you do when something works out.
* Spend less than you make (!!!)

Once you've got your system down and you have a lot of faith in it (took about 2-3 years for me to have a system and really trust it), then never talk about what you're doing.  I will answer any question about how I think about investing, how I find companies, and what I'm looking at in terms of financial information ... but I never tell anyone other than my very closest investing friends what companies in particular I'm buying or selling."

Impressively, the stock's up ~12% from the disclosure of his position (and plus maybe some additional secular rallying). Wish he would have revealed his stake after the xbox event, which was when I planned to enter.

With that being said, I hope and anticipate more shareholder activism and corporate raiders in Japan. The place is awfully ripe for it: the issue of corporate governance is not a secret, and Japan's continued rally will continue to attract investors who find cases of locked shareholder values. "

2013-05-13 21:34:49,"Personal investing is hit or miss - it definitely shows that you went above and beyond, but unless there are investment firms that are recruiting for analyst positions, you may be hard pressed to find roles where that is wanted. At least for me, that was the trouble, and it's because even though the engineering schools may have had some quant firms, I was specifically interested in real fundamental analysis. My school wasn't recruited from for those roles unfortunately.

The Level 1 CFA exam is something I considered and should have done so I could have finished 2 and 3 sooner. I highly encourage you to do it so that you can get the job you want either sooner than later or even right after college."
2013-05-13 21:21:49,"Level 1 and 2 aren't as bad as I thought they would be - the portfolio/derivatives/etc. stuff really makes me choke a lot, because I disagree with it quite a bit. That said, the more I studied it, the more I realized that the people who put the test together actually knew what they were talking about, because those were probably only 2-3 of the study sessions out of the 18 on Level 2. I like that they forced me to learn the basics of pension plan accounting because it made me realize I should avoid firms with large pension liabilities whenever possible in my own investments.

Overall - it's very much grounded in fundamentals, and I'd say they do a great job of telling you what to watch out for. Example: In capital budgeting, my mind used to always say, ""If the CEO wants project X done, it does NOT matter what the damned NPV or beta is, because no one says no to the CEO, especially when it might only be a $5M project at a $1B+ company. They will realize they are better off staying employed and using their voice on something of importance to the bottom line, not his little pet project.""

Well... the study material calls this issue out, among many, and says you shouldn't bother analyzing those projects. They're going to happen anyway. And then it goes on to list 10 other common mistakes that managers make when allocating capital to investment projects.

Anyway - I like it. I'm not sure I'll be looking forward to level 3, but I'll take it as it comes. My goal is to wind up at a value investment shop that avoids common pressures and can be opportunistic. I'd probably wait tables before I swallowed my pride and bought stock at what I believed was a price above intrinsic value.

I'm currently in an analyst program at a big asset management firm and they give me a budget toward completion that is the equivalent of 3 tests plus study materials and 1 test without materials. (basically means I can fail once and still have it all covered)

IMO, a more relevant argument would be suggesting that there are many people in the top 100 business people list that don't have any degrees/certifications (eg. Bill Gates).

I do completely agree with you that the CFA isn't the be all and end all. It will help to open doors though (and get recruiters to call you)."

2013-05-10 15:39:16,"What I might determine to be undervalued vs. Graham-Dodd is not necessarily the same thing.  I could make a very strong case for Google being a value stock, but traditional Graham and Dodd would argue against that.  

I think finance has evolved a fair bit since Graham and Dodd (though not necessarly that much) and the vast majority of institutional players I've met who claim to be ""value investors in the mold of Graham/Dodd"" are either lemmings following the herd of ""smart guys"" or really not that deep of thinkers when it comes to capital allocation.  There are some exceptions to this, obviously.

Part of Graham and Dodd's limitations is that it didn't anticipate IP rich companies like Google.

With no other information, I would rather an English degree from an ivy league school (and 2 years investment banking in a restructuring group), because the ivy leagues usually represent a filtering process for high IQ people.  I know several CFAs who are morons.  Keep in mind you only need like a 65-68% to pass a CFA exam.  That is nothing.  I would personally make it at least 70%, if not 75% (I passed all of them by a wide margin, on a single attempt).  So if I had to gamble on CFA or ivy league pedigree, I take the ivy leaguer, because CFA doesn't mean that much to me.

I am not an ivy leaguer BTW.  I went to a top ~50 US school."
2013-05-10 14:20:56,"You asked if getting a CFA would help you pursue a career in investing/portfolio management/secruity analysis - the answer if obviously yes, it wont hurt your chances.  

I am casually doing my CFA, not putting myself on any kind of time table for completion.  I am on my level 2, which is very similar to level 1.  Level 3 is much more involved - given you need to write out answers instead of filling in a multiple choice card.

The one point i would emphasize, strongly, is that there is no instruction manual for investing.  The content included in the CFA continuously changes - i.e. MBS, CDO's, etc used to be great - according to CFA - now that we had a crisis, there is an enormous section on the risks.  Personally, i tend to be very cautious around anyone who thinks the CFA makes a difference.

The best thing you can do is to start investing your own money.  Experiance and history make a big difference and are preferred over any degree money buys.

...Last time i checked... Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, Ben Graham do/did not have CFA's."
2013-05-10 14:06:28,"That's the whole point of Graham-Dodd -- buying undervalued stocks. There are some who focus on ""cheap stocks"" as you say and others who don't have such a focus. And... whether they understand how economic value is created is independent of whether they are value investors or not. Personally, I think much of what you wrote there is a lot of illogical twaddle, and I'm surprised that's coming out of someone who has so much industry experience. 

Why is it that you would value someone who got a degree in English from an ivy-league more highly than someone with a CFA charter?"
2013-05-10 11:39:22,"I have a CFA and worked at 3 different hedge funds.  I would say it's a nice body of knowledge.  I can't say that I learned a whole lot, because I already knew most of the material.  There are some aspects of the curriculum that I find weak, particularly in areas of concepts like ROIC.  If you are a CPA with an MBA or finance degree, that's probably just as useful.  Though, CFA is becoming a check the box kind of requirement in the industry due to the level of competition.

I would still probably take a person with an ivy league degree (any kind) and 2 years in banking in a credit/restructuring group over any CFA/MBA dipshit.  Most CFA/MBA people who preach this graham/dodd philosophy don't really understand how economic value is created, per se.  They just know buying cheap stocks works over time."
2013-05-10 11:03:09,"This is a stupid question.

The reason why this is a stupid question, is that the answer is obvious: it is best to be a contrarian just before the momentum changes, and to be a momentum chaser just after the momentum changes. But in fact this is equivalent to saying that you should ""buy low and sell high""; it is literally true, doesn't contain any useful information because it doesn't tell what is high and what is low.

Anyway, happy ""investing"".

2013-05-09 22:44:07,"I have a CFA charter and I agree with you to an extent. The third level in particular is very focused on portfolio management theory. However, levels 1 and 2 provide a really great overview of all kinds of valuation methods from basic DCF models to residual income and other approaches.

Levels 1 and 2 also provide a deep look at financial statements, including how they interact, how to make adjustments and how to notice trends and learn the ""story"" of a business. The curriculum also covers more esoteric topics like pensions, off-balance sheet assets and liabilities and accounting for partially-owned subsidiaries.

Personally, I found much of the CFA curriculum to be quite useful as an investor. Good luck on your exam!"
2013-05-09 22:39:19,"I'm only getting around to writing L1 in a few weeks, but I don't see a lot of Ben Graham in the curriculum... sure, lots of emphasis on financial statement analysis at that level, but the Institute seems to posit that the EMH is proven for all major global markets and security selection is a losing proposition.  They mention a few exceptions (outperformance of small caps, and of value stocks versus growth), but I don't really get the sense that they're supportive of the notion of consistently finding success through deep analysis of companies.  

That said, I can't imagine that the program wouldn't be appropriate for someone wanting to do anything in the area of asset management, portfolio management or individual security analysis.  I think you should enroll immediately after graduation and at least get started on it. "
2013-05-09 22:17:41,"Thank you. I am just debating whether I should take it or attempt to join a firm out of college. I have been doing research and analysis on the side, but I was thinking the CFA could help me get my foot through the door.
"
2013-05-09 21:55:47,"I'm taking the level III exam in a few months, so I can only speak from a content perspective. The CFA textbooks cover mostly modern portfolio theory. Relatively little out of the total page real estate is allocated to actual security analysis, in the style of Ben Graham. It is all very ETF and index oriented. You learn a lot of the technical, mathematical aspects of finance, and a lot of the finance is from the perspective of a pension plan, a bank, or a portfolio manager

I think it is a great thing to aim for, but I'm uncertain if it would help for value investing more than any other style of investing. It will definitely help you get into a career of investing/portfolio-management/security-analysis, though. Many equity analysts and portfolio managers are CFA charterholders. 

Also, it's really hard, which is the main benefit of it -- it is a kind of mark of prestige. "

I have some idea of what the company will look like in 5 years, and there is a disparity between that price and today's value."" Warren Buffett 5/4/13

 ""You need to understand a company's competitive position, but it isn't easy. It isn't math; you need to know the business."" Charlie Munger, Co-CEO Berkshire Hathaway 5/4/13

 ""Knowing the edge of your competency is important. If you think you know more than you do, you will get in trouble."" Charlie Munger, Co-CEO Berkshire Hathaway 5/4/13 

 ""Ever since 2009 we are seeing gradual improvement in the economy. The economy has not come roaring back, but it has not really faltered. Overhang in housing ended about a year ago. We are starting to get a recovery in home prices. Big psychological effect. We don't want to start over-building again. We want housing starts to equal household formation. I think we will move forward. Won't surge, won't stall.” Warren Buffett 5/4/13

2013-05-06 23:02:10,Interesting food for thought clip.  Makes me think of how Warren Buffet never invested in tech companies because he didn't understand the industry.
2013-05-06 22:07:22,"Whitney Tilson is the epitome of the crowded trade fund manager who chases the ideas of talented managers.

2013-05-06 22:03:27,"Slide 15 and 20 at both of the links are identical. If one is crap, then the other is too. 

I know plenty of Harvard educated professionals, some in investment management.  And trust me, they like everyone else screws up. "
2013-05-06 21:51:46,"That can't possibly be the case.  If so, Whitney Tilson, a Harvard educated investment professional who is generally a well spoken individual, has screwed up considerably.

* Consider, slide 15, not updated with 2012 numbers.
* Consider, slide 20, ""thus a 20% premium ... 13% above today's price,"" is completely wrong.

This might be Tilson's report, but it's not available at the link it says it is, it's some scribd crap.  Additionally, it's riddled with errors, and if memory serves, Tilson funds has &gt; 10% of their holdings in BRK.  I think he'd get it right if it was.

Quantitative should serve solely as support/rationale for a target price (aka what price would you buy and what price would you sell). They should be used with conservative assumptions."
2013-05-06 17:07:59,"Great answer. People tend to put too much faith in their models and the numbers. The more financial statements you see, the more you realize how much bullshit is out there.

I look hard at the balance sheet but that's more of a way to rule out companies that survive using risky means (ie, high debt ratio in a business that doesn't need it).  I mostly use DCF analysis, although mine tend to be pretty simple.  I'm not doing M&amp;A I'm doing value investing, so I may spend weeks or months thinking about an investment, but the quantitative part I run through in a few minutes.

On some level, the math we are doing here is all bullshit since we are trying to look into the future.  We know for a fact we are wrong, so the math is just there to give you a direction, IMO."

Nearly 25% of the companies took questions only from “pre-approved lists” of callers. Only 11% permitted individual investors to ask questions; just 12% said the floor is open to everyone.""

While this might seem damning, one place where the floor *is* open to everyone is the annual shareholders meeting - anyone that owns stock can go and they take questions from the audience.  If you've never been to one, I invite you to buy a few shares of your favorite local company and attend the annual investor meeting."

2013-05-05 05:34:15,"Warren Buffett once said that if he was teaching a class how to invest he'd run through lots of examples of investments that have worked out and those that didn't.  One way to do this quickly is to:

-- Sign up for a guest membership on valueinvestorsclub.com.  It is run by Joel Greenblatt who wrote one of the books mentioned by another poster.

-- After logging in to VIC, click 'search' in the top right once to bring up the advanced search menu

-- Search for ideas that were written in the last year or two that have gone up say 40 to 80%.

-- Pick ones that are simple to understand and are from industries that are interesting to you. Read them and you'll learn a ton.  I still use this technique and I've been working as an analyst for years.

It is hard to know in advance what industries will be simple to understand but generally the following makes things easier:

a.  Smaller companies are generally less complicated - less divisions to get your head around etc.

b.  Companies in slow-changing industries are easier to understand.  E.g. tech = difficult, food = easy.  To begin, avoid the fast-changing industries, even if they sound more interesting.  You'll learn the same fundamentals by reviewing ideas in slow-changing industries and the process will be a whole lot easier.

c.  Read the company profile on Yahoo Finance.  If you get what the company does from that, chances are that the investment pitch on VIC will be easier to understand."

You're right though. Once you have a pretty good understanding of how to analyze a business and how to do value investing, then you don't need to read any more about it other than finding interesting stories.

Personally I like Charlie Munger's approach, which is to take ideas from other subjects and try to incorporate them into my investing strategy. This keeps things fresh and makes it bearable to read business books every once in awhile. I switch from history to science, social science, and occasionally get back to a business book. "

2013-06-20 13:33:45,"&gt;At some point an investor needs to shift his focus from value investing to business in general. 
  
Exactly. This is why Buffett and Munger proclaim that they are *Business Analysts* not ""investment analysts"" or ""security analysts"". This is why Buffett says being a businessman makes him a better investor and vice versa.  
  
Value investing is really being a Businessman. Call it business investing if you want. Take the word Investing out of it, altogether. The job is to analyze the business and figure out what you would pay for it to earn whatever return you deem adequate. Punto! :)"

The best example I can give is that the only reason you feel poor at your present level of wealth is because you're comparing yourself to those who have more than you.

2013-06-19 23:42:17,"One approach was estimating based upon past experience, however since there's only a handful of observations covering even 90% of the expected distribution is huge. So that doesn't work so well.

Buffett once said people would be generally better off if they only invested 20 times in their entire life. This implies having a large investment hurdle rate, i.e. hold cash and don't invest until you're really confident you'll get a very high rate of return. 

Berkshire and Baupost keep 20% or more in cash. No idea how they derived that number or what their hurdle rates are though...

Anyone have any analyses or pointers?"

I'd never heard of him before and these are staggering results, but man this guy is a poor speaker and he needs to get his story straight.

Both of these books provide solid walkthroughs of valuation.

If you want the Coles Notes of a simple DCF, here they are:

* Use previous financials to project revenues and expenditures going forward;

* From that, determine FCF;

* Determine WACC and use that to discount FCF into the future;

* If you don't want to forecast into infinity, determine a terminal value using DDM/GGM or some other metric (even BV);

* Add all discounted FCFs to terminal value to determine value of the business;

* Or divide by shares outstanding to determine intrinsic share value.

"
2013-06-17 13:30:55,"I agree with not shorting. I don't do it because of the upside risk has more risk than down side potential to buy. However, the theory behind it is valid. If a company was trading at $100 trillion dollars today I would short it. If this is true then the dummy valuation for this is true anywhere along the valuation line of a given company.

price anchoring is something that makes sense to me, a very good concept to be aware of. 

I tend to just come up with my valuation and compare it with the market cap regardless, but I got what you mean. Thanks!"
2013-06-17 13:29:15,"Well, yeah I am a student. I do have a lot of time this summer before i start working. I have read about 2 books already, and now working on my third. I read fairly fast. This doesn't include my daily WSJ, and blogs though. But reading is very enjoyable and fast if you enjoy what you're reading. "
2013-06-17 13:24:15,"I generally agree, with two caveats:  
  
1. I don't short. Shorting is not really the opposite of going long. Here's a quick reason why, per Warren Buffett:  
  
&gt; “Charlie and I (Buffett) have both talked about it. We probably had a hundred ideas of things that would be good short sales.  Probably 95 percent of them at least turned out to be, and I don’t think we would have made a dime out of it if we had been engaged in the activity.  It’s too difficult. The whole thing about ‘longs’ is, if you know you’re right, you can just keep buying, and the lower it goes, the better you like it, and you can’t do that with shorts.“    
  
Charlie Munger gives a better explaination on why shorting is usually a bad idea, but I can't find a reference off the top of my head.   
2. I think looking at the market cap can ""anchor"" your view of intrinsic value. This is a well known phenomenon in the retailing world (google ""price anchoring). Again, Buffett has said he does not look at a market cap until after he has made his valuation because it can subconsciously skew his idea of value. Once you know what other people think something is worth, your own analysis becomes relative in terms of their view. You're not judging the business on an absolute level, you're judging it in comparison to what others think that level of value is.  
  
Just my 2 cents!"
2013-06-17 13:24:07,"jeez that is a lot haha. You can read all of that in 3 months? You either got a ton of time or are a student? Just bought Charlie's almanac. Either way sounds fun!

"
2013-06-17 13:17:36,"B. graham talked about how so many great business men just seemed to suck at stock investment. Most likely due to a detachment from their business acumen as if the stock market wasn't a market to buy businesses.

My accounting teacher said it best, 

""there are some people that see stocks as pieces of paper to trade and then there are some people that see stocks as businesses to trade.""

Big difference between the two."
2013-06-17 13:11:43,"
You should come up with a valuation and then look at what the market cap is selling at. If it is below your valuation then buy if within your margin of safety; if it is over your valuation then short given a margin of safety (usually double in my opinion of your margin of safety since shorting has higher risk IMO)

Of course this will depend if your analysis is right, but looking at the market cap first gives you no information about the company besides if it is a buying opportunity or not. So I don't think its cheating if you look at it first if that makes sense. Also, don't forget about the shares that are floating for employee bonuses, those are liabilities of the company"

The Value Investors 

The Most Important Thing - Illuminated
"
2013-06-17 12:52:19,"You guys reminded me of a quote I found from a newsletter a couple of weeks ago.  This is from Li Lu:

""Start by learning from the best - listening, studying, and reading. But the most important thing in understanding the investment business is by doing it. The best way to do it is to study one business inside and out for the purpose of making the investment - you may not actually invest. But having gone through the discipline of understanding one business as if you own 100% of that business is very valuable. 

To start, take an easy-to-understand business. It could be a tiny business - a little concession store, a restaurant, or a small publicly traded company. It doesn't matter. Understand one business and what really makes it tick: how it makes money, how it organizes its finances, how management makes its decisions, how it compares to the competition, how it adjusts to the environment, how it invests extra cash, and how it finances the business. 

You should understand every aspect of one business as if you own 100% but you don't actually run it. This causes you to be desperate to understand every aspect to protect your investment. That will give you a sense of a disciplined approach. That's how you truly understand business and investing. Warren always says that to be a good investor, you need to be a good businessman, and to be a good businessman, you need to be a good investor in terms of capital allocation.

Start by understanding one thing within your control that you can understand inside and out. That is a terrific starting point. If you start from that basis, you are fundamentally in the right direction of becoming a great security analyst.""

This really hit my hard.  You pretty much just have to sit down and focus on one company and figure it all out.  Too often we realize how many companies are out there and just want to skim through every company to feel like we're making progress.  However, if you just take some time to read as much as you can about one company you'll have a much better time understanding the business and being able to make a value judgment.  It's all about creating the foundation before building your castle!"
2013-06-17 12:42:37,"Another great idea! Make it easy on yourself at first: pick a random, non-financial small-cap. Small caps are a bit easier to grasp (usually less divisions) and keeping it non-financial means you don't have to deal with all the crazy stuff on the balance sheet.  
  
Just make sure you don't cheat and look at their market cap!"
2013-06-17 12:39:22,"Better yet, do a report on a completely random company and see how you do. When I mean random I mean random; for example, the first stock listed on the DOW or S&amp;P500. 

It's what I did in class for a report and I learned a lot. Also, if you do well, it should give you a great boost of self esteem that you can make it in the industry."
2013-06-17 12:05:42,"Charlie Munger said he doesn't know any smart people who don't read.  
  
Buffet said that being a businessman makes him a better investor and being an investor makes him a better businessman.  
  
Annual reports and management letters to shareholders are great but IMHO they focus a lot on the financial/investment side.  
  
It's important to supplement this information with business knowledge that don't prioritize investment results. This comes from trade publications, industry reports, and newspaper articles not in the ""finance"" section.  
  
Try writing up a report on an industry. Take a niche industry (one I remember doing myself was the Canadian forestry industry) and make a report of it. Try ignoring the actual financial results, just learn what companies in the sector are succeeding and why, and what external aspects are having an influence. Porter's five forces is a good framework to begin with."

2013-06-17 04:16:32,My comment is below. It's long.
2013-06-17 04:12:17,I wrote it because my response is long and I didn't have a couple hours to think about what I was going to say a few days ago.
2013-06-17 04:11:19,"I had to take some time to put my ideas together as this response is pretty long. I'm going to cover how I go about finding undervalued stocks. I'm going to discuss Screening, Special Situations, and Cloning. Regardless of how you come to find a stock, rigorous fundamental analysis, determination of position size, and risk management is necessary for successful investments.

Screening only finds opportunities that are statistically cheap and you're limited by the quality of data and the timeliness of their input. There are numerous free websites you can use for screening. Most of them are shit. The one I like the best is Capital IQ. It's used by firms on both the buy and sell side and it's too expensive for regular people. You may be able to get access at your local university.

I'm not going into too much detail on general screening there are many books and resources cover screening for undervalued opportunities. Off the top of my head you can look at:

* What Works on Wall Street - O'Shaughnessy
* The Little Book That Beats the Market - Greenblatt
* What Works in Investing (White Paper) - Tweedy Browne
* Quantitative Value - Carlisle and Gray
* Security Analysis - Graham &amp; Dodd

Screening techniques are usually used to make basket bets with limited rebalancing. I think Greenblatt has run studies showing that people usually get worse results cherry picking companies from the Magic Formula than investing in a large basket of securities.

Use a variety of fundamental earnings and asset metrics to determine cheapness: EV/FCF, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, Market Cap/FCF, P/B, P/TBV. You can also use their corresponding forward metrics, but you'll be depending on whatever source of estimates the database is using. All of these find different opportunities and some criteria are better used in some sectors versus others.

You can also pair these with return metrics to find magic formula-esque opportunities. Some of the return metrics I've used are ROIC (with and without excess cash), ROE (with and without excess cash), ROA, EBIT/NFA+NWC, and Gross Profit/Assets.

You can also use your screening software to search for net-nets, stocks that adhere to the Graham Formula, and stocks that pass combinations of Graham Investment Criteria. Jae Jun from Old School Value has blog posts breaking down the screening performance of all of these methods.

You can do pretty unique screens depending on how robust your screening software is. You can screen for companies with increasing ROIC which may show companies benefiting from greater economies of scale, operating leverage, or greater utilization of assets. You can add in different capital structure ratios, Altman Z Scores, Piotroski Scores, and all manner of whatever you can think of. The addition of other criteria has diminishing returns and is actually detrimental to the performance of basket approaches. It actually pays to keep it simple.

However, screening in this manner misses companies that are cheap, but aren't necessarily statistically cheap. There are numerous special situations where upcoming changes in assets and earnings create opportunities for enterprising investors.

A few books cover special situations like this. Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman and How To Be A Stock Market Genius by Greenblatt are the two that everyone will think of. Greenblatt's Special Situations classes are posted online and were helpful to me. ValueSlant created a guide that listed 16 ways (mental models) to find undervalued stocks. That was very helpful in moving me more down this path.

Transactions that mark asset changes:

* Post Bankruptcy Equities - Many of these companies can't be owned by mutual funds and are under followed. There's usually great disclosure of the balance sheet in the court documents. You can find those in PACER or you may find some in the company 8-Ks.

* M&amp;A Activity (Mergers, Divestitures) - Mergers change the earnings power of companies especially once their industry consolidates to a few well behaved players. Look at WDC/STX as well as HTZ and the car rental industry. Divestitures can furnish balance sheets with cash that will come back to shareholders as long is management are responsible capital allocators.

* SPAC Merger Warrants - SPACs usually have a ton of warrants in their capital structure. Once they find a company they want to buy, they usually end up buying off the warrant holders so pro forma ownership isn't completely diluted.

* Spinoffs/Splitoffs - Discussed to a great extent in ""You Can Be A Stock Market Genius.""

* Conversions (REIT, MLP, Income Trust) - Each of these conversions affects how earnings are taxed. As a result of more money coming to shareholders, stocks undergoing these transactions are rerated.

* Mutual Thift Conversions - [This research can explain this much better than I can](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=businessdiss)

* Large Share Repurchases

* Rights Offerings

* Liquidations

Events that mark changes in earnings:

Temporary Issues - Provided that they are indeed temporary the market will often overreact to these events and push stock prices well below fair value

* Earnings Misses/Lower Guidance
* Bad Division Obscuring Profits
* Lawsuits
* Recalls
* Natural Disasters

Other:

* Exchange/Index Delistings

* Heavy Insider Buying

* Inflection Point Stocks - Companies that will be going from negative to positive Earnings, EBIT, or FCF in the coming year. Also, companies that will be paying off their debts within the coming year.

Many of these situations can combine in one investment. For instance, last year IRBT went from $37/share to under $17/share in 9 months. They missed earnings guidance numerous times and reduced forward guidance. When you looked closer, there was one division hiding the profitability and growth of the other division. Earnings would hit an inflection point and begin growing again next year even if the bad division didn't turn around. Even though the company didn't look statistically cheap due to depressed earnings, these mental models could convey that there was something there.

Some of the transaction based situations can be found using their SEC form numbers and searching for them in EDGAR. The best free tool I've found to find some of these situations is Google Alerts. It will search all press releases and news stories for certain word strings. Some of the other opportunities are best found looking for 25-50% price drops in relatively short periods of time (2-3 quarters) or under performance versus the greater indices.

Cloning other smart investors. Looking at 13-Fs and 13-Ds of activists and general hedge/mutual funds, especially for new positions. Use this as an exercise to working your way backwards to figure out justification for buying a stock in their portfolio. Don't worry if you can't figure it out. There are plenty other stocks to look through. Conveniently, there is a list of great value funds on the sidebar to examine.

There are lots of great blogs out there that you can follow. I've found that some great ones are now defunct. Easy to keep up with this in your RSS reader of choice. Or you can keep coming here and people will post interesting things.

If you use all of these methods, you'll have no shortage of ideas to examine. Once again, this is only the starting point and much work has to be done to turn this pool of ideas into successful investments."

2013-06-17 00:44:29,"There really is no magic secret to what Warren Buffett does.  He sits in his office all day and reads newspapers and annual reports.  He does calculations in his head.  To top all of that, he has 60 years of experience behind him.

Read as much as you can and start to learn.  Knowledge will compound on top of knowledge.  Read directly about publicly traded companies and supplement that with other studies in financial accounting to fill the gap so that you can learn how to analyze the financial statements.

Limit the amount that you read on theory.  At some point if you want to get ahead you have to read directly on the topic you're going to invest in, and that is specific companies.  

Select a group of stocks you want to start with, say, 50M-300M market cap, and then make it a challenge to skim/read-through every single one of those companies.

Try to read one annual report per day.  In 1 month you'll read 30.  In one year you'll have read 360 annual reports.  By then you should have a good idea of what makes a company absolutely terrible, what you don't understand and pass up immediately, and companies that make you take a second look.

In the mean time, just read something.  Reading anything is better than reading nothing."

2013-06-15 01:02:16,Stock is up 30% today...coincidence?
2013-06-14 16:46:21,"Conceited? I stated up front that I am not right. But I can call bs when I see it. If you take questioning as conceit, I'd ask you to reconsider your approach. 

Useless because of all the factors I've exhaustively explained. Beta, risk free rates, market premiums, etc. Has this not been clear?  I apologise if there was a lack of clarity. "
2013-06-14 16:34:28,"I wasn't using the fact that people devote time to them to argue that the models they produce are correct, I was using it to argue that you should not be so conceited in your opinions.

If you've done so many and you at least agree that the research backing them up is useful, then why would you call them useless? This is starting to sound like a troll."
2013-06-14 16:02:28,"Um, cool?"
2013-06-14 16:00:20,"Not really sure what you mean by that beginning statement; seems like a conundrum. 

Lets say hypothetically that we now multiply the monkeys, who throw literally randomly at a number of 50-100 for the share price of some stock that closed at 50, to 50% of the demand market for a given stock. Wouldn't that effect beta? 

I like to treat business risk as if I were running a small business. To me a corporation is just a big small business. It has advantages, disadvantages, competitors, profits, prospects etc. I come up with a valuation and then wait for the pendulum to swing within my safety of margin. 

I can't tell you if there is something better than beta because I personally don't believe beta is good at all. I'm pretty sure I have made my point on why beta isn't sufficient with the monkey example. I am no pro or scientist so I can't exactly detail everything in a thesis (well maybe I could, but time is very valuable to me). I guess we are both biased? 

Why are you so in love with the concept of beta? Did you learn it in college and have been indoctrined to trust it as word or do you actually think it makes perfect sense with no flaws? 

You might really like black scholes model which I think is better than CAPM. It pretty much takes every possible state of the business prospects and pops out a valuation; however, I think its flawed too because you could easily cross out some possibilities from the infinite possibilities as irrational so why give it a microscopic expected value?

I believe most academics just try to make beta sound fancy and all encompassing. In reality, I'm pretty sure they just need something to write research papers about to get paid. I know CAPM won a nobel prize etc. I'm just not a believer that listening to everyone is the best solution to find out business risk or valuation. Not saying everyone is wrong, but I would rather listen to a few very intelligent people than day traders and all the noise, fear mongering, price dips, price jumps etc. 

I want peace and hopefully my conviction on the valuation is correct. So far I have made only one mistake (it was a big one relative to my money) but damn who would have thought auditors could lie? bastards."

2013-06-14 15:54:47,"That is another large extrapolation on your part. I said creating DCFs is largely useless. That people pay for it shows its not. And just because someone devotes a ton of their time to something does not mean that it is right. That's very faulty logic. 

I've created more DCFs than I care to count. I agree that the research behind it all is extremely valuable. Understanding the things you mentioned are immensely important. Its how you value them that I take exception to. Your are advocating using 3 very imprecise values, adding a semi-imprecise growth factor, and then coming up with a value. Sounds like reading sheep guts to me. "
2013-06-14 15:38:29,"Here is an interesting write up of NWLI from Horizon Kinetics.   

http://www.horizonkinetics.com/docs/CC_112_Jun13.pdf"
2013-06-14 15:22:18,"You do realize that some people spend a good portion (if not all) of their days creating DCF models, don't you? And that someone likes the information they provide enough to pay these people to create them? During your MBA, did they teach you that some people might take offense to their jobs being called useless?

I would strongly recommend you spend some time creating DCF models for real public companies, because I believe you will find that the final ""enterprise value"" or price per share that you arrive at is only a small piece of the insight they provide. The process that you must go through to create them is what really provides the most value - you are forced to look at every piece of the puzzle and decide whether/how it will change over the coming years. Are COGS as a % of sales increasing or decreasing? Will capital structure be forced to change due to expansion plans detailed in the 10K? How will treasury method shares dilute EPS in the coming years? The list is a mile long."
2013-06-14 15:02:55,"The monkey would have to change the price of the stock without changing the price of the market for it to effect beta. And if they are uncorrelated because the price of one is being determined by the money, then beta should reflect that by being close to 0.

Is there a better historically derived proxy for business risk than beta? With predictions about the future, and analyst may have a better idea about business risk, but that can't be quickly surmised with a simple spreadsheet."
2013-06-14 14:55:51,"1) Yes
2a) Roic mean reversion happens in the 3-5 year time horizon. So we should care. 
2b) How's can we predict something we don't even have a handle on currently? Predicting would be second order though, right? If you buy based on current conditions, you're imolicitly predicting a going concern at current levels. But not grow th explicitly. 
3) So we would substitute experience for data? Say you measure 5 year weekly betas to be 1.2. You would use experience to subvert that and say its actually 1.4?  As a side question,  what constitutes being ""pretty good"" at selecting betas?"
2013-06-14 14:47:37,"Yea, but over longer term horizons (3-5 years according to Thaler), the overwhelming majority to not make econimic profits. Thus,  wacc=roic. "
2013-06-14 14:35:40,"Clustering around a mean is different than everyone being the mean.

EDIT: Simple example - two firms in the same industry with very different debt loads/capital structures would have different volatility."
2013-06-14 14:33:15,"1) No practical use? Then what would you propose we use for WACC? The industry ROIC? 

2a) They're very educated guesses, and over the long run, yes, they will revert to standard returns. But who cares? As an investor or analyst, you're worried about what the target is doing for the next few years.

2b) You simply calculate your estimated WACC for every year of the model - typically a DCF model. Security Analysis is all about making predictions - if you can't make predictions, just throw in the towel and put your money in an index fund.

3) As I said before, with experience you can get pretty good at selecting which beta will be the most accurate. 

If the $1m can be mostly classified as an expense (e.g. R&amp;D), then there's no profit and no tax. If it was capex, then you would be right."

2013-06-14 05:53:46,"The problem with removing all nonrecurring costs from profit is that for many companies, different 'nonrecurring' items just so happen to occur almost every year.  Some management teams think the resulting inflated 'earnings before nonrecurring items' will boost the share price and make themselves look good.  I disagree, I think the market tends to assign low multiples to these kinds of companies.

I think the spirit of what Graham is saying is to analyse closely items that are significant to your valuation and accept management's word on those that aren't since they're not worth your time to analyse.  Since nonrecurring items tend to show up in a lumpy fashion, rather than assuming last year's recurring items continue indefinitely, another approach might be to take an average of nonrecurring items from the previous 5 years and use that instead.  Obviously you have to do a sanity check on whether that average makes sense based on your own analysis."

2013-06-14 01:41:49,"That was one of the ways I thought about it too, but it seems that with companies with small net incomes you would be removing almost all nonrecurrent items and with companies with large net incomes you would remove fewer nonrecurring items.

2013-06-13 20:28:18,"I prefer to screen by operating characteristics (healthy margins, revenue growth) and filter out highly levered firms.  
  
Or I just search for low PE or low PB :)"
2013-06-13 20:28:11,"You are right that it is essentially an opportunity cost. What we do when we estimate the required rate of return on equity and debt would be the Opp costs on what the providers of capital can otherwise get, on a similar risk investment. (Hence the different debt ratings, and the different equity r).

However, if we were to screw wacc and substitute our desired rate of return, that is actually what most PE firms will look at. In essence, they will have a hurdle rate of return, (etc 33% per yr for 3 yrs or 100% over 3 years), and then any potential investment's IRR will be measured against this desired rate of return. 

Only problem comes with uneven cashflows (where IRR is difficult to estimate), but thats another story for another day. 

No different. To paraphrase Aswath Damodaran, even if we are horrible are prediction, to make any sort of informed guesstimate will involve some form of prediction. What the analyst will do would be to look at historical trends, future expected products, broad industry trends, to come up with a growth rate for the company in question. And the thing, you don't have to be right for like 20 years. As long as you are reasonably accurate within the next 5-10years, you will realise that majority of the value is locked up in it those beginning years. 

And what if it never grows? Well, thats where all the statistic come into play. To take your washing machine example, you now have a history of all prior washing machines. Maybe your machine is better, or a newer design, and hence its operating parameters may be slightly different. But you still can be able to have a reasonable estimate on the working life of the machine and its potential output. 

As a analyst, no one is really expecting you to be accurate to the dollar (regardless of what you see on line for example where they quote Apple shares hitting $1000/share etc), what their models show them is a range of values, and the price that they eventually publish is merely the most probable price, (based on sensitivity analysis on the growth rates etc). 

And as you can tell, this wont help if its an entirely new industry (etc google/yahoo circa 2001-2004). And this, is why their share price has increased so much, as estimates of growth changes from year to year, as people gradually understand more and more about that industry. 

tl:dr: PE firms does use a desired rate of return as benchmark. Growth is something to estimate base on historical trends and future expectations. So not pure guessing but rather a guesstimate is involved. 

"

I'll give you an analogy - we all know CPI is 1 measure of inflation. One of the Federal Reserve branches publishes a ""sticky CPI"" measure to show what stickier prices, like newspapers dispensed by a machine, charge. Due to the mechanical cost of changing the prices in those machines, they don't update pricing nearly as often, plus who is going to carry around pennies that might be needed for small changes in prices? 

The pricing may not move in lockstep, but over the long run, it should work out. (Again, labor is only one component, so it will generally move with total expenses)"

No, I am assuming that the employees are paid at approximately $9/hr, which is given by Glassdoor (excluding kitchen manager). Since I assume that the states will win the legal cases, Chipotle has to the raise the minimum wage from $9 to $15 gradually ending 2021. I believe this is more likely as Chipotle own all of their restaurants, and other restaurant chains, such as McDonald's, YUM!

So let's say you have some xyz company with very low book value just because it's a service company with extremely high cashflows etc, but you're like what is the worst you could get toasted? you do some NAV and you have like a 30% downside, but hey man if a crisis happens you know what you have in worst worst case.

2016-04-11 12:03:59,"I'll give you a basic example of a company I held shares in recently.

Greenlight Capital RE. If you take a pure quant view of the company, it looks cheap. It's trading for less than its book value, and experiences enough growth in Total Investment Portfolio to easily sustain any losses from insurance claims. Investment revenues account for the majority of the company's value. Historically, it's traded for around 1.5 - 2x book value. 

However, if you dive deeper into the company, you realize that the overall growth in their investment portfolio is a result of additional capital raised by share sales &amp; use of the float (not a bad thing). If you take the cost basis of investments, the investment portfolio has only produced an averaged annual return of 7.52% over the last 10 years, even though total investments, which are accounted for using Mark-to-market rules, show an increase of over 12% per year. The difference between the two returns is a result of the 2/20% fee structure the company pays David Einhorn to manage the investment portfolio. Furthermore, if you do some digging at the SEC, you can pull up these individual investments that comprise their portfolio and see that since its last SEC disclosure in December 15', the portfolio has lost 4.99% of its value. Therefore, an astute investor can have advanced knowledge, months before the company files its quarterly report, of an approximation of what the company will report. This results in a decrease in book value for the coming quarter, if the portfolio continues in its decline. Since the market price has closely followed book value, that means there's a greater potential for a stock decline than an increase. 

A purely quantitative approach to valuing this business would produce quite the opposite perspective. 

Unless you read the SEC filings, you wouldn't know this. Therefore, what first looked like a good investment, ends up becoming a very mediocre one. That's one example of ""understanding"" a business. "
2016-04-11 11:17:09,"When you say ""understand the business"", what's behind that? Could you flesh that out a bit more?

For example, if a person eats at a restaurant, he knows it has at least one location, waitstaff or order at a counter, a glimpse of the menu items, maybe a glance or two into the kitchen, and the prices, etc. Viewed in isolation, without any knowledge of the financials, is it reasonable to assume that he has a good handle on, not only the customer-facing experience, but the actual business itself?"

Present value of next 5 years cash flows:
    $35,586

Terminal Value
    Terminal Value = FCF2020 × (1 + g) ÷ (Discount Rate – g)

    Terminal Value = $10,388 × (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.45% – 2.2%)

Terminal value based on the Perpetuity Method where growth (g) = 2.2%:

Present value of terminal value:
    $113,898

Current discount (share price of $96.42): -5%



Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.

    Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)

    Discount rate = 8.45% = 2.23% + (0.8 * 7.77%)



Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).

    Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))

    0.584 = 0.539 (1 + (1- 30%) (12.02%))

Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.8


Assumptions
The risk free rate of 2.23% is from the 10 year government bond rate in United States.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet)."

2016-04-11 04:00:46,"No you fucking moron, your point doesn't refute anything. Buffett uses Owner Earnings which has nothing to do with EBITDA. EBITDA doesn't include interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization.

Depreciation is not a non-cash charge. 

There's no reason to ""compare"" businesses. Warren doesn't ""compare"" two businesses that have nothing to do with one another. Just because they work within the same industry, doesn't mean shit. For example: you and I are both male, but I'm the only one between us that is an intelligent man. 

Until Moyer does anything other than sell books, I might be interested in his opinion. He's just a book salesman who's never beat the stock market using his illogical theories. 

""Beware of geeks bearing formulas."" - Warren Buffett.

You're a geek. LMAO. "
2016-04-10 21:00:03,"My first point and my reference to Moyer directly refutes this, you fucking moron. If you read any of Buffett's writing on his investment ideas you will also find that he uses EBITDA more often than not.

Reference for your dumb ass as this is an educational subreddit:
""The general rationale for adjusting earnings for depreciation and amortization is that both these expenses are ""noncash"" accounting entries; therefore, including them understates cash flow. This is literally true, but in the case of depreciation the stronger rationale is that firms should be compared independent of historical capital investment decisions. For example, what if Firm B had an old plant that, because of the then existing technology, required lots of equipment for different processes that needed to be upgraded to keep up with the evolution of the final product? Firm B's plant also happens to have been built domestically in a region with relatively high wage rates, high energy costs, and strict environmental standards. In comparison, Firm A built its plant with the newest technology (Which, although more expensive per machine, greatly reduced the number of processes) in a third-world country with lower wages and environmental standards. The depreciation expense of Firms A and B could be very different. Both firms' depreciation charges are noncash and distort cash flow, and thus adjustments hsould be made if trying to measure cash flow. But the larger point is that historical capital investment are fairly irrelevant in determining the value of Firm A or B. In our example, Firm B has a larger investment in PP&amp;E, but Firm A's plant could have much more cash-generating potential"".

2016-04-09 23:17:41,"DCF requires a number of assumptions so it would be hard to arrive as a standard ""fair value"".

Personally, I think these tools can actually be bad for investors.  By doing all the calculations, and making the final results readily available, it reduces the mental load of the investor.  As a tool maker, this is what you want.  As a investor, it a bit worrisome, as it can potentially affect one's ability to think critically. 

Another issue is that the precise numbers gives a false sense of accuracy.  As Buffett said, ""It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.""  Going through the process manually, you know how imprecise everything is.  By making all the numbers readily available for investors who don't necessarily understand the ambiguity of the assumptions, it's actually very dangerous, especially for the less experienced."

2016-04-09 19:12:30,"The flaw is the result of not understanding what ""Fair Value"" really is.  Saying a DCF model is flawed is like saying a hammer is flawed because it cannot drill holes. Fair value has many different meanings depending on who and how you ask the question. Fair value is based on what you believe is an acceptable rate of return. If you feel 5% is an acceptable ROI, the fair value of a stock is much higher than if you feel you need a 15% ROI. You should recognize that this is the discount rate, which is the most sensitive of parameter in the DCF model.

I had a look at FinBox. It wants me to pay money to unlock the ""Fair Value"" numbers for a stock. But will it at any point ask me what I feel an acceptable rate of return should be? Probably not. That means that any number they show as the Fair Value is automatically wrong, for the reason that they aren't disclosing how they arrived at it, and especially because they have not asked me for the most important parameter. What good would the fair value number be if I cannot know or control the discount rate that they use?"

Theoretically, if the DCF model is correct then the market should eventually realize the intrinsic value, but keep in mind that the market isnt always going to recognize the value in fact it might swing (like a pendulum thta Graham talks about) and on top of that you could be wrong on your calculation so the pendulum swings can scare you too because you could be wrong.

2016-04-09 12:57:57,"""Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a “non-cash” charge. That’s nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. Imagine, if you will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their service (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years). In the following nine years, compensation would be a “non-cash” expense – a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset established this year. Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten would be simply a bookkeeping formality?"" - Berkshire 2002 shareholder's letter...dumb fuck."

2016-04-09 11:36:00,"To say a DCF is the fair value price you first have to assume that the model you've constructed is correct. This entails the hundreds of assumptions going into revenue build, projected balance sheet , free cash flow calculations and wacc being correct forecasting out into the future. As you can see the exponential numbers of combinations of assumptions you make, which are essentially educated guesses, make the ""true"" model almost impossible. In terms of predicting future price you then have to account for future information that gets added in - so analysts are constantly adjusting their model as new information comes out (qe, industry data, general economic data etc.)

Where DCFs can be useful to serve as a sanity check and to see how your predictions affect the implied share price. The process is incredibly useful also because it forces you to work through a company in entirety. Furthermore it serves as a way to compare yourself to the street as you can essentially deconstruct their models to see what assumptions are baked into then. In general I am very skeptical of the accuracy of DCFs and for some companies notably those tied to commodities they may not make sense at all.

2016-04-09 10:21:14,"The calculation on that site is completely wrong and should be ignored.

But if you really want to know what you're doing, you can decipher it by looking at the Javascript. Here are the two parts it boils down to.


1) Guess what Book Value is in 10 years and discount it back to today

You start with a Book Value of $21.21 that grows by 6.924% for 10 years. In Excel this looks like:

    =21.21*(1+0.0692)^10

Which gets you a $41.23 book value in Year 10.

You then need to discount this back to today. The website does this by using the risk free rate of 1.71% (which is pretty flawed!). To get the amount to divide that above figure by, do this in Excel:

    =(1+0.0171)^10

Which gets you 1.1848.

Divide the first number by the second number to get $34.95, which represents forecasting the book value out 10 years, then discounting it back to today.


2) Counting the dividends

The website assumes you get your 60c dividend every year for the next 10 years, or $6.00 in total. You need to discount this back to today's value, so you can either discount each individual cash flow (60c at year 1, 60c at year 2, etc) back to today, or you can just use the PV formula in Excel for valuing a series of cash flows, like this:

    =PV(0.0171,10,-0.6)

The three variables refers to the discount rate, the number of payments, and the payment amount (it's negative because you receive the 60c, not pay it). This formula gives you $5.47.


3) Adding it up

$34.95 + $5.47 = $40.43


**Now remember this is completely flawed and should be ignored.**

If you want to think about intrinsic values, the best way to do it is to get an intuitive understanding first. I'd do that by ignoring stock/company analysis for a moment and making sure you understanding the time value of money and present values.

Would you rather have $100 today, or $100 in 5 years? Everyone should say they'd prefer $100 today, which means $100 received in 5 years time is worth less than $100 today. That's basically the concept of time value of money -- to equate $100 in the future to a value today, that $100 needs to be discounted by some interest rate.

Now that you know that, the key to valuing any investment from bonds to properties to stocks in an ""intrinsic value"" way is to work out (1) what the future cash flows will be and when you'll receive them, and (2) what discount rate you'd like to value them by.


**If you want a solid understanding of how you should look at these things, I'd highly recommend the Khan Academy series on Finance and capital markets: https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance** -- particularly the Present Value one under ""Interest and Debt"", and the interest ones beforehand if needed.

2016-04-09 10:08:20,"Valeant has been purposefully vague about many things, not the least of which is the internal investigation.  If it has been disclosed (which I doubt), there has been no indication of who precisely assisted the Ad Hoc committee (remember, the members of this must be some of the very same directors who blessed Pearson's moves)-that is, was there a law firm (hopefully not a firm that is doing/has done legal work for VRX and thus is entirely not independent) and a forensic accounting firm (hopefully not VRX's auditors).  Equally undisclosed is the scope of the internal investigation, a fact that often is disclosed in order to make full and fair disclosure.  My guess is that the internal was confined to Philidor issues since it was conducted in the space of four months, a period way too short to meaningfully investigate other issues in a company the size of VRX.  Interestingly, the internal investigation may be over, but are the SEC and DOJ investigations done?  I doubt it and that continues a risk factor about undisclosed irregularities.  So, in any event, if VRX intends to file its belated 10-K in April or May, the CEO and CFO are going to have to make certifications under SOX and the BOD is going to have to bless/sign the 10-K.  Call me overly risk averse, but I would not be a signee of that 10-K.  Nor, for that matter, would I be a buyer of VRX securities."
2016-04-09 08:05:57,"Let's address the book value issue first. Are you familiar with a geometric mean vs an arithmetic mean? The website is doing a geometric mean. I can explain what that means if you like. But the mistake you made is you entered the wrong number of years.

You count the number of years for a geometric mean calculation by counting the changes. In your example, there are 10 changes, i.e. 1.81%, 10.41%, …, 0.00%.

Or you can just do 2015-2005 = 10 years.

There are at least two ways you can calculate geometric means in Excel.

=(21.21/11.61)^(1/10)-1

or

the Geomean function

Beware, the geomean function will throw an error if there's a negative % change. It's a simple fix tho. You just keep all change in (1+r) form. So 5% becomes 1.05 and -5% become .95. 

Both are nice to know. The first because it doesn't require you to figure out the percent changes for every year, like the geomean function. Which makes it more practical for when you don't have a spreadsheet in front of you. And the geomean function is nice to have to double check to make sure you have the formula right.

Ill be back later to answer the first part of your question.

edit:

This is going to sound like a copout, but youre better off ignoring his intrinsic value calculator. It's a piece of crap, and by no means would Warren Buffett ever use anything remotely similar. I dont have the inclination to figure out the exact calculation he's doing, but from the rule of 72 I know that he's essentially starting with a book value and compounding it at a rate close to 7% for 10 years to get the intrinsic value. The dividend is pushing the value up and the discount rate is pushing the value down, resulting in something just shy of 7%. 

The crux of the whole thing is that book value doesn't matter for most firms."

Sometimes in investor conference presentations there is a slide that has the logos of a bunch of customers depending on what type of business you're looking at.

2016-04-08 15:34:49,"1) Could you elaborate on how your analysts avoid value traps and adjust for quality/growth whilst sorting stocks into quartiles based on Price to Value? So, for eg. how would they ensure that a high RoIC stock with a high PE makes it to the long list. Is this process rule based - say similar to a magic formula sort on RoIC and multiples or is this more discretionary - accounting for upside to downside risk from the bottom up models.
2) Does your process use quant models for time-varying expected returns or market timing? Though I reckon that both the spread portfolios, and adjusting positions for volatility does that partly. 
Thanks. Great chat!     "
2016-04-08 09:02:07,"Thanks!  That's very helpful.  After reading the [reg](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.355-7) I see the answer to the second part of my question (i.e. why some transactions can be done before the two-year window expires):

*all facts and circumstances must be considered to determine whether the distribution and the acquisition are part of a plan. For example, in the case of an acquisition (other than involving a public offering) after a distribution, if the distribution was motivated in whole or substantial part by a corporate business purpose (within the meaning of § 1.355-2(b)) other than a business purpose to facilitate the acquisition or a similar acquisition of Distributing or Controlled (see paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section) and would have occurred at approximately the same time and in similar form regardless of whether the acquisition or a similar acquisition was effected (see paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section), the taxpayer may be able to establish that the distribution and the acquisition are not part of a plan*"
2016-04-08 08:26:53,"The answer for two years is because that is the IRS prescribed time period after a spin-off during which they will presume the spin-off was part of a plan or scheme. See Treas. Reg. s. 1.355-7(b).

There is unfortunately no way to tell whether a transaction like this will occur in advance. Corporations can create anonymous shell companies for stuff like this and do so all the time."

I was wondering - why do some companies have to wait 2 years after a spinoff before another can buy them out without adverse tax consequences related to the previous spin whereas othertimes the spin can immediately be bought out?

I also wondered, is there a legal document 'canary' that might signal a coming merger for a post-spin entity?  For example, would the re-organising parties set up a delaware entity or something that would be registered on a public registry of companies?"

2016-04-07 14:42:07,"For those of you who give a shit, the reverse Morris Trust transaction is a tax law designation describing a structure in which a tax-deferred spin-off under Code section 355 is combined with a tax-deferred reorganization under Code section 368.

In the original Morris Trust case, the court blessed a transaction in which ""Distributing"" (the parent corporation) spun off some unwanted assets and then either merged with or was acquired by a third party in an interconnected transaction.  Eventually, Wall Street abused this structure by using leverage to the detriment of certain shareholders, so Congress outlawed the Morris Trust structure in the Tax Reform Act of 1997.  I will add that this change screwed over owners of non-publicly-traded businesses, but nobody ever cares about them, so whatever, right?

This left open the possibility of instead using the spin-off to prepare for a merger or acquisition of ""Controlled,"" or the subsidiary corporation-- which is the ""reverse"" Morris Trust transaction.  Of course, if you had the right facts and circumstances, you could just screw around with the spin-off to achieve the intended Morris Trust results with the reverse Morris Trust structure.  Luckily, doing so is not that easy, and that's why I am gainfully employed (contrary to popular belief).

As our friends at Yahoo! recently learned, spin-offs are under increased IRS scrutiny because too many corporations have either abused or tried to abuse them.  This is different from tax inversions, where it's less about taking liberties with interpretations and more about optics.

Anyway, I'm here all week and taking requests."

For valuation, I agree with previous comments. The data quality of data providers are not reliable and you should always cross check the numbers with the company's reports. Most of the time I have to paste the data in my model manually and correct the accounting numbers to get economic numbers.

For screening, I use the data of data providers. I accept the data reliability issue to gain the ability to look at ~36.000 companies world wide within a few seconds. If I found an interesting company, I switch to valuation. "

I'm not able to talk about our portfolios at all, but hopefully we'll be able to do an AMA in the future in a compliant fashion. If we do that, it'll be from a team account, but this is just me speaking about my own personal opinions.

I *can* talk about how we work, which is interesting (I think). Basically, everyone on the team is an analyst and does the work of an analyst, even though our formal titles are all Fund Manager and we all manage money. We try to spend ~70% of our time in Excel, modelling stocks. If you come to the desk on a typical day you'll find four of the five investors at our desks with annual reports open.

We actively avoid the too-common fund management approach which goes along the lines of *""I spent five years learning about cash flow statements and balance sheets, but now I'm a PM I should pontificate about interest rates and GDP""*. Instead, we view the PM as an analyst who has a broader experience and an holistic view of all the available investments; while a sector analyst may recommend to buy one auto stock as it is cheap vs another auto stock, we're trying to make the same call but looking at this stock against all our current and potential investments.

The other analyst discipline which we retain but others discard is the writing of research notes. When we say that we expect our new analyst to critique our ideas this is *literally* true. I have two A4-side research notes from the team in my inbox now, and I've spent all of today working on my own. Capturing testable hypotheses about an investment at the time we commit capital is a great way to avoid various psychological biases and to improve our analytical process over time.

* monthly coupon payment $100
* first coupon payment 2/22/2017

* 10 yearly payments of $100 each
* Date of first coupon payment: 1/22/2018

* Payment at year 10 (1/22/2027) $100, just the coupon, and then nothing else since each coupon was payment of principal and *""no interest is accrued though""*

Capital for Company A = $2,275

Klarman doesnt think hed be good enough to do the second style, and he's a fookin legend, so hats off to this guy if he can make this style work over different parts of market cycles and over time.

I've been looking at another company that is a post bankruptcy situation, recently. Kodak. Its an interesting case study in a company thats at the point after having been in bankruptcy, but at this point it has devalued all the old stock, taken on debt/refinanced and become a new company, and now has a bunch of assets, some tangible and some intangible, its got a negative book value, but which has a lot of interesting factors as well and has the potentiality to sell off some of its growth segments and other non performing assets, pay off debt and become a real winner. Its an interesting situation, which kind of juxtaposes a lot of the things were seeing in cases like macys - Kodak being an old brand that had a certain main crown jewel, but which has shifted in to a whole new space and which is becoming a really new company, and really making use of its assets, with a strong case for its being possibly undervalued and currently being seen as a shitty non growth, shrinking, old company (which may be a misunderstanding of its financials)."

Your facts all state factors to include in the top portion of the ROIC (I prefer ROIC over ROC) and the left side of the equation.  Return of capital as a figure demonstrates what does an investor have to pay to achieve those cash flows - all things equal, if I can achieve 30% vs. 20% then I've got something which repays me more for a given dollar of investment (equity or debt).


Build a quick spreadsheet model that just looks at the cash flows you state (i.e., $20M vs. $30M at those rates, then plug in the present values (discount rate won't matter for the purpose of the exercise - just look at the present value), then backsolve to see how much money you'd need to invest to achieve that cash flow.  Sure, your nominal cash return may be larger (using a discount rate of 10% I got $455 in CF and using the ROC of 20% it indicates you'd need to invest $2,275 to achieve that nominal cash return - in the alternative case, to earn $682.5 in cash return, you would have to invest $6,825.... the $4,550 difference in invested capital only generated $227 in incremental earnings over the lifetime of the investment...)"

If they could stop the downward spiral, or even just close everything and sell the inventory for scrap, perhaps something would be left for the shareholders.

I contemplated about buying for a long time. But I didn't have the conviction about when it would stop destroying value. Good for me: it didn't.

In these situations, time is your enemy. A major part of RSH's BV was in inventory that did not age well (tech gadgets). As for Macy's, fashionable stuff does not age well either.

To invest in Macy's you would need to have a good conviction about how and when it will turn around. And it needs strong enough cash flows to keep the company afloat until then. The debt situation is certainly not encouraging.

Liquidation does not seem to be an option as the tangible book value is already nil. Although I really don't know anything about Macy's, I just glanced at the balance sheet for 2 minutes, so there might be off-balance sheet assets, depreciated real estate or something."

2017-01-20 16:38:14,"&gt; you can't intellectually honestly tell someone your 1 year earnings expectation in complete confidence.

Yeah you can. You'll have booked orders and contracts and will know your expected revenue. Sure the shit can hit the fan but this is not unlike planning your personal budget out a year on the assumption that you remain employed.  
  
If anything the greatest criticism of American businesses is that they only take 1 year outlook and do not take a longer 5 year or even a 10 year outlook."
2017-01-20 15:42:35,"I look at how clear their reasoning is. If someone can't explain their idea clearly, they probably don't understand it very well themselves. "
2017-01-20 14:27:45,"Not sure, IDK much about it. Presumably there are distressed investors out there who look at companies like that and maybe they assign a certain probability to each of their becoming solvent again, then make an investment at a low enough price to justify it, and make a win on a large enough % of those investments to get a good return on the portfolio. This is funny though:

2017-01-20 14:13:23,"I didn't say that they don't manage the money and stuff they have, but what I'm saying is that any company cannot accurately know what will happen to their top line in 1-5 years, and the focus on guidance is a bit of a farce.

Yes obviously you must know your liquidity/resources/cash flow etc, but you can't intellectually honestly tell someone your 1 year earnings expectation in complete confidence. Macro economic shocks, currency, what have you will change things rapidly, and if your business is to manage expectations and play penny jar accounting with earnings, you won't actually be steering it where it needs to be in the long run. "
2017-01-20 13:55:56,"That's insane.  
  
When you run a business you have to manage their liquid capital and to do that you have to know how much money you will need and when you will need it. You have to know if you're going to run out of money before it happens so you can secure a new line of credit. If you underspend then you lose money in opportunity cost and interest (or investment gains)."
2017-01-20 13:26:38,"Is anyone else concerned that Uber pays all these enormous costs to work with governments at all levels to bring forth regulations that open up the market for both themselves and their competitors?  If I'm Lyft or Gett or a similar service, I can just piggyback off Uber's money and effort to make my business legal in a given location, then offer the same service with less overhead.  As an amateur observer, I saw that as a rather unique challenge."
2017-01-20 13:23:52,"Funny you mention TGT...I've been thinking about that. Think it's reached a near-term bottom. Have some extensive knowledge of the company too.

2017-01-20 12:21:54,"The author is incorrect on numerous points. The subsidy isn't designed to just keep competition at bay, its designed to kill taxis. Once taxis are gone, the strategy is to settle into a duopoly (a la Intel/AMD) in a geography, become quasi public transportation via UberPool, and use the ubiquity of its driver network/autonomous cars to effect a last mile logistics business cheaper than its competition in multiple verticals. The author lacks vision. While he mentioned all of these pieces he doesn't see how they combine into something truly disruptive.

Autonomous vehicles won't kill Uber's barriers, but will make them vulnerable to a couple companies, namely Amazon. Car companies suck at software in general and I doubt Google's desire (not ability) to build a consumer facing business designed around selling a service. They are really focused on smaller home/lifestyle products and how AI can improve their user experience. Tesla is currently too focused on saving the world to do it (Elon Musk is trying literal moonshots) but with the release of mass market vehicles, it could make a service that allows autonomous car owners to allow their car to make money for them by adding them to the Tesla fleet. We'll see if that happens.

Amazon's current efforts to insource pieces of their logistics network ([last mile delivery](https://logistics.amazon.com/) / [aircraft leasing](http://time.com/4440542/amazon-one-airplane-fedex-ups/)) and their strategy to dogfood their own services as the initial large customer, then sell that service to the public, should scare Uber as well as FedEx and UPS. While the opportunity for Amazon's transportation strategy should play out over the next 10-15 years, While, I'm sure that Uber is aware and preparing for this event (especially in light of its [acquisition of Otto](http://mashable.com/2016/10/25/otto-uber-self-driving-truck/#TnC8JfEgdmqB)), I'm not sure that FedEx and UPS are ready for what will happen."
2017-01-20 12:09:06,"Completely agree that the national or international availability of Uber isn't an advantage. This is a business that will be won or lost city by city. 

I also think autonomous cars have the potential to take away a lot of the barriers to entry. 

If I had a crystal ball, I'd want to know what the No. 2 company will earn in a market. I think there's potential for Uber to price its service so that it earns a good return, and so that a No. 2 loses money. 

That's really all that matters, IMO. "
2017-01-20 11:46:17,"There's got to be some value though even if it is shit. Presumably that value is above 0, and maybe its being discounted excessively now. 

Or maybe it has a value roughly equal to what its trading at. I have no idea, I could be a dog for all you know."

That being said, I'm 100% positive I could learn alot from this approach, and if it helps you get to where you want to be, more power to you."
2017-01-20 11:04:08,"I would say to avoid retail, unless you have some special knowledge of that business environment that gives you conviction that the brick-and-mortar business model is not impaired.  From some annual fund letters that I've read, credit shops are now seeing a ""loan-to-own"" opportunity in the space now, which spells bad news for you as an equity holder.

If you insist on investing in this space, my advice would be to pay particular attention to the value of the real estate that these companies hold.  That could afford you some protection in a downside scenario.  

Overall, I don't feel comfortable with the sector, and I am avoiding it completely despite the discounts available."
2017-01-20 10:52:02,I think in terms of short term quarter to quarter earnings trades it can be very helpful in getting a more accurate estimate of eps vs the consensus. But I can see your point on its limitations
