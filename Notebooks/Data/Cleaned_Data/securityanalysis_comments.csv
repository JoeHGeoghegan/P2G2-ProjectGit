2014-01-30 18:48:51,"From the top of my head, amazons net margin was ridiculously low like 1-5%. When i was studying economics in college, i recall studying markets and information. Amazon gives consumers near perfect information for homogenous goods coupled with increased utility of no travel and convenience. 

Could amazon potentially corner the market and play a strategy of lowest prices period, forcing competitors out of the market, then raise prices with no competition, and once competition comes back in search for profit, reduce prices back to their lowest? Thus big one time short term gains and long instances of near 0% profit. 

Thoughts?"
2014-01-30 18:44:11,"I don't think anyone could be accurate with DCF models, though they give you the illusion of precision. The inputs are very subjective, so going through the whole exercise is likely pointless. I like Buffett's thoughts on analysis: focus on qualitative aspects of the company, then get an idea of owner's earnings under normal business conditions."
2014-01-30 18:28:38,"Banks and insurers are opposite in a sense.

In a bank, you know what your liabilities are, but you don't know what your assets are worth. If the people you lent to can't repay the loans you have, then the assets aren't any good.

In an insurer, you can have a decent idea on your assets, but you don't know what your liabilities are exactly, because they're composed of reserves that haven't paid out.

Genworth and Symetra seem to be involved in life insurance and mortgage insurance (Genworth specifically).

As you may have seen with insurers, they tend to blow up. AIG, Tower Group, Meadowbrook (There are some pockets of good here... just poor influence), MBIA, Conseco, etc. are all recent examples, but it's happened many times before them all too. 

Instead of focusing on making a return, let's think about how to blow up an insurer:

1. Underprice your products - if you sell below cost, even Buffett's ability to generate returns won't be helpful. Tower group is a good example.

2. Expose yourself to significant man made disasters (especially when they're not well understood) - Asbestos, terrorism, financial market insurance, etc. If you write insurance on mortgages (this is typically for people who can't pay 20% down for a home), and home prices fall enough, what do you do? If you're fannie and freddie, you don't slack off on credit guidelines, and you do everything possible to avoid default. If you insure mortgages and they were slacking off, then when home prices fall, your insurers will be subject to them. These are all ""man made"" because it wasn't the result of something more natural like a hurricane. In some cases, I will invest in a financial insurers, but not frequently.

3. Make bad investments - if you invest your premiums horribly, then that can ruin the firm.

That's just a list of 3 things that came to my mind right away, but insurance is filled with 50 more things to do. It's an extremely sensitive business in my opinion and can be ruined with a bad CEO. For example, compare it to Coca Cola. Even if the CEO of Coca Cola does something dumb, the business is likely to print billions of dollars in profit. If you get an idiot at a bank, well, you've already seen this one... their shareholders go to 0. If you get an idiot at an insurer, the outcome isn't *too* different.

I'm happy to invest in insurers, but there are a lot of risks that need to be looked at to understand it well. I hope I don't come off as someone who says to avoid insurance... I just recommend caution. When the Japanese earthquake/tsunami struck, I was actively making many purchases, and was able to buy into a wonderful insurer run by a CEO who truly ""gets it."" It's a firm where maximizing shareholder value is actually what they do and not just what they say. Long story short, it's a really interesting industry to study, but just be cautious about what type of business you're purchasing.

If you ever want some resources to learn more about them, let me know."

You will never be able to accurately find the intrinsic value of a going concern company because of time and risk.

2014-01-30 17:10:48,"You seem to have most of the DCF pro's and con's down, which is very interesting.

My background as an econometrician would advise you to never rely totally on one method, especially not a financial model. These models rely on very strict assumptions which will not hold up in real life.

Therefore, the model must be taken as a rough guide, and thought/critique must be added to the specific situation before you come to a conclusion.

You've listed the major faults with the DCF above. It doesn't need to be 'the best we have', in fact that you can outline it's problems so clearly is a very good thing. If you were to use it asses the difficulties that you have outlined and you have a very powerful tool."

2014-01-30 16:42:32,"Take the annual report of Microsoft and rebuild the earnings. It has cash cow businesses like office and windows to the unprofitable search and mobile business.

Sort all business from stable to unstable. And begin with the most stable.
Office produces constantly growing earnings so you can value it via Terminal Value: TV = earnings * 1 / (R - G) ; R is rent, which is always 15% or higher, my personal investment hurdle. G is growth, which is the average, median, minimum growth over the last 5-10 years. 
Sum TV of the business less Liabilities together till you get market cap. Than you have an idea whats free.

What are the model assumptions: 

TV and Growth: TV is highly unstable, because it discounts cash flows from infinity. Therefore do not play around with R and use high R, which is your PERSONAL interest rate before you make an investment (no risk adjustment here, adjustments should be in the earnings imho). You can play around with G. This helps to identify what growth the market or you should demand before making an investment. Compare G with your common sense and the quality of business - you need to understanding the economics of that business!

Order of the business stability: This is very subjective. Its easier to order business A before B before C, than to quantify the quality. You should change the order and see whats happening.

Try to kill the company: Play around with the G and TV to kill the company. Get a sense for things that can kill your thesis.

Do not use it to value, but to test your assumptions on the business. Play around! Get a feeling what matters? What has to happen before a total loss of capital? What is already priced in? What is the upside/downside? How likely is it? 

I invest when my upside is substanitally higher than my downside. Thats all. Simple but not easy."

"
2014-01-30 16:01:04,"Not?

You're discounting things from the future.  Almost by definition, future things are unknowable now.  You can find unknowable things that tend to realize consistent values .. like a money market fund, but you know the deal there.

In my worthless opinion, the beauty of a DCF is not in its accuracy but in its flexibility.  You can really assign a value to anything.  The process of assigning that value (if you don't have an ulterior motive) should at least make you very aware of what you require in the future for your valuation to hold."
2014-01-30 15:50:24,"I agree with Prof. Greenwald's approach. I've developed my own principles which share the same philosophy, and is applicable to all companies. The unpopular part is that it involves more qualitative measures than we're used to.   
  
I think your approach in rebuilding the earnings statement is brilliant. I too share the sentiment that the market is not a good indicator (below average) of value in the short term. It acts more like a bottom up mechanism than a top down one if you ask me.   
  
I'm open to hearing more suggestions from you. Maybe more specific :)"

2014-01-30 15:07:35,"Without any dought, the current enterprise value is the sum of all discounted cash flows in the future.
""the real flaw of the DCF model is the assumption"": I agree. DCF has correct math but in practice flawd assumptions.
Prof. Greenwald of Columbia uses an approach based on the reliablity of the companies assets (incl. non accountable assets like brands &amp; competitive advatages). http://www.scribd.com/doc/15987706/Greenwald-Earnings-Power-Value-EPV-lecture-slides

I use a similar approach and try to rebuild a company earnings statement to see which business part I get for free. I like free parts which have high upside but have very unreliable cash flows (new product launch, restructuring). The markets tend to be very bad in assessing the probabilities and sucess/fail payouts. 
This approach works similar with business parts which drag the performance of the overall company. The market discount might be higher than negative value of the business part (liquidation value of that part).

Last but not least, valuation is never precise. If you have a single number with decimal places, its very likely wrong. I have always value ranges!

I believe they can help determine a relative value range, but it won't accurately predict a price or specific value by any stretch. It's just a tool to support a hypothesis on a company's value.

In practice, most people use multiples because they are quicker and the market's opinion of value matters more than your opinion of value.

2014-01-30 12:34:17,"&lt;this is something I wrote awhile back. Would appreciate your thoughts. please try to be as detailed as possible in your analysis; I would be eternally grateful if nobody pointed out a fault for the sake of pointing it out.&gt;

For the benefit of those not in the know, the DCF method is the most important formula known to the modern investing world in the investment decision. It involves extrapolating the future earnings of the business from its current performance, hence deriving the value of the company, or the maximum one would pay to buy its shares. The way it works is like by reverse-engineering this straightforward formula:

e/p = r

Where p is the price it’s worth, r is the rate of return and e are its earnings. Let’s say you have a dishwasher which costs you $100. If you buy the dishwasher and it saves you an hour a day washing dishes, you could theoretically turn around and invest that hour into something productive, like freelance programming or article writing. If you can get $10 per hour from that side activity which you would have otherwise spent washing dishes, you can say that you’ve earned a 10% return per day on your initial investment.

e/r = p

The way DCF works is it reverse-engineers the formula (as above) to try and predict what the future price of the company is worth. Let’s say that by looking at the past earnings of the last 10 years, one forecasts it will reliably carry on producing stable cash flows for the next 10 years, thus giving us the ‘e’. Then, by accounting for certain key risks factors, one predicts the expected rate of return, thus giving us the ’r’. By dividing the two (of course it’s not that simple, I’m just summarizing it), you can forecast a future ‘p’ of the company, and by dividing ‘p’ by the number of shares you can find out the maximum price you’d be willing to pay for each share.

On paper, this seems like a brilliant way to predict the correct share price to buy a share at. However, this formula has a number of issues. Firstly, it is far too simplistic to assume with confidence that a company’s earnings will remain stable for an indefinite amount of time. Too many companies, even untouchable juggernauts the likes of Microsoft, Washington Post and Lehman Brothers, have demonstrated that even the safest of havens can be upset by new developments. Surely there are some whose cash flows have endured, such as the ever recognisable Coca-Cola and insurance giant Geico, but statistically speaking no large company can be considered ‘assuredly safe’ from the ravages of time.

Secondly, the employ of determining ‘e’ is fraught with perils and uncertainties. Let me give you the most drastic example, the valuing of what’s known as real options. Real options represent the potential earnings a company might derive from some asset it currently holds but does not yield positive cash flows from. For instance, let’s say JCP is currently having negative cash flows, but owns a piece of empty land next to it. In arriving at future earnings, you can’t say that the land is completely stagnant because it might be utilized in the future, for example by building an extension to the shopping mall or a new hotel. The valuing of real options employs the Black-Scholes model used to value options and warrants to extrapolate the future earnings of an unused piece of land. Keep in mind that the land is not being used at all, with no future plans to use it; and we are assuming that a model used to value static systems like options can be extrapolated to a dynamic situation like an unused piece of land. A flood could come tomorrow and render it forever condemned for commercial purposes. Even so, the use of real options in valuing a piece of unused property can sometimes exceed the current value of the said property itself! Let’s just put it this way, if I were a billionaire and you presented me with a price for JCP, I would definitely want to know whether you included real options in your valuation.

Lastly, the derivation of future ‘r’ is also no small task. The current method extrapolates the current debt and equity values to provide an appropriate risk profile to determine a reliable rate of return into the future, however what’s to say that the current risks will remain the same 20 years into the future? Look at the history of any newspaper company and you’ll realize how fragile even the largest companies can be. The remedy for that is to provide a range of different ‘r’s to accommodate the possibility of things going awry, however if your company goes bankrupt or loses half its earnings potential, a range isn’t going to be very helpful for your investment.

However, I’m not discounting the DCF method entirely. I’m not trying to villainize it as an impractical formula which has lost its utility in the modern world. I’m simply saying that, given its widespread acceptance and the trust millions of investors place in it, perhaps it deserves a second look. The fact that Warren Buffett did not use it in his younger days, (Alice Schroeder uses the phrase ""decades and decades"") lends credence to the possibility that it may not be all that it appears to be. As someone who has done numerous DCF calculations in the past, I have my doubts on its reliability, especially on small and medium sized companies.

The DCF method is far from being the only culprit in the ‘its-not-perfect-but-its-the-best-we-have’ camp which is unquestionably relied on in the broad finance industry. With a disposable amount of capital this might not be such a big deal, but when the livelihoods of families and entire economies around the world at stake, maybe we should give it a closer look.

If there are high ROI investment opportunities  available to the company (i.e. unavailable to you as an individual investor) that earn more than the company's cost of capital, you want the company to put it back into work. If you don't think there are or you don't trust management to execute on them, you'll want the money back. This is why you see high profile activist investors frequently agitating the Board to return cash to shareholders and why dividend and buybacks are generally looked upon as shareholder-friendly moves.

A lot of the time management of mature companies will hoard cash and look for ways to spend it (acquisitions, new products, developing things, etc.) as a way of justifying their paycheck and job title. Sometimes these are good investments, many times they're not.

apple posted a great link that pretty much covers it. A share repurchase is essentially the company investing its cash in itself. It's essentially the company saying it will earn an ROI higher than its cost of capital by investing in the company, as if it were making any other kind of investment.

Before sending cash back to investors, Baupost nearly passed the $30 billion AUM mark this year, compared to just $27 million in 1982, and during that time Klarman has always made a point of focusing on long-term value creation. Sometimes that means holding onto cash so that he could seize opportunities as they arose.

“To assume the investment opportunity sets that are available to you today are as good (or better) than those that will present themselves next week, next month, next quarter is naive and you need to have cash to take advantage of those new investment opportunity sets,” said Klarman, according to Raymond James chief investment strategist Jeffrey D. Saut, who attended Klarman’s talk at the Grant’s Investment Conference.

So having cash on hand was not, by itself, a major problem. But Baupost had $14 billion in cash as of late October 2013, nearly half of its total portfolio, and Klarman didn’t expect to find enough interesting investment opportunities to put that money to work. "

2014-01-27 10:45:51,"The rule of thumb is to use all of the explicit cash flows and then use a terminal value.

If it is a company that you believe will have a perpetual existence (an assumption that is made in pretty much every case except for liquidations or some special situations), you should also include a terminal value beyond the explicit forecast period.  So if you explicitly forecast 10 years of cash flows, you should then have a terminal value (using a growing perpetuity formula) in the final period and then discount that back to the present as well.  Sometimes you will also see people use an ""exit multiple"" of EBITDA, earnings, or cash flow instead of a growing perpetuity, but I think that is more common in private market valuation.  Add all of the cash flows up and that is the total value you estimated for your security.

You should also be sure that you are discounting the proper cash flow claims though.  For instance, if you are trying to value the equity of a company you need to make sure that you are using 

* 1) the appropriate discount rate for equity (not the firm), and 
* 2) the appropriate cash flows for equity (after subtracting interest payments, preferred dividends, and any other claims that have higher priority than equity)

2014-01-26 22:23:52,"...If you discount for long enough the incremental value of the cash flow should become fairly meaningless. 
For example, discounting at 10% (.9^15 = .205), cash flow 15 years from now is worth 1/5 of what cash flow is worth now...

More telling might be a terminal value calculation. A business generating $1 infinitely at a 10% discount rate should be worth $10 right?(terminal value of infinite geometric series), but we can see that the cash 15 years from now is worth $0.2...so Y15 is only 2% of the whole intrinsic value calculation...in fact Y10 is only worth 3.4% of the whole intrinsic value and 

.9^10 + .9^11 + .9^12 + .9^13 + .9^14 + .9^15( years 10 through 15) is just worth 16% of the total value of the company....so you never have to draw the line, MOST of the value of a company in the present comes from value IN the 1st 10 years

To prove my point, 1 + .9^1 + .9^2 + .9^3 + .9^4 (the first 5 years)=40% OF THE COMPANY!

The hardest part of discounted cash flow isn't actually the # of years(always discount infinitely forwards if the business is a going concern), it's projecting the cash flows that far out...how are you supposed to predict the future cash flows in year 15? THAT's the challenge.

Goodluck!"

2014-01-25 14:59:40,"One thing you glossed over which is extremely important is how to think about the discount rate.

Discount rate is essentially the investor's opportunity cost of capital. Let's say there's another orange tree with 2 harvests left, each $20, on sale for $33.80. Now, if you use the formulas you talked about, this comes out to an annual return (IRR) of 12%.

This means that in our investment universe (2 investments, lemon tree and orange tree), the opportunity cost of capital is 12%. If we buy the lemon tree, we're leaving a guaranteed return of 12% on the table.

Now, in this case we'd use 12% as our discount rate. After calculating the PV of all future cash flows at 12%, what is this tree worth to me? If it's below the asking price, it's a good deal. If it's above, then it is not for *me and my investment requirements*.

It can also be a measure of risk. I'm an investor whose required return for purchasing sapling lemon trees is 15%. There's more risk in buying saplings. You have to feed them, nurture them until they become trees that yield fruit. Storms or bugs could kill them. My required return for buying adult trees is 8%. Why? They're already bearing fruit, I can predict my cash flows with more certainty. Thus, I require a lower IRR on my investment."

But tires, themselves have little differentiation and could be considered almost commodities themselves.  Whereas, cars have quite a bit of differentiation and name-brand recognition, a moat, if you will.  

The tire industry has been consolidating in recent history and I think it will eventually turn into an oligopoly type business, in which business and multiples would increase.  Could be a good place to park some money for the long haul.  Especially as it appears that it's one of the few ""cheap"" industries left."

2014-01-24 09:23:01,"The rubber and tire industry is low multiple because it has low margins, high capital intensity, unions, pensions and a lot of commodity risk.  Frankly, I don't think it's a really attractive industry.  Look at Cooper Tires.  They had a buyout offer on the table from Apollo Tyres from India (an LBO by Apollo Group) and the unions in the US and China stuck a knife through it.  Enter lawyers and advisors -&gt; fees and distractions.

Yes, tires aren't going anywhere soon, but these companies have a lot of baggage and low margins.  They're just not all that attractive when compared to other industries."
2014-01-24 09:11:13,"Rubber and tires would probably have a fairly low debt actually. 
Taken off Investopedia...""Enterprise value is calculated as market cap plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents"". So a low ratio isn't necessarily bad, its just saying how much you would pay for a company per its earnings before tax. 

Since the EV/EBIT ratio is so low, either the ev is low or the EBIT is high. Since rubber is a commidity, I would imagine most companies use their cash to hedge the cost. Since you subtract cash from EV, that would lower the multiple. I would also imagine that the demand for tires is relatively stable, so there isn't as much need to use leverage to build a new plant, as you might for a car/airplane company. Finally, if the revenue is relatively stable, then it make sense to have a lower EV/EBIT since you know that there aren't going to be any real increases in demand. You wouldn't want to pay 20 times the earnings if the compay's revenues are going to remain the same year over year versus a finance company that could potentially have a much higher upside

BUT, I also read a very interesting article about China's ghost cities. The govt is building them with the intention of migrating their rural population en masse to city life. Then, they're going to industrialize agriculture like the US--boom, DE wins.

It's not the poor countries that are fueling DEs growth--it's the BRIC. They will certainly use seeds, but these are large players with large capital resources, and potentially government encouragement in the biggest market (China), and they will certainly be buying shit tons of tractors.

I think I'm right that the seeds will impact the industry, especially in poorer places, but I'm beginning to think that this won't translate to John Deeres suffering. They don't depend on those countries, nor does their growth plan involve them. Their growth plan is BRIC. China is obv the strongest argument--China's govt isn't like the USA govt..they say jump, you say how high? If they want to urbanize their population, and industrialize their agriculture, it will happen. And Deere will have a market 4x the size of the US to expand into. A market that also had a much higher population density than the US, and thus a greater need for improved yield

If they can't beat the market over a long period of time of let's say 20+ years, that's an F. Why would anybody invest with you rather than an index if you can't do that even before fees? Neither of those two have done that.

If you can beat the index by a small margin, then you might be the real deal. 

If you can beat it by a wide margin, then you are a true value investor.

I find it hard to analyze this kind of stuff though. Your approach of looking at the NAV of the ships is absolutely correct when cash flows are this unpredictable. But there is debt, so a large part of your analysis should be the probability of a default and the aftemath for shareholders. You've obviously looked at that, but I'm not convinced there is an adequate margin of safety like there was for Wabash National. So I like the analysis but I don't agree with the conclusion."
2017-03-16 15:40:46,"This question isn't so bad :p. If you look at the 8-K they filed on March 30 2016 you'll see the following:

11.2 (m) Negative covenants: Acquisition of capital assets. 

None of the Borrower or the Guarantors shall **acquire any capital assets (including any vessel other than a Ship) by purchase, charter or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders**, provided that for the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Clause 11.2(m) shall prevent or be deemed to prevent capital improvements being made to a Ship.

So you can see that they can acquire so long as they are given permission by the Lenders. In this case, I imagine the Lenders gave them the go ahead to possibly acquire a vessel with the cash proceeds they received. Hope this answers your question!

2017-03-16 12:33:36,"The percentage of sales coming from mobile phones is up dramatically over the last half dozen years.  If it weren't for phones, revenue declines would have been much steeper.  Also, half of revenues come from selling Apple, Samsung, HP, Sony and LG products, which I assume are basically phones, computers and TVs, the bulk of which are still sold in person.

I also think current management has done a really good job.  If you go back 5 years or so, BBY had way too many stores and a bloated cost structure.  Management has done a lot to streamline the operations.  In my view, you have to treat the recent improvements in margins as one time operational improvements rather than a change in the underlying trend. "

I would suggest that the downward path will continue to be slow but inexorable.  I will acknowledge though that their business has held up better than I would have expected.  In part, I think it is due to the factor you state - a big chuck of their sales is for big ticket items that customers wish to buy in person.  Another reason is that they have changed their business model somewhat  - a big part of their business is now selling mobile phones which in general still take place in person."

2017-03-16 07:37:13,[deleted]
2017-03-16 07:13:44,"Depends

3 ways this goes

**Option 1:**

There's a reserve, something along the lines of *Allowance for Bad Debt* / *Bad Debt Allowance*, in which case:

* Decrease Bad Debt Allowance (Balance Sheet)
* Decrease Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)

Done, no changes to the Income Statement'
No change to Cash

**Option 2:**

NO reserve.

* Decrease Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)
* Make an entry in the Income Statement for Bad Debt

Income decreases by $50M, if Income before this was &gt;$50M then yes the effect to Net income would be $25M (assuming 50% tax rate). I guess as a ripple effect of the tax write off there will be a lesser Cash outflow.

**Option 3:**  There's a reserve in place which is less than $50M so it's a mix of 1 and 2 above.

NOTE: If the company doesn't have an *Allowance for Bad Debt* under the assumption that the business doesn't warrant one (strange that the auditors would allow this), after this event the auditors would no longer allow it and going forward there would be *Allowance for Bad Debt* / *Bad Debt Allowance*."

I just like to ramble off at times.

2017-03-15 19:44:00,Typically the five year summary - obviously only a high level overview. Often reading about the company in the first place is the result of noticing something in the numbers and wanting to look further.
2017-03-15 19:23:33,Agreed. X = Stage in the fabrication / value chain
2017-03-15 19:22:28,"I've been hearing a lot from this kind of investor lately. Intense focus on finding the best business models and increasingly less focus on valuation. Certainly seems like a more comfortable strategy to adopt when many of us cite ""selling too soon"" as the most frequent mistake we've made since the financial crisis. "
2017-03-15 19:02:03,"Look here is the problem. Those are all really valid things, but how do you quantify that? How can we quantify that for the company? How much will that impact, what if the volume of goods isn't as much as the change in value? That's like a journey down the rabbit hole of infinity of possibilites. The goal here is to value the single company and see if this is a good investment, and I don't think that's something that you can honestly create real outcomes to forecast onto price. These things will likely effect most of everything pretty uniformly, and thus I feel like it's not worth the rabbit hole.

Buffett notoriously DOESN'T macro forecast, nor does Marks, and Dalio is in a slightly different game in my opinion. This is security analysis, and you're describing trade and economic analysis. Are these the most relevant factors that will drive the valuation? Or is the claims on ships vs NAV the most relevant factors to valuation. I'm going to go with the latter, and even with significant volatility in trade scenarios, the latter is likely to still be within a band of values, especially considering that ships have scrap value at some point. It's the forest for the trees, what actually matters versus what we could intellectualize for years. My opinion, and I can be wrong so YMMV. "

2017-03-15 17:14:27,"Youre right. it's forecasting. But if trade barriers continue to be put up, especially by the largest consumer economy in the world, it will have a strong effect on the shipping industry.

Scared of the shift? Not so much. But I'm not ignorant to history and markers that predate certain events that have a drastic effect on economic factors. Nothing I said in there was a lie...

If Buffett/Marks/Dalio measure certain economic factors to gauge the current state of the market, why can't someone apply historical instances to further map the current conditions?"

2017-03-15 15:12:08,"Can you shine some light on this?

From their last 10-Q, filed November 9 of last year:

&gt;The First Lien Facility contains financial covenants requiring Eagle Shipping, among other things, to ensure that the aggregate market value of
the vessels in the Company’s fleet (plus the value of certain additional collateral) at all times on or after July 1, 2017 does not fall below 100% in the
third and fourth quarters of 2017, 110% in 2018 and 120% in 2019 of the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (subject to certain adjustments)
under the First Lien Facility and maintain minimum liquidity of not less than the greater of (i) $8,140,000 and (ii) $185,000 per vessel in the Company’s
fleet. In addition, the First Lien Facility also imposes operating restrictions on Eagle Shipping including limiting Eagle Shipping’s ability to, among
other things: pay dividends; incur additional indebtedness; create liens on assets; **acquire and sell capital assets (including vessels)**; and merge or
consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all of Eagle Shipping’s assets to, another person.

Which seems inconsistent with their [current report](http://www.eagleships.com/sec-filing-display/?url=http%3A%2F%2Firxml.corporate-ir.net%2Ffilings%2Ftext.data%3Fid%3D11277829%26vid%3DaHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExMjc3ODI5JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3%26compId%3D189576) (among others) filed a month later on December 13, which states:

&gt;On December 13, 2016, Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (the “Company,” “Eagle Bulk,” “we,” “our” or similar terms), a Republic of the Marshall Islands corporation, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investors in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) approximately 22.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at an initial purchase price of $4.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $100.0 million. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for the **acquisition of dry bulk tonnage** and general corporate purposes.

Surely I'm missing something huge. Thoughts? I haven't gone through everything.


Edit: you also need to look careful at how the debt is structured. You may want to model debt repayments vs cash flows in excel to get a good grasp of how it will play out. I think you're being optimistic in your assessment of the debt and the fate of common stockholders when they run into trouble again.

2017-03-15 14:00:07,"2 big questions:

1. it looks like they already defaulted on their debt, which is leading to the cash sweep. The debt is due in 2019 and there is no way they are going to generate $250mn in cash to pay off the whole principal, so in that case what happens? Do they refinance?

2: 

&gt;In a worst case scenario if vessels are written down to 40 % - 50 % of their book value and shares are increased by 80 % - 100 % over the next 6 – 18 months, NAV per share can range from $ 3.24 - $ 5.46 per share which results in a – 41 % to – 1 % downside.

What are you assuming is the price for the dilution? I would assume if they are using PIPEs then either the price is lower than market, or early investors are getting warrants of some kind?

The last question I have is on liquidity but is more of an afterthought. You can't really pitch this to a fund because it looks like 66,000 shares have traded so far today, and only 100,000 yesterday (x$5/share = $500,000 in dollar value/day). Would be impossible for a fund to get in and out of, and would drastically destroy downside calculations due to difficulty in trading at the time you'd actually need the liquidity."

2017-03-15 13:02:31,"Sorry its taken me so long to respond. I had meant to since you specifically referenced me. I didn't have time to look at the whole write-up for you but I did check out your tear sheet and write some notes. By the way, you have a very familiar looking format. 

Odds are you will only get a PM to, at most, read your tear sheet so extra attention should be paid to it. There may be some things that I point you that are better elaborated on in your appendix pages, but the point is that not everyone will read that part. 

First thing is that at the top of your page I would rather see a model of historical/projected financials rather than a 12 month price performance chart. 

Under thesis point 1, you state that ""TDOC is nothing more than a call center operator with little to-no proprietary technology"" and ""unachievable growth projections"". This makes up the bulk of your variant opinion and is very important, but you need to explain the WHY behind these points and how they are detrimental to future operating results. 

Under point 3, you reference lack of profitability but this is kinda meaningless without context, which is why I suggested adding a brief historical model somewhere on the front page. You should also maybe include some language as to WHY adjusted EBITDA is slated to become profitable/why you disagree. 

Under point 4, you reference a $29bn TAM that is barely penetrated, but this is an example of something that should be quantified for the reader. Also, ""while there is no denying the market for broad based telehealth adoption is large"" is 100% fluff material and doesn't belong on the tear sheet. Every sentence should be a fact or something that supports a view of yours. 

I disagree with including point 5 on your tear sheet. As others have pointed out, it is probably anecdotal evidence at best and doesn't really add anything to your variant opinion. Lots of people hate lots of companies, and I can probably find negative reviews out there easily. Over the past 6 years, EA's stock has grown 30% annualized despite being named one of the worst companies in America and I could blindly throw a rock in any direction and find a negative review of their company. 

The bit about the credit agreement is super interesting here. I think it is important enough to warrant a sport as a full investment thesis point. 

Your REAL catalyst for this thesis is Q4 2017 earnings. You should make that your big, exclusive point under your catalyst section. 

Everything else looks fine to me. The only other bit I might include is that I think your thesis is strong enough, and the operating model deterioration will be big enough to yield an attractive valuation without implying a multiple re-rate. That is just something about me, I don't like to assume re-rates in my theses. 

But overall I think this is pretty good. I have glanced through the remainder of the pages and they look strong. Wish I could comment more on the validity of your work, but what I hope to communicate here is how to better format/present your work to an audience. "

2017-03-15 11:47:30,"I like it.

Reminds me that I need to take a deeper look into on going debt and the associated parameters with my own DD's.

One thing I'm finding concerning for the world economy, and the relative industries that rely on it, is the ever more rising of 'populism', as the socio-economists are calling it. We called it 'patriotism' back in the day. Nationalism, secularism... the list goes on. In small quantities it's not much to worry about, but when entire countries are doing it... Well... it literally predates every major conflict we've seen in the past... forever.

Historically, it seems to mirror some sort of domino effect. The splitting of the Roman Empire led to the wars/skirmishes during the 16th and 17th century in Europe, eventually leading to major conflicts like the French and American revolutions. The splitting of social/religious/political/economic ideas in America that led to the Civil war. WW1, WW2... The list goes on. When people start to close off their ideologies, war seems to be the only route in which the close-mindedness is alleviated.

I don't know if we'll have another world war. Nukes are a scary thing, and no world leader wants to be that guy. I don't think we'll see another civil war in America... But I do know we've seen this sort of collective behavior before. 

Like Nietzsche said... 
'Insanity in individuals is somewhat rare. But in groups, parties, nations, and epochs, it is the rule.'

Can I ask a favor? Ive got a DD I did on AOBC... There's a post somewhere around here with links to my (newborn) blog. I'm fairly new to Reddit so I'm not too well versed on the ins and outs of proper link posting.. If you could be so kind to check it out and give me your two cents, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Happy investing.

2017-03-15 08:33:09,"as you've now seen, hedge funds are not only behind the eight ball in terms of fees (never make up the difference to the market), but also in ongoing regulatory requirements, audit, and general management expenses (i have friends who run them;  some have said to do things right requires at least $200k a year -- this particular friend managed ~3B).  
  
the managed account route is the smartest way to organize IF you feel the need to build the existing investment business.  by that i mean you need and want to attract more assets in a relatively short period of time.  IF all you care about is a track record, then you really don't need to bother with this.  setup a basic llc and begin executing.  depending on what state you live in, most have very friendly exemptions from state regulatory registration for friends and family (i know, i happen to live in one that doesn't).

Although I have a bluetooth keyboard and have used it to take extensive notes in the MS Word app, if I'm going to be taking a lot of notes, I'll just use my laptop for that purpose.  My office has a two screen setup with my laptop serving as one screen and another screen set up next to it.  I can have the SEC filing next to a word document or an excel file so I can see both simultaneously.  My typical habit when learning about a company is to download the 10-K on my iPad, go to a coffee shop for a couple of hours to read the business description and MD&amp;A, and then return to my office when I get to the financials and footnotes so I can open excel and do more analytical work.

If I can't do the math in the my head, or with some simple multiplication/division, I'm not wasting my time on it.

Monkeys are at best 50/50 when we try and guess the future. Go look at all those EPS estimates that the big guys put out every year. How often are they right? Afterall, they are using DCF's and CAPM's with other little add-ons to get there... Notice how they change qtr to qtr and year to year...

2018-04-01 00:58:42,"You wouldn't add book value to EBITDA ever.

Book value in a tech company is essentially useless because their intangible assets pretty much won't ever equal book value, nor will any of their tangible assets which are directly tied to the value of the intangibles.

However, in a pure valuation sense, you could do it on an EBITDA multiple (compared to your comps), but you wouldn't add it to the book value because an EBITDA multiple would encompass the book value of the assets. Similarly, were you to do a DCF, this would already be inclusive of the book value of the assets."
2018-04-01 00:56:51,"A company with a decreasing book is good most of the time. That means the company is earning a higher return on equity which benefits the investor. In MSFT's case, they have been repurchasing shares heavily which is good.

"
2018-04-01 00:36:17,"Uh, yeah... I guess that is true to a certain extent.  But as you probably know, a huge number of market participants, from analysts to investors, attempt to divine what the ""true value"" of a company is that they might determine if it is over or under priced and, as the case may be, and go long or short.  All of this under the assumption that eventually the market achieves rationality in valuing a company.  As Buffett/Graham put it (paraphrasing here), ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine (price action/speculation), but in the long run, it is a weighing machine (intrinsic value).""

So saying, ""it's all supply and demand"" doesn't really address my original question, nor does it add meaningfully to this conversation."
2018-04-01 00:30:44,"My calc was ([Total Assets $241.086B] - [Intangibles $45.228B] - [Liabilities $168.692B] = [Book Value $27.166B]).  As others are pointing out though, intangibles are much more ""tangible"" (for lack of a better phrase) for software makers than for, say, manufacturer's.  So maybe it makes sense to deduct goodwill, but not some other intangibles like IP.  The LinkedIn acquisition is a major driver of the decline in book value as I have calculated it as you can be sure there was a HUGE amount of goodwill built into that acquisition price.  I actually think MSFT has a great business, but I, like you, feel like it is excessively overpriced and am just trying to understand why."
2018-03-31 22:05:12,"What's your calculation for book value?  I'm getting $78B currently (Total assets - Total Liabilities).
  
IMO some of the excess pricing in the market for MSFT can be attributed to a number of things, such as potential from revenue growth in the social media space from the acquisition of LinkedIn, which closed at the end of 2016.   Also the market has added premium to all companies getting into the cloud and SaaS (which Microsoft has been doing).  The market also likes how CEO Nadella has been positioning the company strategically since he took over.
  
Microsoft goofed on the Phone business with the Nokia acquisition; however that event did not tank the stock.  
  
But I agree with you MSFT appears excessively priced.  The market may perceive a few other growth factors I haven't listed, yet."

This tool would definitely help with this research.

Would be awesome if you could somehow incorporate that (although i have no idea how). Like cheech401 said, the current daily rate and the historical yields would also be very  helpful. and an updated list of recent sales of ships and what price anad age they were.

2018-01-30 19:23:25,"A long only fund isn't able to charge 2% &amp; 20%. But many long only funds hold a good amount of cash (let's say ~20% cash).

This is the same exposure level as a long/short fund that is 100% long, 20% short. Both have 80% exposure. In fact, I'd argue that many long/short funds have more net long exposure than the average long only fund.

The only difference is the hedge fund is earning 2 &amp; 20, the long only isn't. 

The 20% incentive fee was designed for market neutral funds who were expected to have close to 0% exposure. This is why they were called ""hedge funds"" back in the 50s: they were actually hedged. Any profits were considered independent of market movement, and therefore they earned 20% of anything made.

In today's version of the hedge fund structure, my opinion is the fund should clear the hurdle of the investor's opportunity cost (let's say the S&amp;P 500 which earns 6% per year on avg, or 6% pro-rated for the fund's net exposure) before they can earn an incentive fee.

That's all I'm saying. 

If a fund has 20 or 30% net exposure, sure, they deserve a 20% incentive fee. That fund has built out a real short book and they should be earning 20% incentive fee because their exposure is so low.

There are a lot of hedge funds that masquerade as long/short funds - but operate as glorified long books with little to no hedging, yet they earn the big money for their services (2 &amp; 20%)."

And it's US's turn. After the collapse of the dot com bubble. Greespan has begun to supply more money than it's needed. which made a housing bubble and subprime crisis. and then Bernanke did it again to escape from subprime crisis. a systemic risk. it's worse than the aftermath of the dotcom bubble. there was no sufficient spare to lower interest rates. thus they brought unconventional monetary policy called QE. it's the history of past two decades. why did they do that? because they had too much fear to be same with japan. so they did opposite of japan. supplied too much money. one thing different than japan is that US has been exported these aftermath to overseas. i bet Global economy will suffer something seriously bad when interest rates goes back to normal level."

2018-01-30 19:10:55,"I’m quite familiar with how hedge funds work. 

I still don’t understand you’re original point. If you run &lt;100% net exposure (on down to 0%), then charging 20% on profits make sense by the logic I laid out above. If you just use shorts to lever but maintain 100% net exposure, you shouldn’t clip 2 and 20 - are there a lot of funds that run 130/30 or 120/20 with 2 and 20 fee structures with no hurdles? I have not seen it. 


Also, 2 and 20 (with a big hurdle) is not 2 and 20 and introducing shorts to your portfolio so that you can charge “2 and 20” (but with a big hurdle) is not a free lunch.

"
2018-01-30 18:51:57,"Some funds do have &lt;100% exposure. But they are still earning 20% on that net exposure. 

True market neutral funds were what people had in mind when the hedge fund structure of a 20% incentive fee was designed. Non market-neutral funds should be using a hurdle rate to approximate beating their benchmark before earning an incentive fee.

Separately, many funds take the proceeds of their 30% short exposure, and then lever up to go 130% long (keeping their net exposure at 100%). That's the idea behind the ever popular 130/30 hedge fund. Or 120/20 hedge fund."

People say this all the time but it makes no sense. If you are trying to generate alpha with shorts with no hedging (why???), yes, I guess. But otherwise, “timing” works exactly the same for longs and shorts (when compared to an index).

Your comment about the housing market shorts is true because of the nature of the specific derivative instruments they used (because they were liquid) to gain short exposure."
2018-01-30 17:45:21,"we are basically in the reverse 1950s.

Rates held low artificially to control war debt did not reflect the real rate which should be high due to low supply of capital and high demand for capital. Which was why asset prices such as stocks and houses were so cheap back then.

Now we are in the reverse, we have tons of capital, yet little demand for capital. Companies are rushing to hand that capital back and not really investing in anything. Unless we have a massive crisis (hyperinflation/deflationary shock) which wipes out capital or some suddenly massive capital intensive technological frontier coming (which AI isn't, if anything it will be capital light due to 0 marginal costs), then we are going to be in this environment for the foreseeable future.

However, many investors are often surprised to hear that the number of publicly listed companies has fallen 45% from the peak in 1996, and as shown in this week’s chart, that the number of private companies worth over $1 billion – also known as “unicorns” – has increased over 38 times since the beginning of 2009. While some of this decline has been driven by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), the bulk has been due to the increased availability of private capital.

In fact let’s put it another way.

If assume low rates now lowers the discount rate of your valuation that’s fine. 

But then as growth picks up, surely rates will rise in the future thus:

1) increasing the future discount rate

2) lowering the future growth rate

So the net effect on your model shouldn’t be substantial. "

2018-01-30 09:10:20,"I agree I don't think anything said under myth #2 really makes the case that low interest rates don't lead to higher valuations.  In fact the first line of the paragraph says this: ""Low rates do influence valuations in practice, and the relationship between rates and valuations is tighter than theory suggests it should be. This fact, however, is beside the point.""  What?  Why is that besides the point?  The only real case it make is that your long term yield will be lower if you buy at a high P/E rather than a low one, regardless of rates.  Yes, that is certainly true, and I don't need charts to show me.  All things equal getting a 10% earnings yield today is better in the long term than getting a 5% earnings yield today.  That doesn't change the fact that getting a 5% earnings yield today looks a whole lot more attractive when interest rates are at 2% than when they are at 6%.  I'm sorry when you make a comment like ""the relationship between rates and valuations is tighter than theory suggests it should be."" then its time to re examine your theory and see what you are missing, not say ""this is besides the point.""

You are diluting and thus misallocating those funds that could have gone to productive means. You cannot just digitally print money and expect economic growth. Growth is created through cost cutting and production. It is about allocating limited resources to the most optimal means of production and creating wealth.

This is the exact point which Central banks tackle . Diluting is necessary because people won't do it by themselves, as once an economic crisis happens people stop taking risks because they are scared . 

Without central banks people would move money to developing countries. Central banks are one of the greatest assets for countries to avoid slipping to developing countries."
2019-04-16 10:56:17,"Any money you lend is the money that gets added into the money supply with fractional reserve banking thereby reducing the value of the fiat. You are diluting and thus misallocating those funds that could have gone to productive means. You cannot just digitally print money and expect economic growth. Growth is created through cost cutting and production. It is about allocating limited resources to the most optimal means of production and creating wealth.

This is why China is taking over as the leading economic powerhouse. They copy all of the world's intellectual property and have the cheapest labor with their large population to pump things out very efficiently and export it to the world.  And they produce very efficiently. Buildings get constructed 24/7, day and night. They are running massive trade surpluses and accruing a lot of wealth because *they* are the producers and the world are the consumers."

And how would you calculate IRR using comps vs. DCF? I know for comps its entry price vs. exit price using multiples, but what about DCF? Is the entry price just the market price at which the hedge fund buys in the stock market, and then the exit price is the target price that is derived from the DCF? And then calculate IRR based on this?"

You will get older, and your friends and family will have stories about what happened at their workplace and what they’ve done.

Tesla is not ""leading"" anything environmentally. Production of cars, any cars is damaging. If you want to save the environment just don't ever buy a new car. That is much more helpful than buying a new Tesla. And ""environment"" means a lot more than what affects the climate. I have a 2004 model Toyota myself. I don't eat red meat. And, I rarely buy anything... even though I could buy whatever I want. I am not a Tesla hater. But, are you willing to darn your own socks instead of buying new ones? Do you think most people would give up the status of having a new iPhone and new shoes to save the environment? Or... is it just easier to believe supporting Tesla is the same thing? I am not judging either way.  Tesla, is a crutch psychologically.   


COVID-19 has done more for the environment that Tesla will ever do. It allows people to feel they are doing something good.  Instead of actually doing good

If you buy a new car or order something from Amazon you are destroying the planet. Not just from a CO2 perspective. Tesla factories use a LOT of oil. Manufacturing requires a lot of oil-based chemicals and lubricants. The Earth is ripped asunder to get at the materials needed to make those batteries.   
Tesla pollutes. They may pollute slightly less. But they pollute a hell of a lot more than if we just took the bus.  


Two decades ago kids learned to recycle. Why? Because China wanted to buy our scrap paper. Do we hear about recycling anymore? Are there fewer landfills? Did humanity change?   


If you want to save the planet. Walk, take the bus, ride a bike. If you can't move to a place you can. But, Tesla is just a penny stock to support Elon's ego. He is just profiteering off of people's hope. I am not attacking him for it. That is the why humans work. That is how religion works. That is how Santa works.  


In reality, it would take 10 Earth sized planets full of trees to stop it. We can't ""build"" a device capable of stopping it. Humans have released 100 million years of trapped carbon in the last 100. 100 million years of carbon trapped by the entire planet. You can do the math yourself here. 1 tree on average weighs 2 tons. 50% of that is carbon. There are about 3 trillion trees on Earth. Oil is the product of 155 million years of trees dying. We've released about 100 million years of it into the ocean and atmosphere. How long would it take to get that back out? The answer is... a 100 million years.   


There are two things most humans can not understand. One is scale. Climate change is a problem of scale. Similarly, we will never find aliens. It isn't that life doesn't exist. It's that humans, the whole of humanity, will not survive long enough for us to know. Humans will be extinct. That is how big the universe is. This is something that is hard for most people to understand. The vastness of space is incomprehensible. The amount of CO2 we've released is similarly incomprehensible. Most people don't understand that when they walk around there is between 600 and 700 lbs of air on your head. (Depending on the size of your head).  Thing about that next time you walk around.   


The other thing is that humans are really not in control. Humans can't solve climate change.  Not anymore. But, if it helps to believe, the so be it. But, don't begrudge those that see through the bull shit. Einhorn is correct. But, you never short faith. Faith has been around for tens of millennia.   


Anyways, have good day."

But leading people to go short on a stock like this, that only seems to go up, will lose them a lot of money. Posts on the accounting side of Tesla are merely grasps at straws in hopes for the company to not be as great as the “followers/supporters” say it is. It’s not only bad for the people that are tricked into shorting the stock but it’s also bad for the planet. Why hate a company that’s leading in sustainable transport and energy generation?

2020-05-01 02:47:14,"[Paul Krugman BA (Yale) PhD (MIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman#Early_life_and_education) won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics. He was Economics Prof. at MIT and Princeton. [I reproduced the article below, if NYT pay-walled it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/opinion/economy-stock-market-coronavirus.html)

&gt; The economic news has been terrible. Never mind Wednesday’s [G.D.P. report](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-1st-quarter-2020-advance-estimate) for the first quarter. An economy contracting at an annual rate of almost 5 percent would have been considered very bad in normal times, but this report only captured the first few drops of a torrential downpour. More timely data show an economy [falling off a cliff](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WEI). The [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56335) is projecting an unemployment rate of 16 percent later this year, and that may well be an underestimate.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet [stock prices](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX), which fell in the first few weeks of the Covid-19 crisis, have made up much of those losses. They’re currently more or less back to where they were last fall, when all the talk was about how well the economy was doing. What’s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, whenever you consider the economic implications of stock prices, you want to remember three rules. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.
&gt; 
&gt; That is, the relationship between stock performance — largely driven by the oscillation between greed and fear — and real economic growth has always been somewhere between loose and nonexistent. Back in the 1960s the great economist Paul Samuelson [famously quipped](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/04/can-the-markets-predict-recessions-what-we-found-out.html) that the market had predicted nine of the past five recessions.
&gt; 
&gt; But I’d argue that there are deeper reasons for the current stock market-real economy disconnect: Investors are buying stocks in part because they have nowhere else to go. In fact, there’s a sense in which stocks are strong precisely because the economy as a whole is so weak.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul Krugman’s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy — and an even deeper look at what’s on Paul’s mind.
&gt;
&gt; What, after all, is the main alternative to investing in stocks? Buying bonds. Yet these days bonds offer incredibly low returns. The interest rate on [10-year U.S. government bonds](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10) is only 0.6 percent, down from more than 3 percent in late 2018. If you want bonds that are protected against future inflation, their yield is _minus_ half a percent.
&gt; 
&gt; So buying stock in companies that are still profitable despite the Covid-19 recession looks pretty attractive.
&gt; 
&gt; And why are interest rates so low? Because the bond market expects the economy to be depressed for years to come, and believes that the Federal Reserve will continue pursuing easy-money policies for the foreseeable future. As I said, there’s a sense in which stocks are strong precisely because the real economy is weak.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, one question you might ask is why, if economic weakness is if anything good for stocks, the market briefly plunged earlier this year. The answer is that for a few weeks in March the world [teetered](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system) on the edge of a 2008-type financial crisis, which caused investors to flee everything with the slightest hint of risk.
&gt; 
&gt; That crisis was, however, averted thanks to extremely aggressive actions by the Fed, which stepped in to buy an unprecedented volume and range of assets. Without those actions, we would be facing an even bigger economic catastrophe.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is, by the way, one reason you should be concerned about Donald Trump’s attempts to appoint unqualified loyalists, with a history of supporting [crank economic doctrines](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-03/which-judy-shelton-would-show-up-at-the-fed?sref=qzusa8bC), to the Federal Reserve Board. Imagine where we’d be now if the Fed had responded to a looming financial crisis the way the Trump administration [responded](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-trump-coverup.html) to a looming pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; But back to the disconnect between stocks and economic reality. It turns out that this is a long-term phenomenon, dating back at least to the mid-2000s.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about all the negative things we’ve learned about the modern economy since, say, 2007. We’ve learned that advanced economies are much less stable, much more subject to periodic crises, than almost anyone believed possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Productivity growth has [slumped](https://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm), showing that the information technology-fueled boom of the 1990s and early 2000s was a one-shot affair. Overall economic performance has been much worse than most observers expected around 15 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Stocks, however, have done very well. On the eve of the Covid crisis, the ratio of [market capitalization to G.D.P.](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/) — Warren Buffett’s favorite measure — was well above its 2007 level, and a bit higher than its peak during the dot-com bubble. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; The main answer, surely, is to consider the alternative. While employment eventually recovered from the Great Recession, that recovery was achieved only thanks to historically low interest rates. The need for low rates was an indication of underlying economic weakness: businesses seemed reluctant to invest despite high profits, often preferring to buy back their own stock. But low rates were good for stock prices.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I mention that the stock market is not the economy?
&gt; 
&gt; None of this should be taken as a statement that current market valuations are exactly right. My gut sense is that investors are too eager to seize on good news; but the truth is that I have no idea where the market is headed.
&gt; 
&gt; The point, instead, is that the market’s resilience does, in fact, make some sense despite the terrible economic news — and by the same token does nothing to make that news less terrible. Pay no attention to the Dow; keep your eyes on those disappearing jobs.

However, I believe that there should be concern that other companies will start offering much cheaper delivery choices sooner than people have anticipated.

If you need evidence about buffet search Michael lewis article on warren buffet. He talks about him buying Solomon Brothers and how he talks about one thing and does another. (I don't agree with everything in the article, but he makes some valid points).

He mentions how a reporter wrote an article about Buffets mistress/second wife which he had the paper take out.

Buffet has an image, a mighty fine one. If you look carefully at what he does, has and has done it is sometimes very different from that image and what he says.

When you think of Warren buffet I'm sure you do not think of a man that married his wife's best friend because she left him. You dont think of a man who owns a California beach front property, Rolex watches, expensive suits and private jets because he told you he was so frugal and lives in the same house that he had at 30. You think he is a long term investor but has traded currencies. You think he is about society before profits, but bought Solomon Brothers by making a deal with the CEO who he indirectly criticized as being corrupt and leading a institution run by careless greed and diserving customer bases. 

The man's image is impeccable. He gets away with a lot. He says his favorite book was dale carinagie, ""How to Win Friends and INFLUENCE PEOPLE"" and it's worked.

This serves him well, not only in $ because people feel honored to sell at a lower price than normal to such a noble man but in that his reputation will surpass his wealth. He needs no more money, now it's just about legacy.

2020-04-30 20:35:14,"DPZ is something I've recently begun following as well. It's obviously a great business with a sexy consumer-facing story (some of which you've touched on), but much of the obvious upside seems already priced in and the current risk / reward is not immediately compelling. My initial impression of the situation is below -- apologies if any posters above have already mentioned, and discussion more than welcome.

First, and to your point, DPZ exhibits many obvious characteristics of great franchise models and, more generally, good businesses. DPZ is the industry leader in a resilient category: food tends to be defensive, and DPZ is further positioned at the value end of that spectrum. The business is capital efficient and highly scalable, with annuity-like CFs and meaningful growth opportunities available both domestically &amp; abroad. Like many successful franchisers, DPZ enjoys a marketing flywheel effect as a result of (i) systemwide advertising reinvestments and (ii) a sophisticated and well-capitalized franchisee base, which create a dynamic in which scale begets further scale. Furthermore, the company enjoys solid franchisee relationships and strong 4-wall economics (average U.S. unit has \~$350k startup cost, \~$140k EBITDA, and &lt;3yr payback).

Slightly more interestingly, DPZ benefits from several structural advantages that position it as a likely longer-term winner in food delivery. DPZ’s unique vertical integration (of supply chain, kitchen &amp; delivery), fortressing strategy, and tech infrastructure allow the company to consistently outcompete aggregators on the basis of delivery speed and price. Vertical integration enables smoother kitchen execution and allows DPZ to avoid hefty \~20-30% aggregator fees (which, in contrast, lead many competitors to raise prices on the delivery platforms); these cost savings are passed through to DPZ’s customers. Through fortressing, DPZ strategically positions its store base to increase delivery route density, which leads to faster deliveries, more satisfied drivers, and more profitable per-delivery economics. Various tech improvements (i.e., GPS tracking of drivers; ordering via Alexa / Google Home, etc.) over the years have helped drive throughputs and created more seamless customer experiences.

Although competition from delivery aggregators is currently a headwind, DPZ may also benefit from eventual “rationalization” of the landscape. The current environment is perceived as unsustainable since the platforms are generally pricing below cost. Potential catalysts such as greater investor pressure (perhaps resulting from DoorDash’s planned IPO), eventual reductions in funding (notably, DoorDash &amp; Uber Eats are both Softbank-backed), M&amp;A, and others should be industry positives. To the M&amp;A point, GrubHub has already undergone strategic review, although as an aside, I'm skeptical of acquirers’ ability &amp; willingness to pay (as someone unknowledgeable about the industry). Rationalization might not occur in the near-term but can be treated as a longer-term call option on the company.

Several other qualitative factors are encouraging and help justify value:

* DPZ has meaningful growth opportunities ahead. Independent players make up a significant portion of domestic &amp; global market share, suggesting presence of further white space. The #1 player in other QSR concepts (i.e., burgers) have higher global share than DPZ does in pizza (i.e., 25%+, relative to DPZ at \~20%), so there are precedents for growth beyond what DPZ has already achieved.
* DPZ owns its customer relationships (notably with 20mm+ members in its loyalty rewards program) and does not share data with aggregators or other third parties. This is a valuable data repository, potentially providing value creation opportunities that are legitimate but not immediately obvious to anticipate / quantify from an outsider's perspective.
* DPZ's recent pilot of its tech-enabled employee scheduling tool in Phoenix reduced a point of labor costs. This is another example of an opportunity that can be difficult to predict / quantify. However, given management's track record of integrating technology, further upside of this nature may exist.
* DPZ is likely an attractive takeout target if price sinks too low. Various consolidators show interest in the QSR space (i.e., 3G / QSR, JAB, Yum Brands), and DPZ has scarcity value as a proven global brand with a uniquely vertically integrated business model and attractive, consumer-facing digital assets.
* COVID-19 shutdowns should enable DPZ to widen its differential vs. smaller / independent operators.

However, these are all obvious business merits that investors fully appreciate in the current valuation. By my calculations, the current stock price (\~$360) assumes full realization of mgmt.’s 2025 guidance of 25,000 stores &amp; $25bn systemwide sales, with systemwide same-store sales comping at 5-6% over this time period (representing the upper range of mgmt.’s 3-6% guidance). These assumptions are likely overly optimistic given the persistent deceleration of DPZ’s domestic and international comps over the last few years.

I think 5-6% annual comp growth over the medium term is an unrealistic baseline for the domestic market. In the U.S., DPZ drives comp from mix shift and transaction growth (the company seldom raises prices), with the latter perceived by investors as the healthier of the two. Unfortunately, transaction growth has been stagnant (unsurprising given the maturity of the concept in the U.S.), with recent improvements short-lived: DPZ’s introduction of its loyalty program contributed 1-4% yoy transaction growth over 2018, but failed to have incremental positive impacts in 2019. Mix shift has been the sole source of SSS growth over the LTM, typically contributing only 1.5-3% yoy. Further headwinds from aggregators and the company’s own fortressing strategy should continue to persist over the medium term – these factors are already embedded in guidance, but I bring them up because they are unlikely to be sources of upside surprise. In other words, it seems unlikely that DPZ can consistently bridge to MSD domestic comp growth.

DPZ’s international segment is much trickier to analyze given its diversity of end markets. I don’t have a view on the international business, other than to say that DPZ seems unlikely to re-accelerate to MSD comps after having spent the last two years in LSD territory, especially when confronted with various idiosyncratic &amp; macro challenges in its larger markets. As a surface-level snapshot, DPZ has historically performed very well in India, its largest foreign market, but the country faces the dual challenge of a weakening economic environment (from pre-coronavirus) and severe food inflation. In the UK, the company’s second largest market, DPZ is contending with several issues including a long standoff with its franchisee base, driven by slowing growth and margin pressures; recent executive turnover; intense competition from aggregators; and historically poor execution in neighboring countries. Other core markets (Australia / New Zealand, Western Europe ex. UK) have seen similar deceleration in comps over the last two years.

So long story short – I think this is a good company / stock to own, but personally wouldn't buy in at \~$360. The stock can certainly realize further upside, but to be bullish at $360, you'd need high conviction in further upside beyond the lofty expectations already priced in."

He has admitted that he has the need to be liked and loved by people. He doesn't want to create envy in others so he makes it seem like he doesn't live in luxury or make money a top priority, but he does. Multiple times he has gone back on his word. Charlie is a better role model in this regard as far as I know.

As for him moving money to where is needed, again totally dissagree. He adds no value to society thorough investing (he admits this which is why he signed the giving pledge).He simply profits from undervalued mispriced opportunities. He is not funding start ups. Somebody is going to hold the business. He doesn't make anyone's life better (except his investors) by buying coke at $20 when it's really worth $40."

2020-04-30 18:43:02,"Let's dissect that.

Since inception, he's returned 9.6% gross, 5.1% net (annualized). That's a pretty decent track record. It's even better for the manager who's clipping 4.5% of AUM annually while taking zero personal risk, for arguably mediocre performance. This ain't no Rentec. You get those numbers when the manager is essentially issuing himself annual call options for free on a volatile portfolio. Put another way - taking 50% of the upside in fees is pretty fucking egregious.

Then, there's the portfolio. He says the median market cap was $150m at the end of '19 and $125m at the end of Q1. By my math, that's a 16% decline. In order to eke out a 37% decline with that portfolio, you were either levered with 100%+ gross or levered via options. That makes the return profile suspect - are you just looking at a 3x levered book that returns 5% annualized? Also, how investable is this mediocre book? As a non 13-D filer, you can get max positions of 5% across this book, so that's $7.5m (at $150m) per position. For a concentrated book (let's say 20 positions to be generous), that's a max allocation of $150m you can make to this manager.

I'm going to go on a limb and say this manager (like many who get their LPs from Reddit/Twitter) is just out to fleece unsuspecting mid-net worth individuals by charging high effective fees on a levered, volatile portfolio where he sells the mark with plausible stories about the underlying companies.

Also who said variance was bad..? We all want minimum downside variance but we all love upside variance. Simple optimizations fail to take this preference into account.

I find portfolio optimization a slippery slope, as a value investor I find myself correlating the weights of my portfolio in line with how undervalued a company is. For instance a company that is 300% undervalued will receive 6x the weighting than something that is only 50% undervalued. Because I only choose 1 stock per industry group my stocks typically carry a low correlation

If you don’t like their dividend or buyback policy, well, it’s a Chinese company so don’t expect an activist to come around and demand changes. You basically have no recourse if management wants to screw their investor base. That alone makes it a pass from me, but good luck if you stick with it."

2021-05-15 03:08:18,"Thanks for the post. I enjoyed this.

I'm not expert at this stuff but here goes.

I read the 10k. This company is a turn around story and its business model seems straightforward to understand. I feel like the auditor or management (who ever wrote the 10k) isn't a bull-shitter. 

Sounds like the local government is making life hard for these guys by forcing environmental  shutdowns. One particular eyebrow raiser was that the company had approval to develop natural gas wells and then after they finished the wells, they were immediately shut down by the government. What the hell. Sounds like these local governments are disorganized. (Hard to believe they'll end being our benevolent overlords; Praise be Xi Jinpings and his alone)

Nice balance sheet. They have lots of cash, hardly any debt. They can pay all their liabilities with cash on hand, and still have about 60% of their cash left. The share count outstanding increased slightly YOY.

They have positive cash flow from operation. They don't expect to have to need to borrow or issue share to operate for the next year. They don't plan on dividends.

they are not profitable currently, but a lot of their capacity is still offline. I thought I read that bromine, for example, was only 25% production capacity utilized. Maybe they can get more production happening.

My main concern is that it could be a fraud. I don't trust the oversight of these companies. I have some BABA and I'm nervous about it. I think that a small cap chemical manufacturer in a random region of china is too much for me. I probably wouldn't sleep.

I also have some questions: Is this an ADR? what's this company doing being listed in US? Why do they have such a low amount of liabilities? Is that a cultural thing of china that I don't understand? I would've expected a company with a lot of factories and plants to have huge debts.

Overall, its an easy company to understand (i think...) and I think the financials warrant consideration. The main thing is that they pull off the turnaround."

I'm not one to time the markets, so my gut is to make some investments. I'll still have a very healthy cash position so it's nothing too far out on the risk spectrum (by my qualitative measure of risk), but I can't help but want to optimize.

The blog is pretty clear about the meaningful fallout portion of the equation. But unless I missed it, it didn't address the assertion that ""we are likely to eventually end up with high inflation"". Lots of people have been asserting this same thing since the GFC, and inflation (at least, consumer based inflation), was nowhere to be found.

In the spirit of inverting the thesis, is the expectation of increased inflation incorrect?

2021-05-13 19:17:06,"The article is saying that this won't happen because what could drive prices is changes in cost of capital/liquidity.

This view is correct, although proving it is slightly convoluted. But if you look at countries that have bank-led financial markets (i.e. low allocation to equities at the aggregate level) then you find lower valuations generally, which kind of proves the point that there is not some objective value of a cash flow (you can look at M2/total household wealth for example, to get a picture of liquidity).

Either way, to return to your question, neither of these things will occur because the fundamentals of inflation likely don't matter. This happened in 1968, the market was scalding hot, valuations were very high...inflation starts, and the market prolapses until \~1974, it didn't matter that real assets were a hedge or whatever. No-one cared, they just sold.

It isn't clear where we are. The inflation of the 70s was the coincidence of multiple things at the wrong time. But 5%+ inflation seems possible given the political situation in the US. I don't think there is any easy way to outperform. I have been looking at natural resources seriously for the first time ever. But these stocks will likely get carried down too. There will be no escape, when people need cash then they need it. It doesn't matter."

2021-05-12 17:35:56,"Great find and a great guide. I am a fan of Lyn and follow her on twitter.

I still think this project is worthwhile though.   


Lyn is writing a broad inflation guide with a few bits on hyperinflation, but hyperinflation is not the core focus. It is a more extreme beast. Let me illustrate with an example:

She writes ""Both gold and silver did exceptionally well in the 1970s inflationary period.""

  
In many of the hyperinflations I've looked at, governments ban and confiscate precious metals early on to save their currencies. So investing in gold is probably a bad idea over the long time (which during hp is pretty short)."
2021-05-12 13:40:58,"It's an interesting thought experiment to go back in history and ask yourself, ""What would or *should* I have done?""

For example, there were many issues in the markets before the crash of 1929. If you had excellent foresight, you might have started to sell things off around 1925 or 1926. The market would increase about 150% to the peak in 1929 from there. You might have felt like a damned fool during that period, but we know what was ahead... over the next 2-3 years, the S&amp;P500 would have declined about 80%.

Effectively, if you stayed out of the market from 1925 through 1931 or 1932, you'd have been given some **amazing** opportunities to make investments, at least if you really knew what you were doing and engaged in thorough research. 

But to be an investor and sit on your rear end for 7 years? That's not easy.

I haven't taken a lot of time to study Grantham's predictions, but your list makes it sound like he's just talking as rationally as one could. No one knows exactly when or why the markets will turn, but it sure it much easier to know when things are obviously cheap or obviously expensive. 

I have a feeling this is a bit of why Buffett has so much cash and why Munger talks about Warren's ability to ""sit around and not do too much"" as a quality. Opportunities don't always come when you have cash, but rather when others need it. The wait can be long and painful though."

2021-05-11 23:05:01,"Investing titan Jeremy Grantham made prescient calls about the bursting of bubbles in 2000 and 2008.


In an interview, he said the current market was eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble.


He also shared the four indicators that have lined up for the biggest wipeout of value. 



When Jeremy Grantham declared in January that ""the long, long bull market

since 2009 has finally matured into a fully fledged epic bubble,"" he said he knew there would be ""a substantial increase in crazy behavior"" before it all came crashing down. 

The cofounder of Boston's Grantham, Mayo, van Otterloo &amp; Co. is famous for having made prescient calls about the bursting of the 1989 Japanese asset-price bubble, the 2000 tech bubble, and the 2008 real-estate bubble.

""The thing about a bubble is if you can find more money and more crazy investors, it can keep going,"" he told Insider. 

As it played out, what Grantham saw in the fourth quarter as ""extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior"" escalated into even more remarkable events in the first quarter of this year. 

From the epic short squeeze in GameStop to the stratospheric rally of Dogecoin, the latest bout of market euphoria has even taken the spotlight away from special-purpose acquisition companies, which have raised $101.5 billion this year and secured $83.4 billion last year — more than the previous seven years combined. 
'This is eerily like 2000'

To Grantham, the tales of frenzy and mania today are eerily reminiscent of the tech bubble, but signs of cracks are already appearing in the SPAC market, where a sentiment shift, an oversupply, and regulatory scrutiny have led the IPOX SPAC Index down 23% from its February peak. 

Grantham, a Model 3 owner, said Tesla's price slump was another sign of the mania unwinding. The electric-vehicle maker's stock, which rose nearly eightfold in 2020, has fallen about 24% from its peak in January despite having delivered ""brilliant"" earnings results for the past two quarters.

""So this is eerily like 2000,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it might end tomorrow or just be a blip.""


In his view, the bursting of bubbles comes slowly and then all at once. For example, in 2000, the downfall started with Pets.com in March and then migrated to more respected small tech companies in April before hammering away midcap companies in June and Cisco — briefly the largest company — in July. 

By September, the tech sector, which had been 30% of the market, was down about 50%. But the S&amp;P 500 was unchanged, and investors started to dismiss what had transpired as a healthy rotation, Grantham said. 

""What it was really is the lack of confidence began to leak, not surprisingly, from those areas with the craziest amount of confidence where people had lost touch completely with any underlying fundamentals,"" he said. ""And then that spread through the system to merely enthusiastic stocks and finally reached the major market.""

Eventually, the music stopped entirely. In September, the 70% of the market that had not been affected rolled over and dropped 50% in the following two years. 

""It's like the termites that were nibbling away and working their way down,"" he said. ""When they covered enough ground slicing away like that, they stopped slicing and went for the rest of the market en masse.""
4 indicators have lined up 

This time, the combination of the massive fiscal-stimulus program and the effective rollout of vaccinations is likely to push the bubble to last longer, according to Grantham. 

But he doesn't think it will change the outcome where asset prices revert to a more reasonable level and investors enter a more pessimistic phase. ""What it means is the higher you go, the bigger the fall,"" he said. 

Grantham used the classic example of Japan, which inflated the biggest stock-market bubble of any developed country in the 1980s.

""At the time, everyone believed it was 65 times earnings,"" he said of the price-to-earnings ratio on the Nikkei. ""So that was just massive. The consequence is we are now 32 years later and the market is still not back where it was in 1989 in Japan.""

Similar to how Japan suffered from a ""lost decade"" of economic stagnation following the collapse of the asset-price bubble in 1991, another thing to consider in a bubbly environment is the negative-wealth effect, Grantham said. 

While the burst of the dot-com bubble dragged down the stock market, the net drag on the American economy was over pretty quickly. By comparison, the 2008 financial crisis affected not only Americans with stock portfolios but also ordinary homeowners who were sucked into the real-estate bubble. 

The housing market has become dangerously overheated once again, with multiple gauges of housing-market activity resembling their pre-2008 levels.

""Looking at the inventory of housing and looking at the availability of money sloshing around in the system,"" Grantham said, ""it is almost certain that, in the next few months, the US the housing market will pass the previous all-time high of 2006 and will establish a new high multiple of family income.""

Another indicator flashing warning signals is the bond market, which has become perhaps more expensive than stocks as a material chunk of global sovereign debt has negative yields, meaning that investors pay to lend governments their money. 

Aside from stocks, bonds, and real estate all being prohibitively expensive, commodities are also flashing warning signs. Driven by a global supply-chain shortage, commodities such as lumber, copper, steel, wheat, and cotton have all experienced huge price surges to reach multiyear highs. West Texas Intermediate crude oil had bounced back from minus $38 per barrel to about $65 as of Friday in just over a year. 

When commodity prices soar to record highs, the economy is vulnerable to a sharp contraction as consumers become more reluctant to make purchases and lofty prices of raw materials erode the margins of manufacturers. Specifically, surging oil prices were followed by recessions in every decade from the 1970s through the 2000s. A case in point is the 2008 oil shock, when oil prices hit $140 a barrel in the summer of 2008 from just $50 a barrel in early 2007.

To be sure, similar signs of asset-price bubbles are shooting up around the world, but ""in America, we have the real McCoy, we've got everything lined up,"" Grantham said.

As the ""craziest, most overconfident, and overpriced stocks"" such as Tesla start to show weaknesses while the rest of the market continues to go up as it did in 2000, the end might just be in sight, he added. 

""This is pretty bad on a very broad front,"" he said. ""We will have to live, potentially, possibly, with the biggest loss of perceived value from assets that we have ever seen."""
2021-05-11 23:04:56,"I've been thinking more about this, and I've come to the conclusion that ephemeral aspects of management influence the story of the company. This in turn affects my estimation of how things might turn out. You can put that estimation into an expected value calculation. 

E.g. there's an 60% chance the company will take action A, leading to a value of $1 mil, and a 40% chance of them taking action B, where it'll be worth $500k. In this case, the EV is $800k. My judgement of management may lead me to conclude that action A is actually 80%, not 60%, so the EV would be higher.

Since only IPOs and secondary fund raises provide cash to companies, he's saying that ""if you stay within the stock investment class, you help send some of that money towards real investment""

This implies that companies should never return money to investors.  And then implies that we need to corrupt society into a bad investment for the good of society.

We can also notice that the corruption is failing if companies are paying more to investors (buybacks+dividends) than raising IPO investment.  According to author, its bad if investors get paid more than they put in.

Buffet/Munger's reasons for not investing in stores of value is actually a very good reason to invest in them when stocks are over valued at 22 PE.

Author also says something like:
&gt; The utility of bitcoin is the same at $100 ($2B market cap) as it is at $57k ($1.1T market cap).

This is obviously false, as the utility of bitcoin is capital mobility and liquidity.  This increases with value.  Btc is much more mobile than gold, but even at a lower total capitalization is already more liquid than gold in part due to its divisibility, but also ample markets and quick resell turnaround time option for accepting payment."

This revenue can either increase because it grows in real or nominal terms.

Normally, those are all the right variables to create inflation. 

I think I agree that we (including economists) just aren't good at it. There are days where I have no clue if we're going to be living in a world of 3-7% inflation for the next decade or -1 to +3% indefinitely. I'm learning to just say, ""I have no darn clue.""

I know the CBO measures potential GDP, but it’s not clear that’s what matters. Maybe what matters is slack in specific areas, depending on wherever the spending is directed to. And some of those measures of slack might not even just be domestic, but international. This means one country’s ability to run a deficit is dependent on what others do. You can’t all chase copper for example, but if others are not, then it’s easier to do so. I know this isn’t a great example, but I just generally agree that it depends on the scarcity of what you’re chasing. Inflation isn’t a guarantee, nor is the lack of it."

I know this seems crazy, but if the goods and services they spend it towards don’t push up inflation, it might not be as inflationary. It’s like if they use it for things that need copper, and there’s a copper shortage, you’ll cause inflation in the process of forcing it out of the economy. Mines have a geological limits. If you use the deficit for other goods, it might not be as inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

Contributing to . . . euphoria are two further factors little noted in our time or in past times. The first is the extreme brevity of the financial memory. In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten. In further consequence, when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again, sometimes in only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and larger economic world. There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.

2022-05-27 09:17:24,"I find working capital harder for companies to control. Like it you have high receivable days, and decide to go back to your customers and tell them that going forward you’re going to give them only 30 days to pay instead of 90, I’m quite sure they will be pissed about the abrupt change. Same for payables. If you suddenly start paying much later, you lose the trust of your suppliers. Inventory is the only one you can control internally probably, and even that these days is hard with all the exogenous shocks to supply chains.

In other words, if working capital is out of line with historical or industry peers, I wouldn’t bet on a company being able to bring it in line."

2022-05-25 13:22:38,There was one formula in Nomad partnership letters which was 2.1 * prob of being right - 1.1.  Not sure if that’s Kelly’s criteria referenced above. But agree overall - position sizing has been a relatively untouched topic.
2022-05-25 12:23:43,"The article says they couldn't think of anything about position sizing: Kelly Criterion. That is it, that is the mathematically optimal size.

Equity investors are close to the worst at position sizing. I believe this is because they all do the CFA which teaches you nothing practical about actually managing money. Macro funds do this well, and most of them came from prop, not a CFA in sight (there are structural reasons for this too btw, but it is also cultural).

Either way, George Soros' autobiography is one of the best books on this subject. He followed his trades through a year. He was wrong about almost everything. Finished the year up 100%. It isn't only how often you are right but how much you make when you are right. 

So position sizing isn't only an expression of confidence (the idea of a ""best ideas"" funds therefore betrays logic) but something you take up and down based on: probability of outcome, and the gain/loss in each case...which is just Kelly.

Also, something to bear in mind is that the return on the average stock is negative, so it is very difficult to have a 50%+ win rate over any long period. And if you sell your winners quickly, it is almost impossible to make money. Equity fund managers have often made money despite terrible position sizing, because if something can move 10x then it doesn't matter if your initial size was off. This is also why you can make money with a portfolio of 100 stocks (I used to think this was impossible, but if you are investing in markets with a fat right tail...it is possible, I know an EM fund manager that ran 150+ stocks for decades and is up 1000% over benchmark. I know a global equities manager, they run close to $100bn now, they invested in FAST in 1990...that was it, firm got acquired, everyone made bank, partners are making $15-20m/year...a reputation built on one decision made by someone else, thirty years ago)."
2022-05-25 10:06:12,"
“Personally, I was shocked to discover that only 49% of the very best investment ideas made money.

Even more shocking was that some of these legendary investors were only successful 30% of the time.

What really fascinated me was the fact that, despite some of them only making money on one out of every three investments, overall almost all of them did not lose money. In fact they still made a lot of it.”

Naturally, the rest of the book is about how this happened. And, as you might’ve guessed by now, what allowed these investors to do this was all about position-sizing – how they navigated the ups and downs of their ideas."

2022-05-22 12:03:25,"The thing is, he could have been right the whole time. If you started to call a bubble or had concern with how banks were structured in 1925, you would have been right, but the peak wasn't until 1929, and the market bounced back in the following year. But what laid ahead were years of declines. Judging someone on a short term outcome, which can be as long as a decade, isn't easy in my opinion. I try to pass less judgement but use their views as something to absorb and learn from. Grantham got Japan and dot-com bubble right, and so I give him some credit. Shiller got the dot-com and housing bubble right, and his latest long term expectation on interest rates as a bit of irrational exuberance has been out for years without being right. It doesn't mean he's right or wrong.

There are some business specific situations where I come to the conclusion that it could blow up once every 20 or 30 years, and so I have to avoid it the whole time, because I don't like that risk. Would I be wrong for saying this risk, even if the stock keeps going up every year?"

2022-05-20 09:27:50,"My favorite corollary to this is from Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville:

&gt; Here is what ‘Adam Smith’ — after I told him about Walter — wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

&gt;He has no connections or access to useful information. Practically no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas. He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual reports, and that’s about it.

In introducing me to (Schloss) Warren had also, to my mind, described himself. ‘He never forgets that he is handling other people’s money, and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to loss.’ He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself. Money is real to him and stocks are real — and from this flows an attraction to the ‘margin of safety’ principle.

&gt;Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at considerably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does. He doesn’t worry about whether it it’s January, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks than I do — and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the business; I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter. That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him."

2016-03-01 13:36:00,"Thanks, its been interesting and I have enjoyed it! I would be interested to see your AMA. 

1) There can be conflits between the two, but the way we utilize it there are a lot of synergies. When it comes to stock selection, we are first and foremost a fundamental shop. None of our picks are the result of screens. However when it comes to portfolio construction, trade execution and risk management, thats where I feel the quantitative process shines. I think quants can do an excellent job of stock selection as well and our firm will probably be 100% quantitative one day, but so far we have resisted that because our founding partners are very much fundamental/discreationary guys at heart. When I first came on board, our fundamental group was more of an Event Driven, value w/ a catalyst shop dominated by risk arbitrage, special situations, high yield &amp; distressed credit, and long/short value. Over time we migrated more toward long/short equity with a focus on quality as we came to the realization that while its nice to have a catalyst, if it doens't play out your stuck in a value trap vs buying higher quality companies that will continue to compound earnings. My move into quant came about in early to mid 2000's. I started looking at what our quant guys were doing and asked if I could borrow one. They were leaps and bounds ahead of what we were doing when it came to portfolio construction, risk management and trade execution. 

2) I think anytime you mix illiquidity with quarterly redemptions you are asking for trouble. If I were running a family office or closed-end style fund where I didn't have to worry about redemptions I would end up running a mix of public and private investments all based on relative opportunity. In the past I have been involved in distressed, PIPE's, SPACs and even private lending. I haven't done any control or activist investing though. I think there are really good oportunities in those spaces, but it just doesn't work when you have to manage liquidity.  

2b) I can't think of any off the top of my head, most look OK at first and then end up blowing up. Not because they are wrong necessarily, but they just suffer a run on the bank. I think what Richard Rainwater did with Bass Brothers is the style I would attempt to emulate. A mix of public, private and third party managers as well as a blend of quantitative strategies and fundamental, long term holdings if I were managing permanent capital. The quant strategies would essentially be a holding place until an opportunity became available in public or private markets. Third party managers would be skewed towards smaller, early stage quant where I would own a stake in the firm and would utilize a seperate account so that I could take advantage of my own back office to realize operational efficiences, maintain liquidity, and for risk management purposes.  

3) Yes, to some degree. I really enjoy the portfolio management part but the management stuff I don't care for so much. "
2016-03-01 13:24:57,"I've pretty much been operating under the assumption that at the end of the day, you can't turn deep dive fundamental research driven investing over to the quants. Do you think that's the case? "

2016-03-01 08:39:50,"We would pay them out of the partners pockets.

Yes each group has its own High Water Mark as well as one for the firm. I both love and loathe the HWM. I feel like they are wonderful tool for investors but at the same time I have seen time and time again where a fund will post a losing year, the talent flees to a either a different shop or they close and reopen under a new name so no high water mark. The other scenario that I see a lot and happened to us, was that investors will pull money after a down year and then come back after a good year. When they pulled their money they lost the benefit of their high water mark. Granted, one of the main reasons they redeemed from us was that we were liquid and had not utilized gates or sidepockets, so I guess it worked out in the end. Its kind of ridiculous really and defeats the purpose. Plus, we had been closed to new money so when we reopened we had some decent inflows from new investors that didn't have the previous high water mark. 

I really feel like our risk controls and strategy mix will prevent us from having an awful year. In 2008, our systematic global macro group did an outstanding job. Had we been able to trade thru the crisis, our long/short group would have ended up doing well because we would have been in a net short position. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, we moved to a heavy cash position and missed many opportunities because we did not know if we were going to even have a viable business model the next day. Redemptions were coming in and we felt an obligation to actually meet them, unlike some firms. "

One thing I will add is that B school isn't a prerequisite. It really helps, but there are a lot of people at our firm and in the industry that never went. If your trying to make the transition from one career field to this one, it may be more important. If your coming out of an IBK analyst program, worked on a desk, have experience working long only, or have been a sell side analyst you can make the transition without going to b school.

2016-02-29 14:52:56,"I would describe it as growth is simply growth in Sales, Earnings, Cash Flow, Book Value and when applicable dividends. Momentum is more of a technical measure, in my opinion. It is really another way of saying serial correlation. For the most part, the two kinda go hand in hand in the sense that a company that is consistently growing will see their stock price rising, or vice versa.  

Personally, I don't feel standard deviation is a good risk measure. Professionally, everyone else does and so I'm somewhat beholden to it. I think downside deviation is a better measure when evaluating a manager or strategy. 

When evaluating hedge funds, I prefer to look at what the underlying factors they bring to the table. For instance, most arbitrage strategies are really nothing more than a combination of short puts and illiquidity, whereas CTA's are generally long volatility. Knowing this, if I want true diversification and downside protection, I am more apt to add CTA manager to my portfolio vs a merger arb or convert arb guy because when the world blows up the CTA is going to benefit vs the arb guy who is going to get crushed. Speaking of factors, I think investors greatly underestimate the risk of illiquidity. It looks great because it gives the appearance of bringing stabilility and low vol, but in reality when the write downs come or when it comes time to trade it you get slaughtered. 

We use a predictive beta when constructing our long and short portfolio's. For the most part, I don't see a big difference between the two but we optimize and trade our positions daily. I'm not sure how accurate we would be if we went further out and tried to predict beta or volatility over a longer horizon. "

2016-02-29 10:43:33,"Thank you. Yeah, I'll keep answering as long as they keep coming in!

When a thesis doesn't prove out, I blow out of the position. For the most part, we don't rely on catalyst. We stick to higher quality companies. Good margins, good returns, low debt, management incentives, etc... I like to think our catalyst is that the companies will compound earnings and book value. 

As for smoke signals, we watch the numbers. We have our estimates of what kind of range we expect those to fall in. We don't try to predict EPS to the penny each and every quarter, but we know what range they should come in at. Sales, margins, ROA/ROE/ROIC, accruals are all things we would watch. If these start to deteriorate, thats a red flag. Management generally sells stock via 10b5-1 plans all the time, so thats not a big deal but when we see management bailing on their companies shares. Red flag. 

We also watch the stock. If it drops and we cannot explain, we bail. In my opinion, one mistake I see people make is that they will immediately add to a position when it drops instead of investigating why. When you think you should double down you should probably sell and when your ready to finally capitulate thats when you should probably be buying or doubling down if that makes sense? "

Any tips for starting off on the right foot and getting a full-time offer?"
2016-02-29 03:21:30,"In the case of Tiffany &amp; Co., more shares were issued than repurchased. A company can do both at the same time. This is why you should focus on net buybacks (change in shares outstanding, cash paid for repurchases - cash received from the issuance of common stock in the cash flow statement), not on the company's announcement to buyback shares

As noted before, share repurchases reduce shares outstanding, no matter if retired or not. Since all per-share numbers as book value per share or EPS are defined as ""... divided by shares outstanding"", they increase proportionally when shares outstanding decrease.

Because the number of shares decrease, every single share's fraction of the companies assets, earnings and dividends increases. As the value per share increases, the stock price may increase as well. So a buyback tends to be positive for owners of common stock.

But there may be a more efficient use for the company's money, like (re)investing, acquisitions, paying dividends, paying down debt or just saving the money to increase liquidity.

For example, if the company could generate a return on equity of 12% with an investment into the company's operations, but instead repurchases shares at a Price to earnings ratio of 20, it yields a poor 5% return for their stockholders instead of 12%, all other things being equal.

There are some reasons why managements might tend to buy back shares, even when it is not the most efficient use for excess capital.

1.) Managements often are evaluated and paid on the basis of per share numbers. Moreover, employee stock options are tied to the share price. Decreasing the numbers of shares outstanding via buybacks is the most easy way to improve per share numbers in the short term and support the share price.

2.) Buybacks conceal the negative effect of employee stock options, which increase the number of shares outstanding when exercised. So the company may have paid a considerable proportion of the earnings to the management, even though the numbers per share were unchanged.

3.)When the management fears to miss the analysts (per share) estimates, it may repurchase shares to obscure the management's problems in reaching an over-optimistic guidance."
2016-02-29 02:15:14,"Hey, great AMA. if you are still answering, How do you react when a thesis blows up? i.e. if you were wrong on a position, short or long? An in hindsight to any such event, do you have any smoke signals to watch out for?"
2016-02-29 01:38:51,Thanks!
2016-02-29 01:33:23,"lol Well, my whole philosophy is based on protecting my downside. When trades go against me, I will cut exposure. My motto is live to fight another day. I know what I do works over the long term. I also know that not every environment is going to be good for what I do. I am not going to be a double up to catch up kind of guy. If its not a good market for me, I will move to cash and wait until a more opportune time. When things are going my way then I will increase exposure. I guess thats a long winded way of saying, don't lose it! The reason why I say that is, you see it as $20K of fun money you lose today. I see it as you loosing $300,000 in 20 years ($20,000 invested in the market, earning 7% a year with an additional $5,000 added per year) My advice, put it in an index fund and deposit another $5,000 per year. 

So, with al that being said, if your bound and determined to invest in stocks I would say look at the consumer sector. I really, really believe the consumer is stronger than they are getting credit for. I have mentioned AAPL, KORS and GPS in a previous post as names we currently own. Thats a good place to start I think. Research those and see if you like them. Work on coming up with an estimate of what you think they will be worth in 3-5 years. Discount that back to today using whatever your hurdle rate is. I think 15% is a good rate, but feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with. Compare that value to the current price. If it is trading at a 75-80% discount to your estimate of fair value, I'd say you probably have a winner. If its trading at a 90% discount you may want to check your assumptions. "

2016-02-28 22:46:07,"For the most part, I'm looking for people with relevant expereince. I like IBK because thats where I came from and they have the modeling skills I need them to have. Plus we have all been thru the same haze. Maybe thats ridiculous, but it counts becaue I know what I can expect from them. I know how they think and how they act. I hired one guy that doesn't have an IBK backgroud. To get on our team, the team has to want you. I could override them but I don't. 

I'm happy to look at an idea you like and give you feedback. To give you some idea of what our team does: each analyst covers a sector and is an expert on that sector. They maintain models for every company in their universe and sort them into deciles by price to value. Because we are long/short are ideas are all judged on their relative merits. If you have 50 names in your universe, you are expected to have 5 longs and 5 shorts.

I can only assume that when I say no degree many people would turn you away simply based on the risk of hiring an unknown quantitiy, however insofar as showing that you're passionate and a better than average, would that in some way narrow that quality of being an unknown? Especially considering that there have been some notable investors that had no formal education, Walter Schloss being the main example coming to mind."
2016-02-28 22:14:54,"I think Warren is a genius. I mean, if I was running my own capital, didn't have to worry about redemptions or volatility I would run a similar approach to what he espouses: run a concentrated 8-12 name portfolio with low turnover. 

In all honesty, probably not. To be fair, thats how Michael Burry got his start if I'm not mistaken. He was posting ideas on a bulletin board and Joel Greenblatt found him. Called him up and gave him some money to run. That ultimately didn't work out when he decided to short subprime, but all's well that ends well. So it's doable. "

What are your thoughts on Warren Buffett and his aproach to investing. I understand it differs in many ways from your own strategy.

Also, would you ever take seriously someone that is self taught, (no degree, but utilized a number of resources) but could demonstrate talent and knowledge in investing that goes beyond that of your average analyst?"
2016-02-28 21:55:06,"Yeah, some of the bigger names I like Joel Greenblatt, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, most of the Tiger Cubs, Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, George Soros. In the long only world I really like the guys at IVA. There are a  number of quantitative managers and smaller long/short guys that I think are very smart but they fly under the radar. 

Each analyst follows a specific industry and follows it very closely. He is the SME and ranks every company in his universe by decile or price to value. We use a 3-5 year time frame. The top decile becomes our long portfolio and bottom decile becomes our short portfolio. 

We do a quality of earnings analysis as part of our due diligence, mainly looking at accruals. We also scrutinize anything on the balance sheet that is subject to someone elses valuation, for instance illiquid assets. Regarding illiqiud assets there is a joke I like about interviewing accountants that goes: 1st guy comes in and you ask him, whats 1+1? He says 2. Thank you for coming by. Second guy comes by, same thing. Thanks for coming by. Third person comes in and says, what do you want it to be? Thats the guy you hire!

Serial aquirers can be good and bad. I mean, Buffett is a serial aquirer and he has done a great job. Danaher has done a pretty good job. Kinder Morgan has done a good job. That was basically Richard Rainwaters strategy for years, buy a stock and agitate for change to get the multiple up. Once he was trading at a premium, go forth and aquire and arbitrage the difference between the multiples. On the flip side, there have been a lot companies that do dumb deals. It is really situationally dependent.

2016-02-28 18:35:05,"Yes and no. For the most part our short book is overvalued junk and mean reversion type trades. That being said, we do look for those that we feel have been less than honest with their accounting and/or just have poor business models relative to the competition. On average, I would say we generate 3-4% alpha on the short side each year. 

We used to have a decent size event drive team that did merger arb, but we shut them down in 2006. That was the year we cut a number of groups because we didn't feel like there was a lot of value there. Event Driven, Structured Credit, Energy, and everything illiquid. We wanted to move more towards liquid strategies and more of a long volatility type exposure for the portfolio. Reallocated money into our Quantitative trading and research, Systematic Global Macro and Long/Short equity teams. There are some good dudes out there that run Event Driven and Merger Arb teams, but for the most part I feel like merger arb doesn't provide a lot value. When you run a factor model on it, it is nothing more than selling puts on the S&amp;P 500.  "

2016-02-28 18:17:38,"We don't use Monte Carlo or WACC. I don't even think companies use WACC when making capital allocation decisions, to be honest. I am very skeptical when people show up with overly precise earnings models. I just want to be in the ballpark with my estimates. 

For the most part we are going to be long quality and value and short junk. Over the long haul, I know this will work. There are times however when the market rewards junk vs quality. In those instances, our performance lags and we reduce exposure. We try to avoid this by runnnig a balanced book with regards to our sector exposures, for instane during the most recent energy bubble we were long CLR and short CHK based on balance sheets and management,  but it doesn't always work out for us becasue sometimes investors want junk companies. 

For your position sizing, as an individual, I would say that if you aren't comfortale putting at least 5% in a name, don't do it. Stick to a small portfolio of 8-12 or 10-15 names. 

Our trading costs are de minimus due to our size and volume. Additionally we get a rebate from the exchanges because we utilize limit orders and are considered a liquidity provider. We trade daily because our price/value and thus the risk/reward changes daily. As that changes, our optimization would change. Honestly, it probably wouldn't make much of a difference if we only traded once a month or once a quarter, maybe a couple of basis points or so. From a volatlityly standpoint, it makes a noticable difference though. 

All our optimization process's are internally generated. There is some academic research our there on CDaR and CVaR. MSCI Barra is expensive, probably not worth it to you as an individual. "
2016-02-28 18:17:03,"Great thread. It seems like the names in your short book are ""expensive and lower quality"" to offset your longs. Are there any ""alpha"" shorts in the book? Maybe a fraud/fad business model that isn't used to manage net exposure that has more conviction behind the position (sizing). Also, does your fund do any merger arb?

Great thread.

2016-02-28 17:55:33,Is there a realistic transition from S&amp;T to a hedge fund on a PM track? I'm looking to working on a distressed or structured credit desk (or a structuring team) so I can get modeling experience but I'm not sure what the path forward is if I want to move into HFs.

2016-02-28 17:27:35,"Its spread pretty evenly now because we have a good team. I'm very transparent and everyone knows how much is in the pool to distribute. Early on, I was rewarding the hard workers and consistent earners and then replacing the guys who weren't going to cut it. Its very much a meritocracy now and even though I retain final say on the team, everyone has a voice on who we bring on board. I think we do a good job of screening for team oriented people, but compensation is always a tricky issue. Now that I get part of the partner pool, I am inclined to distribute more of our teams pool to the team. If someone where to step up and say they wanted my job or wanted to be a pm, then I would most likely give them shot with small chunck of our dough. See what they could do and let them grow into the position, so to speak. I've even considered letting each analyst run his own sub portfoio while keeping the allocation and risk management decisions at my level. I think we would struggle under that model though because I don't hire traders, I hire analyst and those are two very different skill sets. Right now with the way its set up, all they have to do is company and industry research. I take their info and build the portfolio. I take on that burden so they don't have to. Some of these guys, they don't want to trade.  "
2016-02-28 17:25:48,"Thanks, very interesting. Do you use Monte Carlo simulation to get the estimates of fair values? What distribution shapes do you typically use for the different valuation inputs (WACC, growth rate, etc)? In what situations does the model fail? Sorry for the specific questions, I'm not a professional and interested in building my own model for position sizing. Have you looked at the affect on your fund's returns if you reduced your transaction costs by optimizing much less frequently? Like monthly or quarterly? I'll look into MSCI Barra, do recommend any readings that discuss the type of portfolio optimization you do or are they all somewhat fund-specific?"
2016-02-28 17:12:17,"Yes, just be persisitent. Have some ideas you can intelligently discuss. Additionally, know the environment and be able to talk about the space in an intelligent manner. "
2016-02-28 17:07:58,"Not in my opinion. Of those I would prefer a math or econ, but thats just my preference. I was triple major in Political Science, Philosophy and Economics. 

Yeah, Michigan is good enough. You don't have to come from an Ivy League, but it helps. I've worked with guys who did their undergrad at Virginia, Texas, Clemson, Notre Dame, UCLA, etc... Not everyone is from Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Pennsylvania. "
2016-02-28 16:56:17,Any chance you could point me in the right direction?
2016-02-28 16:31:48,How do you think about your team's comp? Like do you give analysts a certain % of the pool or do you try to target an absolute number for compensation of your employees?
2016-02-28 16:12:55,"Do Engineering, CompSci, Econ, Finance, or math undergrad degrees not really make a difference then? 
And would a place like UMichigan be good enough?"
2016-02-28 15:13:27,"&gt; Doesn't happen. Its a different skill set. Sometimes execution traders will make the move to analyst, but thats group dependent. 

I thought so, could I PM you to ask a more detailed question?"
2016-02-28 15:13:23,Why do you use CDaR instead of CVaR? Do you calculate your own return probability distribution based on your valuation or do you use daily past returns as done conventionally with portfolio optimization?
2016-02-28 14:54:46,"How much does the prestige of your undergraduate degree matter for getting these jobs? Is it very hard to get a job as an analyst at a HF if you don't go to Wharton, Harvard, Yale Princeton, Columbia, MIT, Stanford, etc.?

Also do you look for people with specific degrees? Would you hire a computer science major as an analyst? Or do you look for econ/finance majors?"
2016-02-28 14:25:13,"Doesn't happen. Its a different skill set. Sometimes execution traders will make the move to analyst, but thats group dependent. "
2016-02-28 14:21:11,using mega?
2016-02-28 14:20:58,Thank you very much.
2016-02-28 14:19:22,What's your view on moving from the back office to the front office at your hedge fund?
2016-02-28 14:11:31,"We use a forecasted beta similar to how we forecast volatility. I, as the PM, don't forecast these, instead I load our long and short portfolio names into the ""flux capacitor"" along with our price/value estimates. Our Portfolio Management System then takes all the quant factors into consideration and spits out ""optimized"" portfolios. 

If I were doing the position sizing, I would simply weight the names according to price/value and someitmes I compare the two just to see what my discreationary portfolio would look like vs what we are actually running. Thats mainly for my benefit and curiosity. If there are large discrepancies I will investigate them, but they are usually very similar from a high level. "
2016-02-28 14:03:55,"We attempt to predict it with a vol forecast, but if our realized vol spikes we will make adjustments. "
2016-02-28 13:42:10,Thanks for the clarification. Does your firm use backward looking measures for volatility or tries to predict it (for the sake of maintaining constant volatility)? 
2016-02-28 13:32:34,Definitely share bro
2016-02-28 13:29:41,"Gotcha, sorry that was confusing.  I feel like once you introduce derivatives, shorting and leverage into a portfolio beta becomes useless. When evaluating long only its fine. A lot of ""hedge funds"" I feel are nothing more than leveraged beta. They are leverage and long some underlying index and provide no real value. 

Our main focus is on managing risk and targeting a specific volatility. You are seeing some of this bleed over into the long only world with some of the new ""constant volatility"" products that are coming out. We utilize CDaR as our main constraint. In laymans terms we want to reduce the risk of drawdowns and as volatility spikes in our book, we reduce exposure to maintan a constant volatility. As we reduce our exposure, we are generally increasing expsoure in another area of the firm that. If the firm as a whole is spiking, we cut positions. We aren't going to hold onto losing positions just to maintain a volatility though and will go to cash in order to preserve capital and live to fight another day. 

I hope this helps???"
2016-02-28 13:17:54,"Its not that the info the program covers ins't valuable, its just that doing the valuation work we do is more analagous to that of investment banking. Wall Street Prep is the firm I used to recommend for their self study program, but its been a few years since I looked at it. For the most part I feel like the CFA is a marketing gimick.

Best bet as a sell side analyst is to put out good research. Talk to the brokers that cover the firms you want to specifically get in front of and make sure you communicate with them. If you do good work then they will want to put you in front of the managers to discuss your ideas. From there, you can work on developing a relationship with the managers and then leverage that. "
2016-02-28 13:14:25,"I ask because beta seems to be the foundation of how your firm measures performance and execute your strategies and it is something that you find useful (you talked about beta exposure, leveraged beta, etc. etc.). But then again you just said beta is garbage so I'm a bit confused. I was wondering if you can offer some remedies to the drawbacks. I find beta to be mostly, if not completely, useless for making investment decisions. 

I do agree with your risk analysis for the funds (from a very general perspective)."
2016-02-28 12:55:56,"I do, but all our quant guys are PhD's. Quant trading is really nothing more than academic research. Its a wonkish profession and nothing prepares you for that like a PhD and doing original research. The only difference between academia and quant trading is you generally don't publish your results for peer review. Thats like giving away the secret sauce. "
2016-02-28 12:33:45,"Book value is net assets (which is equal to total shareholder equity because assets - liabilities = equity, i.e. assets net of liabilities equal total equity). 

Treasury stock (i.e. stock a company has repurchased) is no longer 'outstanding' and hence increases EPS all else being equal.

Total shares outstanding may creep up over time due to stock options issued to employees that vest and are exercised, leading to new share issues throughout the year."
2016-02-28 12:30:42,"Atta boy, eats his own cooking and that says so much. "
2016-02-28 12:18:39,"I was a Politics, Philosophy, Econ major as an undergrad and got a position with the Financial Sponsors Group at a large investment bank. From there I went to B School and got an internship with my current firm, where I have been ever since. I hade offers for internships from a couple of investment banks and consulting firms. The PM I worked under went to the same undergrad, so I leveraged that and my experience in banking to get an interview. For some reason, he liked me and gave me an internship offer. At the end of the summer he made me an offer to come on board as analyst and the rest is history. At that time, people were either going banking, consulting or start ups. I didn't have as much competition for a spot. "
2016-02-28 12:16:06,"Thanks so much for the response!

That was what I was thinking too. I'd pursue an MS in Comp Sci over an MBA because I'm attracted to all that quant stuff. I'd consider an MFE as well but I've been hearing a lot about how the degree is oversaturated. 

A PhD is a pretty large time commitment. Do you think the advantage it gives over a Masters is worth it in this context?"
2016-02-28 12:13:44,"Thanks. More question about beta. Statistically speaking the betas derived from regression is garbage. R2 value is generally terrible. Yes there is ""smart beta"" but they generally fall into the same trap. They move with the market (i.e. 5-year beta could be 0.5 today and 0.7 next year) and also differ depending on the time horizon (1 year, 10 year, 3 months, etc.), furthermore, they can also differ depending on the interval chosen (week, year, month, day)."
2016-02-28 12:05:53,"I think there is an interview that's like ""if I was in business school I would start a tech startup instead of this"", pretty much confirming his commitment to investing lol. Yeah he's an egomaniac, but his crazy concentration blow up as well as the guy who runs brave warrior pretty much concretely decided that 20 is the most concentration I'll run with.

Yeah and despite it all he's richer than many people, his loud public face is definitely a good business practice. "
2016-02-28 11:49:33,Thanks for doing this; it's been very insightful.  I'd love to hear a little more about how you broke into the firm/industry in the first place.  You said you started right out of bschool--how did you get that first position? Were you from a target school or non-target? What type of experience did you have before bschool?
2016-02-28 11:48:51,"Yes, we have to borrow the shares from our prime broker. For the most part, we stay away from hard to borrow becasue the interest and potential for a short squeeze. 

Our commissions are cheap, we trade for less than a penny a share and becaue we use nothing but limit orders we get an exchage rebate to offset a lot of the costs. Retail commissions would be a killer. "
2016-02-28 11:45:44,"You are ahead of the curve, dude. The only reason I would go to grad school is if you want to. There are always risks in hedge funds, your AUM is most likely sunject to quarterly redemptions so you constantly face a run on the bank. You also risk a blow up which leaves you out of a job. 

I think quant is going to continue to dominate and if you have the desire and ability would encourage you to pursue a PhD in a math, science or comp sci field. "
2016-09-06 23:09:42,"Thanks for mentioning Howard Marks, I just downloaded the Masters in Business he is a guest on. Looking forward to it. Barry Ritholtz has a decent [blog](http://ritholtz.com) and has a good set of daily news links.

Ray Dalio is pretty elusive. The only way I can get insights from him are from interviews I dig up on youtube. He is frequently on the World Economic Forum and most of those interviews are on youtube, they just aren't that current. If you find out where to get his newsletter/memo, etc let me know. Thanks!

I wouldn't do it today though for various personal reasons."

2016-09-06 16:58:32,"I left quite unimpressed after reading this. It's all-out marketing, no substance. "
2016-09-06 16:43:26,"I've had positions on both the buy-side and sell-side. Both have their pros and cons, but if you are really interested in the work (i.e. you're not just in it for the money) both areas can be interesting. However, both sides of the business have their pressures. If I were starting over and didn't have a wife and kids to take care of, I'd enter the wealth management area. I used to think it was just a sales role and you would never do any of your own research, but the more I learn, you can set up your business however you want and manage the investments however you want, if you set it up correctly from the get go. On top of that, while your fee will be higher than an index fund, the value you provide your clients is substantial. Most people just don't have a clue about finances and can very easily get screwed. If you're honest and hardworking, it can be a very interesting and rewarding area."
2016-09-06 16:04:55,"I work in finance, but not securities analysis or anything similar. I switched courses basically twice. I found out late in my first degree (which I had switched to poli sci from architecture) that one of my passions was finance/econ/investing, and it was just too little, too late to change things, so I just ended up going back for a different degree. I realized even now with the advanced degree in finance that I could do everything I love now about investments and finance, not even being involved in the finance industry professionally. I could have stuck with the architecture degree and still done my investment projects on the side, and been perfectly happy, probably even more wealthy. 

Bottom line. If you have more than one passion besides finance and investments, and can do what you love in finance without making that your profession, I'd advise you to do the other. You can have the best of both worlds. In my case, I could be an architect and still an investor. But I couldn't be a finance professional and still be an architect. It just wouldn't work."

2016-09-06 15:46:08,"Yeah I don't know about the comparative value either. Also not going to do the analysis for it because yeah, on my lazy instinct scale, it's not cheap enough for me, nor do I think Zuck knows how to efficiently allocate capital yet. I'd rather own Google (which I do)."
2016-09-06 14:52:31,"&gt; You need to understand the industry (government spending) to understand whether the company's operating models makes sense or not.

I don't think you understand my point, or maybe I'm not getting it across the right way. I do understand this industry and have spent the past month working on this idea. What I'm saying is that I don't need to know the exact numerical figure of public spending for the next few years to become comfortable with this idea. 

This is a business that has grown earnings at a mid-single digit rate over the past two years (arguably their biggest years business wise) that the market is pricing for 35%+ earnings growth over the next two years. There's just no way. 

If you read my report you will see that their main earnings driver, the stun gun business, has been propped up by unsustainable price increases and even tiny variations in that pricing completely craters earnings. Is that not a bad business to you? 

Re: catalyst. I again disagree. Right now that market thinks TASR is the *only* player in the body camera market and can repeat the the monopoly they have on the stun gun market because their competitors are either 1) small and lesser followed, 2) private companies, or 3) obscure segments within larger tech companies. This lawsuit with Digital Ally that I point out is woefully underfollowed and when it becomes a well known issue (when it goes to trial) it will completely break the idea that TASR can continue uncontested in the body camera market, and that they will also be unable to create a monopoly on body cameras. This will happen by November/December. 

I disagree with your hedge point. It doesn't make sense for me to make an investment in a sub-par idea just to hedge something. See David Einhorn's comments on pair trades for further explanation of that idea. 

"
2016-09-06 14:35:56,"You need to understand the industry (government spending) to understand whether the company's operating models makes sense or not.

I wouldn't act on this idea though because the industry theme (mainly public sentiment; see Mylan as an example) against it is too strong, and you haven't found a strong enough catalyst for them to significantly lag the overall industry. Shorting is much better when you long something else to hedge it. An unhedged short should ideally be one where the product or operating model so obviously sucks so much that the emerging knowledge of its shittiness is the catalyst  (e.g. it's fraudulent). "
2016-09-06 13:58:37,"&gt; Why do you find it to a poor investment strategy?

I'm not smart enough to try and guess market tops and bottoms, and I have no special insight into why policy makers will make particular decisions, so I try to base my investment strategy off of a company's fundamentals and operating model. 

But like I said, when a situation (such as with TASR) is linked to what the government decides to do with their money, I can see what sort of expectations that market has priced into the stock and how their fundamentals react to it. 

That said, I think public safety spending will continue to be a thing, just not as much as everyone else thinks. This has two implications 1) TASR will not be able to continue price gouging on the stun gun side, and 2) increased body camera competition (where they have no competitive advantage) will not allow them to reach the critical mass necessary to achieve operating scale. 

I don't need to worry about whether certain bills are passed, or what spending looks like under a republican/democrat congress because when you get down to it federal spending is only part of the equation. There is also state and municipal spending. To try and figure out where each of the three are going would cause one to miss the forest for the trees and I don't think its an appropriate use of time when I can just figure out the overall trend (flat to modestly down). "

2016-09-05 23:05:30,"Yup, as long as the useful life of the asset is &gt;1 year it's definitionally capex. Perhaps 1 reason why accounting policies haven't caught up is that it may be beneficial in the short term for tech firms to generate low income statement profits (specifically pbt) to pay lower annual cash taxes. More likely/persuasive though is the uncertainty of future benefit argument. We often have no idea how successful the R&amp;D investment will be in driving new patents etc vs building a new factory.

2016-09-05 21:00:14,"Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0

The reason stocks are rallying in the absence of earnings growth is because we are in the deleveraging phase of the long-term debt cycle. This is where the excess credit in the system is reduced to match the actual level of productivity in the economy. 

The tools used by policymakers to close the gap are austerity/debt payoff and printing of money. The former is deflationary while the latter is inflationary. That's why the US dollar hasn't really seen much inflation despite the increased money supply, because the excess credit in the system is slowly being phased out in favor of actual money.

As more credit is reduced, more money is printed. This has the effect of keeping prices high despite the absence of productivity growth, because to market participants money and credit are the same thing. The goal of policymakers however is to reduce credit, not control prices, so there's a slight asymmetry of goals between the system and those within the system with regards to money supply policy. 

As a result, what you're seeing is prices being maintained at pre-deleveraging levels, while productivity slowly catches up, until the balance is restored. The end result, or at least the one policymakers hope for, is that i) credit is reduced to normal levels, ii) productivity has increased to match the increased money supply, and iii) money doesn't experience too much inflation. 

So if things play out the way they're expected to, we'll just see markets stagnate at artificially ""high"" levels, until real productivity growth catches up. "
2016-09-05 20:55:59,"tl;dr  mrkt is mispricing equity due to opacity around earnings power due to a cluster fuck of balance sheet activity around m&amp;a squared and timing of cap ex cycle that is peaking and depressing fcf.

Aw, I kind of felt bad for Zuck here. This guy like rips him apart (Zuck is no Bill Gates!!). Lol, like yeah, I do suspect FB is overvalued (not going to bet against it though like a moron). The WhatsApp deal was good though, in my opinion. Not sure about the Instagram deal; though I love using Instagram, I doubt they would be anywhere as massive as they are now without Facebook's being their umbrella organization; versus Facebook messenger noticeably improved post the WhatsApp deal. They just need to convert the WhatsApp people into Facebook or else put up some profitably enough advertising so that the users keep using WhatsApp.

I would definitely consider owning $FB at some point though, just not now, for sure.

I'm doubtful this is worse than the dot.com mania. Facebook isn't going away, at least anytime soon. That particular bubble is ""crystallizing."" 

Yeah he kind of has a printing press. Yeah he's probably going to burn a lot of money. I just kind of shrug at this part and don't have many opinions or feelings on it.

I still wish other stocks, assets like housing, and anything food related would deflate in price though to help redistribute wealth so the market is ""free-er.""

Hm, I'm not really sure what the last paragraph is trying to say either. Deflation has been happening, period. I don't attribute it to the more productive companies such as Amazon and Google, as the author seems to be claiming. 

I blame that they're aren't enough new things to reinvest capital into, which is a function of our educational system. Something like that. "

2016-09-05 14:01:41,"So the newest, popular companies are creating less jobs. I disagree with the conclusion/concluding line though.

Those other companies are maturing, this is a natural thing to happen in industries, while new companies are showing they are much more productive than the average existing company (a good thing).

I pin the blame on our existing education system, it hasn't enabled people with the skills that allow them to react to changing realities in the economy. Instead there's a lot of dumb focus on standardized tests, test taking, test prepping, grit, and just general pushing a dumb worker bee mentality due to our current retarded political system. There's also probably some minor issue with not enough small town banks helping fund new small businesses on Main Street due to onerous regulations mis-written for the banks too big to fail or something like that."

Netflix (NFLX), with 3,700 employees, has supplanted Blockbuster, which once employed 60,000.

3. patents, time, he only needs a range of numbers, doesn't need 432 million 298k and 192 dollars 25 cents, 300-500M is enough
4. let me google that for you
5. bad companies needs to reinvest in order to maintain, better companies reinvest for growth, even better growth without investment. for example, if coca cola needs to spend 10B -&gt;additionally&lt; a year on ads in order to maintain its revenue, then obviously its worth a lot less today. Or a railroad company for example, if it needs to maintain tracks, or if a competitive sales company need to hire more sales. in summary, if the business is ultra competitive, and it's a bad business, though they make money, they would make less each year if significant investment is put back into the hole.

this guy is a little too much theory, i mean in reality you should be able to avoid traps as you see them for what they are. in the last question if you see a company that generate significant income, with no dividend, no acquisitions, etc etc, and no increase in ""real"" equity, then obviously something is wrong."

2016-09-05 10:06:48,"Re: real estate - The money has more to do with the Fannie/Freddie government interference (they artificially lower interest rates in a misguided attempt to increase home ownership rates and a bullshit version of the American Dream) along with the fact that most people are not entrepreneurs--most are working for others and their income depends on the employer in their locale. Those workers are indeed not often using their home as productive assets. It's not a bad thing. 

Yes, they take little risk because they can push it onto the taxpayer. However, again that's the government's problem; my point about that banks can be induced to make loans by using collateral (or track record, or market knowledge, but collateral is the best and real estate is one of the best types of collateral) to lend money responsibly holds true. It's also not that troubling if the majority of people use loans to finance homes; they do have to live somewhere, and getting a loan for it, allows one to move away at the beginning of their career rather than the end of it (would you rather live in a society where people live with their parents for ~30 years until they can finally afford to move out, or worse, a society where people can only move out if their family has enough generational wealth to support their own children while letting the poor have to settle for staying poor)? The other bullshit is how the government pretends houses are the a good place to store wealth for the middle class. No. Not at all. I can go into a rant about this, but I'd rather not for now because it's exhausting. 

Yes, I think you are correct about the exorbitant amounts of money going towards things that are not funding productive activities. Yellen seems aware of this, she is just not going to put it bluntly like that as the decent leader she is. Instead, she has been subtly pushing responsibility towards general policymakers. People are yelling at the Fed for causing the problem; but again, this isn't the appropriate place to direct blame. Our executive policymakers are the appropriate authority to be yelling at. The Fed is doing a good job with what they are tasked to do; they are managing monetary policy so that people are not mass starving or rioting in the US. 

The Fed is like the construction guys that are filling potholes on the highway. The roads are safe enough to drive on. But they are not responsible or have the toolkit to change the extreme traffic or weather conditions that are constantly causing those potholes. That's on our executive policymakers to think about and fix (and using this analogy, I don't think the optimal solution is to repave the road and/or encourage people to disperse to the suburbs and take public transportation back in at all, which is essentially what the analogous policies that many politicians back).

2016-09-04 05:43:56,"perhaps someone else could help out with the technicals (2+4)

1) Might be anecdotal, but I find that the funds with the best returns really do have an intense focus on a specific discipline of value investing. Whether that be finding net-nets, special situations, compounders or even certain geographies and markets. It's certainly not a disadvantage to be a generalist, but I do think it's an advantage to be specific to a certain strategy. See Curreen capital (spinoffs), Riskowitz capital (south african compounder focus, some 35%+ returns) and Denali capital (Malone feitsh dude, spinoffs and special situations)

2) well the whole premise of a DCF is assumptions on ""variables"" - assuming revenue growth, margin expansion/contraction etc etc. Obviously a lot can change in 5-10 years and you're essentially trying to forecast the future, as such, DCF's are really just assumptions based on changing variables and then discounting fcf to PV.

3) Just some thoughts here - why not use goodwill as well in ""reproduction costs""? That's certainly a factor as well as SG&amp;A and R&amp;D when trying to replicate a company. I'd also put weight on the cost of assets, especially if it's a capex heavy industry - what's the cost basis of a factory on the b.s etc.

5) I think you would be right regarding your logic for maintenance capex. But I believe that quote is referring to growth capex. Some industries, i.e low moat industries, think airlines - say one airline is experiencing high levels of passenger growth (winning market share), this has to be followed up with large growth capex in aircraft (the reinvestment in the business). I mean, its not really being given back to shareholders, right? Especially given the average airlines destroy invested capital. 

The best businesses are able to scale without constant reinvestment, i.e capital light compounders so as to return the free cash flow back to shareholders via buybacks, dividends, acquisitions etc etc. Perhaps someone can chime in and give a good example."

If, for some reason, sales were to drop next year, for 2 years or more, they might run into a problem, depending on their expenses related to growing the business. There is a lot of competition brewing from other car manufacturers in the electric car market that should be a cause for caution and concern.

2016-09-02 19:04:50,"Just a note

&gt;. In one recent quarterly earnings announcement, for example, Musk unveiled pro-forma figures that lowered Tesla’s official loss almost a quarter by eliminating “stock-based compensation expense” from total costs. As Warren Buffett argues, equity options and restricted shares are a real cost—and correctly treated as such under GAAP—because they cause dilution by shrinking the share of earnings that go to existing shareholders.

correct, but it doesn't hurt Tesla's cash flow. Surely it is a real cost when considering valuation, but when calculating whether the business is solvent or not it's quite irrelevant."

It's price is such that if you're buying it, you're expecting your margin of safety to materialize in the form of the company's growth. I wasn't saying the company is bad, nor did I say it wouldn't grow. Management has advised lower numbers next year, but the year after could be record breaking. I'm not saying this won't happen. I'm just saying that it's not clear this WILL happen, for many of the reasons I listed above. It's going to recede next year, then what? Plateau in year 2, recover to current NI levels in year 3, and start compounding after that? Or break records right away in year 2? Or it could go the other way, and NI will fall in year 2 AND 3. This isn't something like coca cola or Colgate where next years sales and NI will predictably be 2-3% higher than this year's.

Because it's future earnings growth are not easily visible/predictable, and there are significant headwinds that it faces on a variety of fronts, I don't think it's a good idea to use expected future growth as a margin of safety in this case.

Because this is an investment analysis, I don't think it's a good investment. If it was a business analysis, I would most definitely agree that this is a great business. But as Capt said, the price isn't right. And you make your money when you buy ;)

2014-01-19 15:14:18,"I looked into this a little more over the past day.  I found some complications in valuing BWEL

* farm land/ water go together in california.  You can't value the farmland, value the water and add them together.  Farmland without water in california is worthless desert.

* water rights come in different forms in california.  Boswell has rights to water from the state, from the federal central valley project, and to underground water beneath their farmland, wellwater.  The amount of state and federal water they get is set at some maximum. Depending on how much rain fell that year, they get a percentage of the maximum.  (Right now they are saying 5%, because california is in a drought.)

* Agriculture water sells for substantially less than residential/urban water.  Depending on the source of the water (state, federal, or underground) you may or may not be able to convert agriculture water to urban water."

2014-01-18 15:52:20,"J.G. Boswell Co, (BWEL on the pink sheets).  It currently has a market cap of under $1 billion.  They have  a small number of shareholders and are not required to file public financials.  The management is doing everything possible to NOT promote their stock, although it is easily purchased through a brokerage. [Here's how they handle shareholders](http://www.investorvillage.com/groups.asp?mb=16550&amp;mn=1893&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=12129854)

Boswell is known as the largest private farm owner in the world.  They grow cotton, hay, wheat. People who have attended the shareholder meetings say Boswell owns 150,000 acres of california farmland, which is carried on their books at acquisition cost ($100/acre in 1930).  Current value would be $5-$10k per acre.They also hold significant water rights, [which could be worth several billion dollars](http://moneymorning.com/2013/05/31/water-resources-dry-up-opportunities-arise/).  In addition, they own about 125,000 acres in australia where they grow cotton.

I have no clue how much debt they carry.

2014-01-18 12:24:42,"I have several.

The first two and maybe some of the third one I haven't done that much work on but I can give you a general overview.

Genworth Financial.(GNW) Insurance company that has gradually been on the rise back up to its tangible book value since the recession. Right now its market cap is $8 billion and it has $13.33 billion in tangible book value. So on a tangible book value basis you're getting $1 for 60 cents.  
GNW is also not losing money at all. It consistently has $800+ million in free cash flow a year. 

Next one is Symetra Financial. (SYA) Symetra is an insurance company and has a $2.32 billion dollar market cap with $3.01 billion tangible book value. Not that big of a deal on the tangible book value side ($1 for 77 cents) but SYA consistently has 900+ million dollars in cash from operating activities. 

One I know a little more about is MBIA. (MBI) MBIA stands for Municipal Bond Insurance Association. So, they obviously insure municipal bonds. MBIA got screwed over in the recession and everyone has hated it since. On a generally accepted accounting principals basis MBIA has $3.18 billion dollars in tangible book value and a $2.21 billion dollar market cap. So according to GAAP you're getting a $1 for 70 cents. Okay deal right? It gets better. MBIA insures municipal bonds. Historically speaking, the default rate for municipal bonds is so incredibly low. You can see here how low. http://i.imgur.com/Tf6exwq.png They currently have $2.5 billion in unearned premium revenue. This is money that they will receive if the bonds don't default. This is carried as a liability because they have to step in and pay bondholders if the city can't make its payments. And considering how low the default rate is we could VERY conservatively say that MBIA is set to have about $2.1billion dollars subtracted from their liabilities and put in their assets. So add $4.2 billion dollars to their tangible book value (Liabilities - 2.1B, Assets + 2.1B) and we get a tangible book value of $7.38 billion dollars. 2.2 billion dollars / 2.38 billion dollars is a dollar for a conservative 30 cents. It gets a bit better. MBIA settled a lawsuit on.. December 24th I think with ResCap and MBIA received 800 million dollars and their stock price literally did not move at all. (The previously mentioned $3.18 Billion in tangible book value is before that 800 million dollars added). If a bunch of cities decided that they didn't need insurance and MBIA wrote literally no new policies they would still receive that conservative $2.1. That's why I sort of don't care what their business is doing now because I am still receiving a ton of cash in the next couple years no matter what.

The last one is Sears. Yes I said it. Sears. I'm not going to explain the whole thing here but I wrote about it previously on /r/securityanalysis and here is the link if you haven't read it. http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1tfvlm/i_did_a_little_write_up_on_shld/

2014-01-18 12:16:21,I feel despite people assuming that it must be getting more stringent (it prob has comparatively) i do  always take every Chinese company with a pretty huge grain of salt..... 
2014-01-18 09:41:46,"Mandalay Resources (MND): Bought in around 5 P/E, posting record sales and NI (before OCI) despite gold being incredibly low. Pretty strong management who wants to grow organically. Guaranteed money in my opinion, and not in the very long term either.

Zuoan Fashion (ZA): Bought in at a hair under 1 P/E. This company is overall insanely undervalued as its books show $7 cash per share for a $1.80 price, no debt, strong growth potential, great ROE etc. Just amazing everything. Of course there's a catch: It's a Chinese company. The company scores a few ""legit"" points (do your research) but it's been very reticent to declaring a dividend despite holding massive levels of cash, which raises a red flag. It promised one in the next quarter (would rather see small regular dividends imo), but we'll see. All in all, for a coin flip at 100% loss or 1500%+ gain over 5 years, it's worth at least a small position.

2014-01-17 22:30:47,"I would argue that a huge part of security analysis (and investing in general) is grappling with the unknowable future.  Decisions under uncertainty open humans up to all sorts of cognitive biases that can cause us to make mistakes.  Value investing in particular recognizes the effect of emotions and behavioral biases on security prices and IMO is the greatest legal opportunity for enterprising investors to ""beat the market"" either through higher returns or through lower risk for the same return.

For me, it reinforced what matters when I am trying to understand what creates value, what destroys value, and what doesn't matter.  Penman preaches anchoring valuation on the reported financial statements, which also helps fight the tendency to justify lofty valuations with high growth rates. Only growth that earns returns above the firm's cost of capital is what matters.

2014-01-16 19:05:35,"I never contested any of this. The question is: what's the low hanging fruit for international farmers ? My point is that tractors might not be te first stop in hunt for farm yield. I agree it will be a stop, but if it's not for 10 years, that's important

This could be exacerbated by fragmentation of international farming, meaning inadequate sources of capital for big ticket items like tractors. I don't know much about this but it's another consideration...if you don't have a lot of capital, but want more yield, you'll buy the least capital intensive option--seeds

Potentially exacerbated by the forthcoming tightening of credit in eEM as US rates rise

Further exacerbated if financial ops doesn't operate outside the US..again, something to look into"

2014-01-15 12:13:40," note: everyone makes this point about how we need to more efficiently utilize farmland, especially internationally. But nobody ever says when this will happen. If pressure for highly mechanized units doesn't develop internationally for 10-20 years, is DE still a good company? And if that demand does materialize in a timely fashion, is DE the clear winner? AND, if they are, will they be able to win outsized returns on capital, considering they don't have a moat? It will take a lot of time and money to replicate their moat internationally, if replicating it is at all possible.

2014-01-15 12:10:32,"1) 49% vs 45% is not a magic number, just a trend with bad implications.

2) the more that DE exposes themself to credit risk, the bigger the impact of a nightmare scenario on the balance sheet. And, again, I have trouble imagining how you boost lending that much without sacrificing quality. The nightmare scenario has a bigger impact, and is more likely to occur. Whatever that means, if anything, it's not good.


3) I think your last paragraph about interest rates rising necessarily implying crop price appreciation is total hogwash. Too many confounding variables.

Side note: everyone makes this point about how we need to more efficiently utilize farmland, especially internationally. But nobody ever says when this will happen.

2014-01-15 11:30:11,"Yes next year should see revenue decreasing between 2-5%

I don't think the next years should be as strong as the last 2-3. 
"
2014-01-15 10:01:27,"Here is my answer to your points 

1. Like any equipement manufacturers they finance their products. CAT does it for all their machines it's just the way it goes. The loans have very low risk of defaulting because the balance sheets of the farms are great. I speak here mostly if the US since this is where DE makes most of their money. Check a comment I posted in here where I  linked a presentation from DE on the balance sheet of the farms( stats from the USDA) and you'll see that default isn't the concern you expect it to be. 

1. It is not a secret that Deere trucks are more expensive than the others specificaly the domestic brands in emerging markets. They might not have pricing power for the moment but their products are still much stronger than the competition. Once the farmers of the emerging markets start making more money and that the land becomes a problem they like Europe and the US will need more yield per acre than they are getting right now. Paying more for DE gear will make sense then.  MEanwhile Europe will come back in the next years so that will help.

1. The financial arm was making money pre 2008 they will be an adjustment period but Deere financial isn't a REIT so they aren't that leveraged 

1. This one is a bit more problematic but I don't think they are invested 100% in stocks. Now they have to own fixed income but right now I would much prefer them being underweighted in fixed income and overweight in equity. RAtes are so low they will only kill principal of fixed income in the coming years. STocks have more freedom to go up since they can price in rising interest rates. The best course of action would be private equity but pension funds are limited in the exposure they can take. 

The discount rate is shit you are right and companies are a bit scumbags for using such low and irrealistic rates. They pretty much all do it and follow the market in there by restating down the line. It's sketchy at best but I think DE can pay it. 

Maybe we'll see a switch from Defined benefit down to Defined contribution for new employees in the coming years. I know IBM redid their pension plan recently. 


All in all great points to bring up 


"
2014-01-15 08:58:14,"I take it you think Section 179 was significant? I guess will find out for sure in 3 months. I'm a bit skeptical because it didn't seem to drive capital spending in the un-recovered segments of the economy - but that's not inconsistent with pre-buying by those who had the money to do so. Do you have any numbers on how much pre-buying might have gone on?

I wonder if you had a similar reaction to me ... reading about this company and their products, I'm sort of falling in love with them. They make really cool stuff! At the very least, their website and marketing materials strike me as far better than Cat or Case.

2014-01-15 04:05:10,[deleted]
2014-01-14 19:26:23,"Yes, and it's a legitimate business model in many cases. Notice how I didn't say that they generated 2 billion in finance receivables...I said they generated 2 billion more than last year. Which is precisely the difference between 2012 and 2013 revenue. In Essence, they're borrowing from themselves to generate sales growth. That type of growth isn't sustainable, and I also wonder if it's feasible to maintain credit standards in the process (it might be, and they might have, and so this might not be as big of a problem). I think the reason they're doing this is to incentivize more buying activity in off peak season, which is working if you look at Q1-Q4 numbers y-o-y. They intimated this somewhere in the 10k. How long can they continue growing by borrowing from themselves, and does their risk profile change? If farmland is in a bubble, the increasing financing receivables could spell terrible fucking news, even if they have been maintaining credit standards. What happens when interest rates rise and farmland prices fall? 1) sales generated from own financing disappear, hurting equip ops and financial ops, a double whammy, and 2) increased level of receivable inventory means they have more skin in the game and more to lose when farmers start defaulting

 

Loans they made last year that are bad wouldn't show up as NPLs yet, me thinks. "
2014-01-14 19:13:12,"Gunna read into this, thanks a lot. Wasn't sure about a lot of the pension stuff, but from my preliminary learning it seemed quite aggressive. Will respond in time"
2014-01-14 17:15:07,"1) DE's asset allocation isn't unusual for pension plans. Personally, I'd be significantly more concerned about a plan that was overwhelmingly in bonds.

2) Funding obligations are based on discount rate, not expected return on plan assets. EROPA is used solely to calculate income, with the net actual return on plan assets going to comprehensive income, which then gets ... amortized into income over time, I think? I'm actually not clear on that part. I believe it's explained in FASB 87.

3) If you buy Deere, it's because of the $3B+/year they'll hopefully be earning selling tractors to farmers for many years to come. They also have $11B in investable assets, against an estimated liability of $16B ... clearly that's not the same thing as buying an ETF, the math doesn't come close. Nevertheless, the pension plan exists. You can get mad at it if you want to, but if you want to have a rational opinion on DE the stock, you need to assign some cost to the pension plan, with reasonable bounds for upside and downside risk, and continue from there.

4) Yes, I'm long in stocks right now. I think we were spoiled by the situation 3 years ago, when many if not most companies were clearly cheap on a quantitative basis, using conservative assumptions. But I think it's a perfectly fine time for finding great companies at reasonable prices. I think Deere might be one of them, but I'm not sure yet.

&gt; Also, how in the HELL do you assume 8.5% return with only a 4% discount rate? Explain that one to me

Well it's 7.8%, but either way, they aren't related to each other. Pension accounting requires you to use a discount rate based on ... well I'll let the FASB speak for themselves:

&gt;The objective of selecting assumed discount rates is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due.

But they aren't invested exclusively in high-quality debt instruments, so they will do better. I don't think 7.8% is unreasonable. I think many, many stocks will return that much at current prices."
2014-01-14 16:15:10,"Since lower funding obligations and pension costs mean higher earnings, and these costs depend on their stock holdings performance, their profit level is a function of their stock
Holdings performance, or of market return. If I want my investment to be a function of market return, I'll buy an ETF. By itself, it may not have a giant impact on earnings. But, in tandem with lower NIM at financial ops, lower ROIC in growth markets bc they have no moat in these markets, and sales growth increasingly financed by their own finance arm (which is unsustainable and exposes them to more credit risk, esp if they loosened lending standards), I don't know that DE is a clear buy.

Not sure if I read the part about financing receivables correctly, but I think they sold 2 billion more worth of financing receivables (related to equipment ops) to themself in 2013....you should look into this and let me know what you think"
2014-01-14 16:06:35,"Bonds, like normal pension plans. Right now, their pension costs are dependent on the performance of a risky asset class. They are in stocks bc it lowers their funding obligations, but they are taking risk to generate that reward. Considering the nature of pensions, ie; someone's life When they retire, I'd say they're taking outsized risk for the return they're getting (not because the nature of the risk is outsized, but bc the nature of the effect of the risk is outsized...ie people not getting the pension that they were counting on when they retire). 

Essentially, costs are lower because they're investing in the stock market. But, at that point, they're betting on the performance of stocks....The reason I would buy Deere isn't because they're great stock pickers, or bc of the expected return of the market. But that's essentially what you're buying when you buy a company with a pension plan like this. You're betting on 1)the market and 2) the savvy of DEs pension fund managers. I have nothing to say about #2, but for #1, go long on an ETF...in principle it's the same damn thing. As a value investor, would you be long right now? Lots of the best value managers are moving into cash--they don't think they can make good investments in today's markets. Do you think this pension can perform better? 

Even 50% allocation is way too much for a pension plan. They could be in for a sticky situation when markets turn south, which could have the double effect of forcing them to revise LT assumptions that go into the PBO calc

And this is a defined benefit plan--if their stock investments don't pay off, they're on the hook 100%.

Also, how in the HELL do you assume 8.5% return with only a 4% discount rate? Explain that one to me"

2014-01-13 05:57:30,"The main thing is that this is a ""daily"" ETF, meaning that it seeks to match the activity (but in the inverse) of the 20 yr bond. In other words, the managers of the etf basically go home flat each night, and put the short back on in the morning.  So this is a more useful tool if you think that the 20 yr will go down in the very near term, because the math that goes along with it is more akin to compounding daily vs monthly. For examply, if the benchmark (20 yr bond here) were to go down say 3% over a month, the etf would likely not be up 3% due to compounding (not to mention transaction costs).

If you're more of a long term bear, you could short the bond outright. However, if you short the bond outright you will be responsible for paying any and all coupons for as long as you are short."

The answer is no, because even if it breaks even, keeping $1000 today is worth more than having the full $1000 returned 10 years from now.

DCF helps measure how much those individual yearly payments would need to be to break even:  How much the payment stream is worth as an equivalent today.  Since you could put that $1000 in a risk free investment (say GIC or government bonds) for 10 years, you can use that interest rate to discount the future payment streams.  ie.  $100 next year is worth $98 today @ 2% interest rate."

2014-01-11 16:57:22,"The comment posted are talking more about present value mechanics and less so about the objective of discounted cash flow analysis.

A DCF requires 2 things:

1. An accurate forecast of cash flows from an asset (say, for example, the rent collected on an apartment building investment)

2. An accurate estimate of the opportunity cost of capital (sticking with the same example as 1. the rent collected off other apartment buildings adjusting for all the risks of owning a different apartment building than you invested in I.e. Tenant defaults) 

The objective of the DCF is to analyze the relative opportunity of your investment to all other potential investments you could make.  The value gained is therefore realized when you have accurately analyzed these two requirements such that you can allocate your money towards the best possible return while taking into account the risks.

This analysis is particularly helpful with stocks since the frictional costs of buying one stock over another are practically zero. To compare one stock investment to another, DCFs are therefore helpful.  

P/E multiples (and all other multiples) are simply quick ways of doing DCFs. However, the exercise of completing a cash flow forecast and cost of capital analysis allows you to test the assumptions being made by investors and critically analyzing them by doing your own research.

2014-01-11 12:06:10,"With the caveats that I'm self-taught at this stuff, and pension accounting is complex, here's my take on it. Looking forward to others' insights.

The first hint at overall magnitude is on the balance sheet liabilities (pg. 36), line item ""Retirement benefits and other liabilities."" At 10/31/2013, this was $5.4 billion. That means that they'd have to add $5.4 billion to their underfunded retirement plans just to get to the point where plan assets equal the present-value of projected benefit obligations (assuming not very much is ""other""). You can net out the $0.5B of ""Retirement Benefits"" listed under assets, implying that some plans are overfunded. You'll also see in the Statement of Consolidated Income (pg. 35) the line item ""Retirement Benefits Adjustment,"" which was $1.95B in FY2013.

With a market cap of $33B and Net Income of $3.5B, these aren't small numbers. So let's look at some details.

Move to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7: ""Pension and other post-retirement benefits"" running pp. 42-47. A good starting point is the table found at the bottom of page 43, with the headline ""The benefit plan obligations, funded status and the assumptions related to the obligations at October 31 in millions of dollars follow:"" Here you can see projected obligation, broken out between pension and health/life insurance, as well as plan assets with a similar split. So we see the overall magnitude of the plans: $12.2B in plan assets, and $16.9B in projected obligations. Note that at year end, *all* of the deficit was on the health/life insurance side of the ledger. 

Services costs were $330m - i.e., that's how much additional obligation they incurred from an extra year of employers working and incurring benefits. I note that it's disproportionately weighted toward pension plans ... this might mean that they are scaling back post-retirement health plans, and their obligations are primarily residual? I'd consider that good news if true, but haven't found info to confirm.

Actuarial gain in 2013 of $2B (!) - that's simply because assumptions about the future changed from 2012. So that gives you a sense of how far off these predictions might be from reality. The change in 2013 appears to have been primarily driven by health care cost assumptions, with the damning(?) line: ""An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $717 million."" Current assumptions are 6.5% short-term annual cost increase, slowly declining to 5% per-year annual cost increases. In other words, a guess.

To make the bull case, with a not-unreasonable expected return on plan assets of 7.8%, well in excess of the discount rate of 4.5%, they can and should make up some ground (this gets recorded in the income statement, as expected return on plan assets net of interest cost, which came to $168m in 2013). The optimist in me wants to believe that healthcare costs will not increase at the rate they predict. But it would be foolish to pretend it can't happen.

How should we take these numbers to update earnings, return on equity, etc.? That's not a rhetorical question. I'm really not sure what the takeaway is, besides that while the numbers don't terrify me - these plans, with $1B/year in benefit payouts for the foreseeable future, won't bankrupt Deere anytime soon - it certainly would be better for shareholders if the plans didn't exist in the first place.

"
2014-01-11 10:46:36,"At first pass at the article, I wonder if that book value of equity is a realistic number. For an eroding company the book value can stay inflated if the company never takes a write down. 

Einhorn did a good job pointing issues in the book value of real estate at St. Joe, and that company didn't outperform the market. 

Also if theres goodwill, then basically all this company has to do to pass a goodwill impairment test is to be a living and breathing company. So with no write downs of goodwill, means inflated book equity. 

While its good that the CEO own +70% of the stock, but does that mean that that CEO is afraid to look bad and manipulate the books to avoid wealth decline? Or is he on the same side of investors?"

2014-01-11 04:41:22,"P*r = e

P = Price
r = rate of return (%)
e = earnings

Basically, what we have here is a basic obvious formula. If you bought a machine for $100 last year, and you made $20 from it in one year, we can say that the rate of return is 20%. Similarly, if $400 and earned $80, r is the same.

In valuing whether to buy an item or not, we often use this formula. Let's say you want to buy a fridge. The fridge costs $300 (P1), but the amount you save from being able to buy in bulk one month in advance nets you $50 per week (e). So in 2 months, you would have saved $400 (P₂). Therefore, since P₂&gt;P1, the rate of return is satisfactory.

Now in valuing a stock, you want to do the same. However, predicting a company's future e's accurately requires some finesse. So one day an enterprising analyst reverse-engineered the formula and said, if we can get some kind of prediction on the r, we can switch the formula around based on the current e's, like this: 

P*r = e

P = e / r


Basically, calculating it's current price based on it's future r's and future e's. Like the fridge example above. 

It all seems well and good on paper, until you realize that future r's and e's are impossible to determine accurately. A company has so many moving parts, and therefore so many factors come into play. Macroeconomic, microeconomic, potentials, catastrophes... everything is being squeezed into one formula. Not to mention that each individual component which makes up 'e' can have its own set of rules and uncertainties. So when making guesses, analysts like to make a range of r's as a shortcut of accommodating all the possible e's. Which, as we've seen with the 2008 crisis or Japanese tsunami, does not act as a sufficient margin of error.

So does the DCF work? In my humble opinion, no. I have yet to find someone who can satisfactorily justify its use to me, and I am actually hoping someone can prove me wrong. What Warren did in his younger days, (and I believe even now) is to look at the company's current resources and see whether it can realistically achieve a satisfactory expected 'r'. If it can, he does it; if it can't, he doesn't; like the fridge. I always get stumped when I see the calculations which try to simulate his past investment decisions, because they never satisfactorily account for many factors. A sufficient margin of error is useful to mitigate the effects, but as we've seen with Geico, Warren doesn't really care about margin of error. It's just something we use because we don't have anything better, like CAPM for risk, I suppose.

2013-07-16 23:35:48,"You mentioned prostatectomies, and it's my impression that this makes a decent chunk of the DVSS segment, although maybe this was just initially important. The following $0.02 hinges on that assumption, so forgive me if that is not entirely accurate. 

Right now there is a huge over-treatment of prostate cancer because there is no good diagnostic test to determine the strength of the cancer, essentially if it is slow or if it's fast. More often than not (don't know the exact %), it's a slow grower, but determining this is not feasible atm. I don't have the study in front of me, but I've read that the complications that arise from this over-treatment out-weigh the benefits, but that most patients prefer to directly treat it than to take a monitor-and-wait approach. It's not outside the realm of possibility that personalized, genomic testing improves to the point of seriously correcting this over-treatment, which would presumably be an unpleasant headwind for DVSS. There is also the fact that there is greater reimbursement to be had in an extended, monitored approach (although robotic surgeries maintain higher reimbursement rates when compared to their traditional counter-part, as I understand it). "
2013-07-16 11:47:26,"Here are the assumptions I'm making:

1. US DVSS sales will continue to fall due to decreased hospital capital spending.

2. International DVSS sales will continue to grow as penetration in those markets is very low.

3. DVSS procedure share will continue to grow (and thus IA sales will continue to grow) as doctors that currently use the system will continue to do so and medical school students will continue to be trained on the DVSS. Combine those factors with secular population trends and you'll continue to see procedure growth.

4. At some time within the next year, revenue growth will be driven by International DVSS sales and IA sales rather than by US DVSS sales.

The investment thesis hinges most closely on assumption #1. I don't know how severe the drop in US DVSS sales will be or how long it will continue. I think the sales will normalize at a new lower growth rate. If that occurs, then the stock should start rising again once YOY comparisons are easier in 2014. I could speak with some hospital directors, surgeons, and medical school students to see how they think about the situation.

Either way, the time to buy ISRG is not right now. You'll see how everything plays out over the next 2-3 quarters.

2013-07-12 22:55:55,"I think the main problem with asking people on this thread about TSLA valuation is that TSLA is currently better classified as a growth stock, where much of the value is believed to derive from very high growth in revenue and earnings in the future that would justify a very high price for the company you're paying for right this moment. My guess is that very few members of this subreddit have experience or the required technological know-how for them to be comfortable investing in this company in the first place.

Like most others on this site, I know almost nothing about technology companies on the edge of development like TSLA and I think that whatever specifics I predict about TSLA's stock or earnings performance in the future based on current forecasts will probably be wrong. TSLA's market cap is about $15B at the moment, and my guess is that investors will want the company to become at least as large as Toyota is right now, which would be about a 1300% return. I think that's a good ceiling, maybe double that if people are lucky. But how likely is that?

With that all in mind, one of TSLA's benefits is that it's a first-mover. Although TSLA has a first-mover advantage, that hasn't stopped companies in other industries from eating each others' lunches over the history of business.  Technology, brands, and products can be replicated, improved upon, or just plain stolen by a more cutthroat competition. Ironically, TSLA itself is named after a guy who got the short end of the stick from Thomas Edison, and Edison's company (General Electric) is still one of the largest companies in the world right now. There are several massive competitors in the car market that TSLA will have to hold off or utterly demolish in the coming years in order to grow into a leading car company with an established worldwide brand, and I don't think the other car companies will play nice.

What makes TSLA especially scary to me as an investment is that even if TSLA's 10 year plan, or whatever it is, goes off without a hitch and it becomes an industrial giant like the other car companies, it's STILL a car company. This makes super-TSLA a cyclical stock like all the other car companies. A cyclical company depends heavily on how the current economic cycle is doing for its margins, product demand, profits, and growth. Each of these factors can move wildly over the course of 5-10 years. Thus, a cyclical company's valuation problem is compounded by the need to keep quarterly/monthly watch of the macro economy to make sure the cycle doesn't make a surprising turn. As a cyclical stock investor, you need to sell before the majority of shareholders realize a bust in the cycle is going to happen and you're left holding the bag. For me, the amount of speculative game theory required to play this kind of earnings game is enough to make my head spin. But if you really want to play ""the growth-and-cyclical-stock-trading-musical-chairs-game,"" a great reference on cyclical and growth stocks is Peter Lynch's ""One Up on Wall Street"".

Thus, I don't really value TSLA to be more than the $15B it's currently trading at. The risks and uncertainty in a long-term or short-term investment are large enough to discount the value of TSLA's predicted future cash flows to less than $15B."

The other point that no one seems to mention is competition. There are several other manufacturers that have deep pockets and can enter the electric car business. Now the common response would be that Tesla has first mover advantage. But does that really matter in a few years? There's nothing so complicated that Toyota et al can't make (electric motors have been around forever, car frame and other components are similar to existing, etc). Not that Tesla won't sell cars, but the others will too. So it won't be a slam dunk for Tesla, which most would say they need to justify this price. "

They can do the other stuff eazy. That coupled with the fact that I don't see competition anywhere near Tesla gives me the impression that Tesla is still a great buy even at its current price..."
2013-07-12 17:29:42,"Let me start by saying that TSLA is well past the ceiling of a rational assessment of fair value. I know I won't get as detailed as you want because psychology not fundamentals is driving the current stock price. 

When valuing a stock I always start by answering the question, ""Is it cheap?"". The answer to this question is a resounding no when looking at TSLA. Analyst EPS estimates for this year are negative and TSLA is trading for 8x 2013 revenue. For 2014, TSLA is trading at 150x EPS. These are multiples for early stage tech startups that distribute product through the internet and aren't touting building 400 units per week. The type of startups that can expand their user base by millions in a month.

At this point in time, I'd stop examining the stock and look somewhere else for bargains, but I'll go a bit further. You want to invest in securities where negative sentiment is working in your favor to make people ignore great fundamentals.

It's always helpful to run thought experiments and examine unit economics to judge whether expectations priced into the stock are rational. As a though experiment, look at Fiat. They own Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Ferarri, Maserati, and also sell agricultural vehicles and other things. They sold 4.2M vehicles last year and their market cap is $9.3B. TSLA will sell 20-25k vehicles this year and their market cap is $15B. Does that make sense? It doesn't.

What this discrepancy means is that the future expectations for TSLA are absurdly high. They not only have to kill it with the model S, but also with their hatchback that is supposed to come out next year, and get massive adoption with their mass market vehicle that is 3-4 years away. In order for this to happen, they have to increase capacity at their plant, build out a network for recharging their vehicles, and greatly eat into the marketshare of GM, Toyota, Ford, BMW, Audi, Mercedes Benz, and other car makers.

I'm not saying that this can't happen, I'm saying that's what's already priced in. TSLA has to do better than that for you to see a return on your money. Now Elon Musk is way smarter than me, and a better entrepreneur than me, but if any of those milestones slip, the stock will take a nasty hit. I'm not going to bet my money on a situation where abnormal outperformance in priced into the stock 5+ years in the future. I don't think you should either.

2013-07-12 11:01:42,"ISRG has the potential to be a uniquely special situation in 1-2 quarters depeding on how things develop. Briefly, here's how I view the situation:

da Vinci Surgical System (DVSS) unit sales decreases in the US alone are the reason for this revenue miss. While robot unit sales fell 27% in the US when comparing YOY quarters, international robot sales were up 100%.

ISRG has 2 revenue streams: DVSS Sales and Instrument/Accessory (IA) Sales. This year is the first year that IA revenue will exceed DVSS revenue. IA revenue grew 18% when comparing quarters YOY, but that wasn't enough to meet expectations.

ISRG has a huge moat. Surgeons aren't usually quick to change how they perform procedures. However, the DVSS occupied a place in the consumer's mind where the shiny new tech was better (Research shows that the DVSS not only isn't better, but is more expensive than traditional laparoscopic procedures). The end consumers actively sought out hospitals/doctors that performed surgeries with the DVSS (prostatectomies initially). Doctors that could use the DVSS made more money. Hospital directors were afraid of losing share of procedures in their cities, thus an arms race was created. I remember reading this article years ago:

http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2007/02/da-vinci-uncoded-or-surgical-robots.html

Now, the DVSS has an absurd share of urological and gynecological surgeries in the US. ISRG are continually adding to the list of surgeries this machine can be used for and trying to get doctors to increase robot utilization. This prevents other surgical robots from taking hold in niches that could eventually be used to attack other surgical markets.  Additionally, ISRG has these robots in all of the top tier medical school hospitals where the next generation surgeons are trained. Once they've gotten used to using these robots, getting them to go back to laparascopes is going to be difficult to say the least.

Here's what I hope to happens. Hopefully, US robot sales completely shits the bed and international DVSS sales and IA sales continue to chug along. Eventually, the stock price will hit a point where price implied expectations don't reflect the growth in international robot sales and instrument/accessory sales (The market tends to look at sales in aggregate instead of looking at different business lines). If this happens it will occur in the 2 quarters. Then in 2014, the stock will appreciate do to easier YOY comparisons and the US DVSS sales normalizing at a new lower rate. The stock will be driven by international uptake of DVSS systems in the future.

I've put a reminder in my calendar to check back up on this stock in November. It's like IRBT all over again. Until then, ISRG is on my watch list. If they turn this around faster than this I'll miss the boat.

2013-07-11 22:00:36,excellent.
2013-07-11 10:34:54,"First, let me point out that I do no do this for a living.  There are a lot of intelligent people on this sub who have a far better understanding of this stuff.  That being said...

I think if you understand the basic business model of mREITs than you start to see why falling bond prices affect them so much.  This can probably be more intelligently described so I defer to those who likely no a lot more on this sub.

Their business plan is to take cash then buy mortgages from Freddie and Fannie.  This is significant because these mortgages are ""backed"" by the US government making them higher quality mortgages.  They then use these mortgages as assets to take out short term loans at low short term interest rates.  They use the proceeds of these short term loans to buy more long term mortgages...essentially leveraging their position.  They are then making money in the difference between their short term borrowing costs and the rate of return on the mortgages.  

Over the past couple of years they have been in an interesting position.  Short term yields have been very low which has made their cost basis very low.  At the same time, however, mortgage yields were going down as the Fed kept buying up mortgages to keep rates low.  This presumably lowered the revenue stream.  While the fed purchasing was a bad thing in part because it lowered mortgage yields, I THINK (still trying to understand all of this)... I THINK the Fed buying was also, in part, a good thing for them because it raised the asset value of the mortgages they had on their books so in turn they could borrow more money and leverage themselves to make more money.  Think of it this way, they essentially bought a house with cash, then took out a mortgages on that house, and bought another house, and then the price of both of their houses was going up because everyone was buying houses, so they could take out bigger mortgages to buy more houses...and on and on.

Now, kind of like with the housing crash ruining the purchasing power of the common homeowner who used their house as collateral, NLY has issues because the Fed has said they will start selling these mortgages.  So the assets they have been using to leverage themselves is decreasing.  In the short term, they need to make sure they have sufficient collateral.  Remember that they get their cash to buy mortgages using short term loans. This means that they are constantly having to take out new loans...they are constantly having to re-up their collateral.  Their problem is that every time they go back to get a new short term loan, their collateral (the long term loan mortgages) is not worth as much.  They have to either come up with more collateral or take out less short term loans.  This is a, potentially, a BIG problem for their business model.

Herein is, what I THINK, is the short term problem for NLY.  Their assets are decreasing in value rapidly, thus decreasing the ""book"" value of the business.  Additionally, they can't continue to buy mortgages (their revenue stream) because they dont have the cash/assets to do it.  Thus their revenues will either remain stagnant or decrease.  They are stuck, in the short term.  They cant but new mortgages with higher rates.  So they have to wait until their existing mortgages get paid off so that they can use the proceeds from those mortgages to start buy new higher yielding mortgages.  Eventually, so long as they dont get squeezed to hard,  they will be fine and be able to buy newer higher yielding mortgages.

The question is...will they make it?  And if they do, how much will this squeeze shrink their purchasing power and thus their profit making power?

So to answer your questions:

1) It is difficult to know when to buy because it is difficult to determine the book value of the company.  Rarely is a company's book value as volatile as this.  So if you are trying to buy at a discount to book value, you may buy at a discout today, however two weeks from now, you may have paid a premium because the asset values of the company's balance sheet are devaluing at such a high rate.

2) Short term rates are the costs of mREITs.  Long term rates are the revenues of mREITS.  The steeper the curve, the better.  HOWEVER, you can not forget the fact that these companies are do leveraged.  If you look at the earnings call from this past quarter for NLY, you will see that the CEO says NLY has enough spare equity that they can absorb the decreasing asset values (so as not to cause them to deleverage themselves out of profitability.)  Rather, the CEO says that these situations are ideal for NLY because their costs (short term yields) remain low while revenues are increasing (long term yields.)

At the end of the day, I am not smart enough to know whether their equity is sufficient or not so I am waiting until the next earnings release August 1."

Doctor/Patient relationships are being addressed regardless of what technology is being brought into the folder, but the understanding with these new technologies like robotic arms is that you can now be in a hospital with no expert in, say, neurology, and still get a world renouned neurologist to do your surgery.

That to me is the future."
2013-07-11 03:32:58,"You clearly know your stuff here. I've been looking at AGNC for a couple weeks considering a buy given the serious discount to book and attractive dividend yield (although it seems prudent to expect that dividend to fall). A couple questions:

1) Would you tell me why NOT to buy?

2013-07-11 01:24:30,"I'm not an expert on this equity, but how do you justify the cost/benefit of a machine like this when the entire HC/hospital landscape is being forced to recapitulate the doctor-patient relationship from the ground up? It seems like even hospitals that *might* be interested in this device have a million other things to worry about first."
2013-07-10 23:03:41,"One thing that stands out to me in the article is where it says:

&gt;Investors have been overcompensating in selling REIT stocks while preparing for bond prices to fall further, according to Steven Delaney, an analyst in Atlanta at JMP Securities LLC. That’s increased the discounts to net values of REIT holdings, or book values, at which the shares trade.

&gt;On July 5, companies that invest in only government-backed bonds were trading at 88 percent of current book values on average, he said. Whether to buy the shares depends mainly on the direction of mortgage-bond prices, which may be set for new sharp moves with Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke speaking today in Boston, he said.

That last sentence is the most important.  The book values in the quarterly reports are so irrelevant at this point.  Even if you did calculate a new book value today, the mortgage market's extreme volatility renders such a calculation irrelevant within a few days.  

As for the valuation and negative sentiment, I have no doubt that these REITS have the potential to be over sold.  Likely, many investors were chasing the huge yields of mREITs and bought them up in the otherwise low yield equity/bond markets.  Then the Fed comments were made in May and the company was likely sold by institutional investors due to the confirmed imminent uncertainty of mREITS profitability.  Individual investors likely piled on as they became afraid of a plummeting share price. This mentality of the market could, or has already, created excessive downward pressure.  That's what we like to see.

Another issue, quasi-related to the article, is the comments made by NLY's CEO in the last earnings call.  In hindsight they seem overly optimistic that the Fed would continue buying mortgage securities.  This is the last part of the [call transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1393891-annaly-capital-management-s-ceo-discusses-q1-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=4&amp;p=qanda&amp;l=last) where the CEO seems to think, well in his words he hopes, that the Fed will not change it course until unemployment reaches 6.4%.  He also seems to be banking on the Fed's inability to make an exit.  

The CEO is asked about how NLY's portfolio is positioned to absorb the Fed's exit.  He points out that they have been raising equity in anticipation of the exit creating opportunities.  The question at this point is whether that equity is enough to absorb the Fed's exit.

Whether he is correct or not, we shall see.  New earnings come out August 1.  

Clearly there is a value opportunity that is being created.  The valuation issue is the immense amount of leverage and that leverage's effect on book value.  As value investors, we are used to book value being a rather stagnant number.  This is clearly not the case here.

I would be interested in your thoughts if you have been paying attention to this area.  I am a lay person (non-professional) investor, so I am sure my analysis is flawed.  I'm interested in your critiques."

This is my current reasoning about the project. 

I focus on quality of information - primary sourcing or direct reports avoiding blog reportage or secondary/tertiary  reporting or self posts or tirades and most politics .

The hub is currently a collection of great but diverse information which needs focus. This should come as the community expands. People will find useful articles in the hub from one smaller sub and cross-pollinate into other appropriate subs. I estimate effects will be seen once the sub hits &gt;500 subscribers. At about this subscriber level there should also be a better ranking of the articles.

Secondly the sidebar provides a shortcut to quickly find small interesting  communities. This is what originally drew me in to this project - I wanted to clear my sidebar and provide an easy to reference list of the various business subs.

Thirdly if you are subscribed to this sub and /r/business etc. an article appearing in both subs has greater weight on your front page. Subscribing is a round about way of giving a greater weight to longer articles in the subs to which you currently subscribe.

Also and this is a personal point; At certain times I want to just read some interesting  business articles, not necessarily in my line of work, and I don't want to have to go looking to find them amidst blogs or wade through politics or slanted reads.

2013-07-10 13:20:55,"Not sure how many bites you're going to get out of this sub idea.  With the exception of news related postings, the articles and analysis in this sub are pretty solid.  

Also, I agree with /u/logic_card that you have no focus to your sub.  General business is not really a focus on which you can post in depth articles that will save people time.  If you take this sub as an example, it is focused pretty strongly on security analysis from a value investing standpoint.  As a result, there are not a large amount of posts a day (easy to keep up with).  Furthermore, because of the specific focus of the sub, there is more in depth analysis.  

Please dont take my criticism personally.  I do see value in creating a sub that is essentially a more serious version of /r/business.  I guess I am just saying that it may be hard to really get in depth analysis in a sub that is so broad.  My thoughts, in short, are that the more focused the sub...the more focused (and in depth) the posting.

2013-07-10 01:19:11,"Honestly, too many people do not grasp the fundamentals to these things as well as they should. In addition, too many people try to make these things more complicated than they need to be. You build a complex beast of a model when you are well past the initial talks and want something robust. If you build a beast of a model too soon, then you've probably built in too many assumptions and don't have enough information to price them exactly (plus they ""correct"" assumptions will be slightly wrong anyway), so it's useless. 

If I were you, I would find a simple but sufficiently detailed LBO template and learn how to make it  yourself. Just do it over and over again until you can make it from scratch in 30 minutes. Maybe I'm wrong and you can already do this, but I'm usually surprised by how many people can't, particularly when it comes to junior bankers and junior PE associates. 

Generally, once you can do this inside and out, and then you also understand a given company in question inside and out, then it's kind of just logical to build the rest of the model to company and context. Learning on the job for these multitude of iterations is probably going to better than trying to learn how to build a master LBO model for every single type of company in every single type of industry.

From 2009 to mid 2011 the general trend was around $300 a year. During this upward trend localized peaks were rarely lower than the last localized peak, when they were lower this signaled a temporary period of stagnancy. The trend was broken in August 2011 when gold had risen more than $300 in around a month, far more extreme than any previous rise, it then dropped from ~$1900 to $1600 and the next 2 peaks only reached ~1800. The ""mean"" price for August should have been around $1500, apparently 64% of Ron Paul's assets were in gold, had he followed this principle and sold when the price rose sharply and hit $1800 he would have saved himself from losing ~20% of his assets."

2015-02-12 15:12:10,"&gt; There's also the issue of winding down a company that has been an important part of the housing industry for around 80 years, having to replace Fannie seems like a nightmare of a process

This is what sticks for me more than anything. Reform makes much more sense than winding down the entities. The pre-existing infrastructure worked well enough to rebound quickly from an extreme tail event in the housing market. Higher capital requirements? Fine. But completely trashing the entities only to remake and rebrand some Fannie and Freddie 2.0 under another name seems extremely costly and pointless. Then there is the issue that the governments prerogative is supposedly to bring more ""private capital"" into the picture in order to spare the tax payers from risk - well it's private capital they would be screwing by winding down Fannie and Freddie. The same private capital they are trying to attract...

It's been interesting to see the housing market in the US seemingly lag all other economic indicators, and I wonder how much of this is tied to the current mortgage market and thus tied to Fannie and Freddie."
2015-02-12 15:11:51,"We're approaching 7 years since the 2008 meltdown. If they were going to be ""wound down,"" it would've at least started by now. They ain't going nowhere."
2015-02-12 14:48:28,"I also speculative position in the company. If Fannie was currently losing money and had cost the tax payers even more money we would be hearing plenty about it, feel good stories about bailed out companies aren't exactly popular. There's also plenty of legal entanglements and most people just don't care about illegal sweeps and takings of private property if it doesn't involve their own property.

It does set a pretty bad precedent if the government keeps the sweep going. There's also the issue of winding down a company that has been an important part of the housing industry for around 80 years, having to replace Fannie seems like a nightmare of a process. Judge Sweeney recently threw out the case to stay the discovery process which well help in getting more documents from the Treasury regarding what actually went down."

Obviously I'm biased, but I feel like GSE reform is integral to the US housing market and that guaranteeing loans is a natural monopoly due to the economies of scale in such a business. Albeit complex, I'm surprised this story doesn't get more media coverage seeing as Fannie and Freddie are now extremely profitable and have returned all of the bail out money to the treasury. I thought more people, especially anyone who invests in publicly traded companies, would be up in arms about the fact that the US Treasury is sweeping all of the profits from these entities that are still trading publicly. Scary precedent if it continues."

2015-02-10 19:09:29,Would you like to rephrase your meandering post into one coherent thought?
2015-02-10 18:36:20,"That's the thing though -- you have to evaluate the fund. The classic example is BRK because it's the most well-known, but really there are a large handful of people taught by Ben Graham who can consistently return 15% or more per annum (ben graham and warren buffet had a track record of 20% per annum, warren buffet has a speech where he mentions a handful of other people. it's the monkey coin flipping speech). Also, I personally feel that you'd have to go back to the 90s or earlier to get a real view of these. If you look since 01 or 02 of course its feasible to have better returns on growth funds, that doesn't really cover the full economic cycle. 

It's good that you're questioning the long term results and fees -- honestly I wouldn't expect a very large fund to be able to outperform by a significant margin unless it had buffet or his successors at the helm. Also take a look at SCHD, it's only been around since '11 so obviously we can't look in the past for it, but I think the criteria for selection allow a quality bias, so if you want to follow it in the future see if it outperforms the next bear market"

2015-02-10 09:40:41,"I am not saying time the market.  I am saying the opposite. I am saying that the funds that I looked at here were outpaced by S&amp;P total index when looking at a 10-20 year time horizon. My point about if you knew it was a bear market is that it is difficult to do, and if you somehow magically knew that a bear market was coming, which I would argue most people cannot know for sure as we saw in 2014 and 2013 with naysayers sitting out on huge gains, then the logical decision wouldn't be invest in a value fund that performs less bad than the whole index. 

Your point about buying a dollar for 80 cents is good. And I inderstand that is the value philosophy, but with the funds I looked at, which granted is not all of them listed here, I saw clear better returns from including the growth stocks from S&amp;P in a total index fund rather than a fund that a manager feels represents value. 

to be clear, I am not advocating timing the market in any way shape or form, just questioning the long term results from the value funds I had looked up e.g. Wintergreen.

It would be hard to argue that the analysts whose sole purpose was to evaluate the risk of mbs tranches weren't negligent when not even considering the possibility of a down turn in the real estate market. They only accounted for prepayment risk when applying a rating. You could say it would take a black swan event to cause real estate values to decline, but really? We really thought it was impossible for a market to decline in value? 

It wasn't negligent for the people whose purpose was to evaluate risk not to consider a down turn on their market ever to occur? I would say it was, and if we punish based on consequence rather than action, it makes sense that the hammer came down.

The other important thing is that most funds don't really have permanent capital in place so the spectre of redemptions is always hanging over them. If you're managing money from a particular pension and you're down 10% in year due to investing in Russia then some of your clients are going to be pulling their money. It's why only few big investors like Klarman can afford to get involved in places like Russia, he knows he won't have clients pulling their money out of the firm even after a down year or two.

I also wouldn't be surprised if some institutions like CalPERS have enough clout to tell anyone with their money not to get into some regions."

[Here](http://www.estimize.com/wmt) is wall-mart. that number on earnings is how much profit came from the revenue, divided by shares outstanding. look at the revenue. That means wallmart collected that much more per quarter, if you have acess to a balance sheet you can see the actual number for profits. Now, compare that to Amazons: http://www.estimize.com/amzn , This is a very old school way to replicate massive growth. They spend every penny they earn right back into the company, instead of saving. The Rockefellers did this in the late 1800s, famously telling their business partners and wives not to live lavishly. This helped them buy out many Oil wells that failed during the depression of the 1880s, and even removed their reliance from the banking system of getting loans for expansion (of course they had to be broken up by the government later, as they practically had a monopoly, but that is of other issue). Amazon wants to be big, and Amazon wants to be the leader of online purchases. They already lead, however the internet markets have been fickle in the past, and is still not a guarantee.  They want to be the Wal-Mart of online shopping."

The fact that bucket 3 goes to 0 securities doesn't bode well for the methodology.  

Why not show the performance of each score? 9 total.   Or create 3 buckets of 3?

2013-01-14 01:56:04,"Yeah, that's interesting how preferred markets work in Australia.  It would be very very interesting if Australia went through a recession within 1-2 years after funding for those companies did indeed dry up. Security Analysis may have parts that are  outdated, so it'd be interesting if Graham's observation that Preferred and Convertibles only come up near a recession/sector collapse due to general lack of funding still held weight.

What struck me with convertible debt is that it's great if you own it, but it's a huge annoyance if you only own stock in the company. In pretty much every case, the new bondholder gets ahead at the expense of the current shareholder. So I guess I wasn't very clear.

Looking at some scenarios:

If the company goes bankrupt, the stock is most likely worthless, but the bonds will be more likely to get some money back in time due to seniority over equity and preferred. Some money is better than none here.

If the stock price and dividend increases greatly beyond the return of the bond, The bondholders will convert their bonds and dilute the shareholders. Technically this might just balance out a share's value considering that the bonds no longer have to be paid, but that's probably too complex an issue for a single post.

If the stock just drops a lot without a credit event, the bondholder will probably keep his bonds and have a much smaller loss on his hands, considering that he also gets interest. Meanwhile the stockholders have to keep their loss and maybe dividends."
2013-01-14 01:27:54,"Australian here, our market is ""saturated"" by banks and other large institutions issuing hybrids/retail bonds, you name it. The reason being:

a - a lot cheaper way to borrow (they pay BBSW+ 3 to 4.5%, BBSW is the LIBOR alternative in Australia) - this works out to between 6-8%

b - a lot of capital available vs European or US markets which are rather dry, or available at 10-16%

Whilst ""technically"" pref/hybrids could be considered ""toxic"", the real underlying reason should be sought after. Some companies may be pulling debt out to take over other companies, or chase growth etc. Some may be restructuring some debt, etc. The interest rate generally gives you an indication of risk along side with demand."
2013-01-13 23:55:46,"Supposedly graham hated, (both?) well at least preferred. This is because they'd be issued when the company couldn't get normal funding through debt or equity. Thus, issuing preferred stock was a sign of a company or industry in trouble."

2013-01-07 23:48:15,"There seems to be two opinions concerning what to do with a poorly run company

1. Sell, because it's unlikely you can replace/undermine current management, and even if you do it'll be a long road to recovery at least several years long. Furthermore, selling might attract managements' attention and force them to change.

2. As the part owner of a business, it is your right/responsibility to vote according to your best interests. If the business does poorly due to operating failures, you should actively attempt to replace the management, even if you have to wait several years for new profits to appear.

I don't think there's any correct answer to the question of corporate voting. Phillip Fisher advised people to pursue 1) since he was a growth investor. Any time waiting for growth by replacing management was therefore time and capital wasted. Graham invested for value, and thought you could often try 2) when the business was sound but management or finance was not. Then the activist investor could ""unlock"" the potential of the company from the balance sheet by issuing dividends, initiating stock buybacks. Fisher was a long term ""ten bagger"" investor, while Graham preferred medium term buying at a discount and selling at a premium. I suppose their policies regarding voting reflected this."

A few tips:

* The ""[Net Annualized Return](http://www.lendingclub.com/public/lendersPerformanceHelpPop.action)"" provided by LC is different from the ROI measured with other investments. You can calculate your LC ROI with [this tool](http://www.nickelsteamroller.com/portfolio). It will typically be 3-4% lower than the NAR.

I want to see what valuation he puts it at, and his support. 

However I do think Ackman is too aggressive with a target price of $0. I had put value at $33.50 as of last week given different scenarios including bust by Feds, fined by Feds, tweaked business model to be more MLM less pyramid scheme and status quo. Even though it was in the $20-ies at the time, I wouldn't go long because a margin of safety is useless without certainty of downside. Since my scenarios are so vastly different, there was no certainty.


Edit: I forgot to mention that BP was a great hold your nose and buy it stock post oil spill. I don't remember my valuation, but you could take the worst oil spill prior in terms of cost and double it then spread it out a few years (front load costs of course) and the valuation was so high above what the market it was.

With fossil fuels, the profit is the price of electricity minus the cost of the fuel. These profits are regulated by law.

With solar, the profit is price of electricity minus (capital cost + maintenance). But with a high enough capital cost (billions), the barrier of entry becomes high enough that only a few people can take advantage of any potential long term cost advantage. 

But once the initial capital costs are paid for, solar generators become (and stay) a low-cost provider. If fuel costs go up and electricity prices go up, the solar guys will simply increase their cost advantage.

The same principle works with hydro-electricity, but there are small in number, and can't grow (can't build more dams). And if one believes that CO2 emissions will be regulated (additional tax, or some trading scheme) in a decade time, then solar is even more attractive. 

In one sense owning a solar farm is much like owning a regular farm--fixed initial capital costs that generate income for many decades to come. And demand for energy is always increasing."

There's a good reason for that. He wants as many people as possible, to pick up this book and enjoy it. More than anything, it is Lewis's talent in explaining mind-numbingly complex transactions about synthetic credit derivatives (which were at the center of the frenzied bubble maelstrom) into a step-by-step common sense driven decisions that his readers could understand.

Regarding Dr. Burry - I've read more about Dr. Burry than probably anyone else about has (his posts on SI &amp; VIC, books, annual letters, lectures, articles) I feel that he's ***the most underrated investor of our time***. As someone who never had a formal education in investing, he studied and built his own strategy from the ground up and only relied on informed common sense to guide his judgement.

All of the assumptions they made couldn't hold true. Although PAT is 35cr, they pay a 7cr dividend. Only 28cr should be added to retained equity to increase the capital base.

If the PAT is a flat 35cr for the next 5 years, the ROC should decrease over that time period."

I cannot speak to Brazilian companies as a whole and the quality of reporting standards in Brazil, but on an individual company basis, BOBS management has been in place for nearly 20 years and has improved operations and profitably substantially over the years.

Again the only way I lose this game is if the market goes bearish at the wrong time, which it may, but it's statistically the best option given historical data (which I know does not guarantee anything).

2019-04-13 12:12:23,"Barton really is an incredible founder. 

Zillow’s new initiative to buy/sell houses directly from the site has a ton of potential. Real estate agents don’t really add a lot of value on their own, they aggregate information and contacts for you (inspector, lenders, legal) and receive huge 5-8% cuts of the selling price of the home. 

For a $500,000 home, do you really think knowing an inspector, lender, negotiating, and drawing up the correct paper work is worth $35,000 (7% commission)? 

It’s more work, but Is hiring a RE attorney, finding an inspector (through reviews or other people you know), and showing the house really worth that much? If your house has a fair market value of $500,000, wouldn’t it be better to list at $475-485,000 and handle it yourself? 

Priced to get interest from the beginning, and having the right people in place and you’ll still come out ahead after your costs. This part time job for 1-2 months just earned you an extra $10-15000 dollars. Not bad for a part time gig. 

This in theory has been done for years with FSBO, but there’s a lot of bad stories about people’s experiences. If the person on the other side (Zillow) can be an easy to work with intermediary between buyer and seller, there’s even less of a reason to have an agent."
2019-04-13 12:07:34,"The price of assets are going up, but not necessarily their intrinsic value. Remember that housing indexes include larger and modern homes that are being built, this improvement cost would be added to the index on top of the land and deceive homebuyers into believing that their depreciating house will go up in value at the same rate. What homeowners should really be looking at is the inflation of land and bet that against the depreciation of their house on top of maintenance, insurance, property taxes, HOA to really get a picture of if, during a bubble, they will really turn a profit. If interest comes into play, it gets even more difficult to make a profit."

2019-04-13 12:01:36,"From what I understand asset prices are inversely correlated with interest rates which means that no one is ""winning"" when interest rates get artificially forced down low because asset prices rise in tandem such that the total cost of the debt is the same. Once the interest rates rise again, people's assets drop, most panic sell, and a deflationary spiral occurs.

In a free market, full reserve interest rate system the interest rates - price of money - would adjust for the scarcity and abundancy of lender money. When money is constrained, interest rates rise, only high profit businesses would be lent to therefore making the best use of the money available in the economy. When money is in abundance, interest rates drop, and lenders are willing to let you use their money on the cheap organically because there are not enough investments being implemented and it is time for ""experimentation"" and ""innovation"". With artificially low interest rates this ""experimentation"" goes on without any checks or balances and perpetuates malinvestment, prices keep rising, people's productivity keeps stagnating/declining and everyone becomes poorer."
2019-04-13 11:43:32,"Do investors really spend their energy caring about margins during a growth phase? I think the big ask is is there growing demand and production to eventually meet that demand. Once they have a customer base they can upsell on other compatible products to their model 3s such as supercharging, battery replacements, service department, powerwalls, solar panels/roofs, subscription services, autopilot.

That's why I look at the model 3 not as a profit making tool but as a gateway product. The more stubborn drivers they can switch to the electric drivetrain, the more successful they are in my eyes."
2019-04-13 10:23:24,The decline came more from the fear of uncertainty about the economy(a lot but not all related to China trade wars) and interest rates in my opinion.

2019-04-13 09:24:09,"Housing, real estate, stocks/equities, bonds.

The price of bonds is inverse to yields/interest rates, so when rates go down, the price of bonds go up.

This also pushes up stock prices because people will make less money from parking it in savings accounts or bonds, so stocks are more attractive in comparison.

Housing and real estate prices go up due to increased demand from lower interest rates (lower monthly payments), especially when the Fed directly buys mortgage-backed securities.

For example Congress needs to pass new spending budget and debt ceiling measures ASAP after they get back from their vacations or there will be a government shutdown first week of October. Congress passing ANYTHING at all is never easy, even when tensions and conflicts are not as high as they are now. So that's not good. 

Bridgewater could be hedging their Treasury exposure via derivatives and/or tactically choosing certain spots on the yield curve to move out to. But in this case, actual CASH (NOT EQUIVALENTS) seems like a particularly appropriate choice in the short term. One can add a USD currency hedge layered on top of this as the dollar may weaken further. "

Also, in cases of large established private companies (e.g. Cargill or Mars...) while many of the techniques one would use are similar to how comparable public companies are analyzed, there are key differences for private companies. Most notably. valuation multiples on private companies tend to be lower vs comparable public companies...When analyzing a larger private company, private equity firms or investment banks or whoever is doing it, often will estimate both ""if public"" and ""if private"" valuations for a company."

2017-08-22 06:02:59,"It's pretty much the same as with a public company, if you do not have the financial figures, there is really now way you are going to be able to evaluate it.

As for where to get the figures, if it's a big company like Uber, there has been plenty of information leaked about how much they charge, their burn rate, debt situation, capital raises, billings. With enough work, you can slowly piece it together and get a rough picture of the company's financial situation. Someone with a good grasp of accounting would be able to do this with uber despite the limited financial data.

There are also databases of data but you would have to pay and the availability is going to come down to the legislation in that particular country. Or if you have enough money and are interested in buying a substantial stake in the company then you will likely get access to the books.

So you basically have two options, either have enough money to pay for some sort of data service or have good enough accounting and investigation skills that you can sort of piece together a picture of the financial statements based particular data that is publicly available.

Since you're new to this, I would recommend sticking to public companies and working to understand everything about accounting that you can.

2017-08-22 03:13:05,"For a stock pitch in equity research, I think you would be better off using an income statement model to calculate EPS because future corporate earnings growth is the main factor that drives stock performance. A more efficient method would be to forecast revenue segment growth and EBIT margin to forecast future EPS, and using P/E for upside/downside/base cases. DCF models, while being the most detailed, are better off for entire business valuations so they reign in IB and private equity. For equity research, they're too time consuming due to all the time you will use up talking to contacts and filtering out the good information from the noise (source: took an equity research class as an elective, my professor was an ER analyst and associate director at Morgan Stanley)."

It is not about making 100% of the voters happy, it is about the most supported option winning. That can leave 49.9% 'unhappy', but that is how the system is meant to work.

2017-08-21 21:00:22,Very interesting and understandable. Will be screenshotting that post and keeping it in mind. 
2017-08-21 20:57:56,"While I'm at it, let me briefly cover what I think is the number #1 problem with ""novice"" equity research. 

They practice what I refer to as ""elevator analysis"". (See 95% of SeekingAlpha, /r/investing, Zacks, etc research). 

An elevator analysis occurs when the analyst will regurgitate trends in revenue, margins, earnings, etc by way of saying ""Revenue was up ~10% YoY"", or ""the Company's forward P/E ratio is at a 20% premium to the comparable average"". So on so forth. 

This is a tricky position young analysts fall into because to them it FEELS like they're communicating good information and producing a work product, but they're actually completely missing the point of where analysts add value. 

I don't need you to tell me revenue went up or down, or that the multiple is at a premium/discount to historical/comparable averages. I'm capable of arriving at those conclusions myself with a simple glance at the numbers. 

What you should focus on is the WHY behind those metrics. 

WHY did revenue go up 10%? WHY did margins increase 150bps when consensus only modeled 50bps? WHY did the Company only repurchase $20mn worth of shares over the year when they said they were going to retire $100mn? (Hint: Its probably because management are idiots and didn't realize a $100mn buyback announcement would put them in a position to be shaky on a principal payment). 

If you can learn to identify the cause/effect relationships behind the numbers, and succinctly communicate the story underpinning the financials, you will be a valuable asset wherever you work. "
2017-08-21 20:56:13,"This is all great information that I really needed. I appreciate this very much. So, it sounds like I should spend most my time preparing for interviews by just learning the business' and their industries. Would you agree?"
2017-08-21 20:46:03,"&gt;What exactly would you mention in this section of a stock pitch though? 

My methodology may vary from some, but in my opinion a perfect pitch has the framework of something like - two thesis points which will effect earnings, one thesis point on something structural with the business that is underappreciated and adds and extra ""oompf"" to the thesis. You don't need to have all of that, but I've found that to be my sweet spot when evaluating the quality of my ideas. 

But anyway, my pitches are structured so that I walk through my points which will effect earnings/EBITDA/whatever...so that by the time I get to the valuation its more like ""Yea so I just told you why EPS will be $0.25 instead of $1.00, the business is already trading at 10x so instead of $10.00 the equity is worth $2.50"" and call it a day. 

Edit: It's my opinion that analysts who underwrite multiples expansion/contraction in their security analysis take on unnecessary, non-fundamental risk. I bet you 9/10 times if you strip out changes in the multiple in this work you'll find the underlying EPS/EBITDA numbers to be in-line, or within the margin of error, of consensus estimates. This is not good because in these cases what ends up driving your thesis is market sentiment/judgement rather than changes in business fundamentals the market is not expecting. 

&gt;How much time would it take to prep a stock pitch?

Depends on the complexity of the idea and how much time you need to work it out. I've been assigned a stock to look at and pitch for an interview and had 2 weeks to throw something together, but I know people who've had ~1 week or less. But generally if you're going in to interview for a buyside/research it is expected that you'll already have pitches prepared.

&gt;Anything else I should know to be prepared for interview?

Buyside/research interviews are very different than the typical investment banking process. You can find loads of interview guides with technical questions that you can memorize/regurgitate and as long as you don't come off as a psychopath you can land an investment banking position. Doesn't work that way with investing. Within the first 5 minutes I can tell if the person I'm speaking with is truly passionate about research/investing or if they just saw the earnings potential for a $1bn hedge fund under 2&amp;20 and decided thats what they wanted to do. 

I will tell you that NONE of my buyside interviews actually felt like ""interviews"". They were all basically just shooting the shit about stocks with whomever I was speaking with, and I honestly think thats the way they should go/feel. This experience ranges from meeting with folks at no-name, sub &lt; $1bn funds to top HFs. As far as I'm concerned there isn't a difference in the type of person who works at either sort of place when they have the passion for investing.

So really your main goal should be communicating that you have the passion and drive for investing. Though getting this point across is largely qualitative, so I don't really think there are any internet resources out there which will help with that. "

2017-08-21 20:38:16,Becoming a competent business analyst is far more valuable than financial modeling. 
2017-08-21 20:38:12,"Good on you for being ambitious. DCF &amp; other valuation templates should be the core of your quantitative analysis. That said -- and I'll just be succinct -- a model is only as good as its underlying assumptions. In the case of a DCF, you should be able to qualitatively justify your (1) revenue growth outlook, (2) margin trends, (3) terminal growth rate and/or EV/EBITDA multiple, etc.

Those assumptions serve as the core of any good stock pitch and will only hold weight if you do the requisite background research (both company &amp; industry specific) AND synthesize your findings in a creative manner (this means not relying on the consensus). In my mind, this is where the real fun lies; formulating a thesis allows you to add your own touch to a presentation and is much more fruitful than plugging in numbers into an Excel model.

To summarize, models belong in the appendix of your stock pitch. They should complement a qualitatively-based stance that is both creative and sound from a logical perspective."
2017-08-21 19:41:33,"When I was first learning I'd go through 10Ks&amp;Qs, investor presentations, and earnings transcripts and would consult textbooks when I came across concepts I didn't understand.

2017-08-21 19:38:51,"No, not harsh at all. You gave me the feedback I was looking for, I appreciate it. 

Like I said, I am new to this and I am taking this work in as a learning experience. You seem like you have a lot of experience with interviews and this industry. I am glad you pointed out how minor the valuation section is of a stock pitch. It sounds like valuation is the last part of a stock pitch for an interview. What exactly would you mention in this section of a stock pitch though? How much time would it take to prep a stock pitch?
 
Anything else I should know to be prepared for interview?

 
"
2017-08-21 19:31:58,"This was not harsh at all, more of a dose of reality. For someone that is trying to understand businesses, do you think it'll be better to go more textbook or to jump into the 10-k's, q's, etc? If you do recommend the textbook route, any specifics? "
2017-08-21 19:16:53,"&gt;I am hoping to use these models for stock pitches during an interview for entry-level positions in asset management and equity research mainly.

Alright, so I'm gonna stop you right there give a dose of tough love. 

If I were interviewing a candidate for a research position, and they handed me a MODEL of their DCF I would auto-ding them. Why? Because it doesn't take any effort at all to find a DCF template online, plug in your Co's. historical #s, dart throw some assumptions and come out with a target price. The target price of a DCF is NOT the purpose of a DCF. 

The point of your valuation is to stress test your operating assumptions and key value drivers under different scenarios - usually base, bull, and bear. 

What asset managers/equity research folks want to see in competitive candidates is the ability to synthesize and critically think about businesses - what they do, how they operate, what makes them successful/tick, etc. Whether someone can put together a solid valuation model is really not a concern...at least not of mine. If a candidate comes in and can talk for hours about how consensus' estimates of $3.00 forward earnings is bullshit, but doesn't even know how to open an Excel worksheet, I will take them over an excel wizard every time. 

I'm not sure how much fundamental work you've done on your company, and I could be way off on this, but the fact that you said you haven't built an operating model yet makes me think you haven't done much yet. 

If you're going to post the DCF for us...at least include some bullets on how you came up with your assumptions. How are you coming up with your revenue growth rates? They all appear to be hard coded except for Y5 which is an average. You have operating margins expanding from 12% to 15%...why? How? Why is D&amp;A and capex increasing as a % of revenue? Why is 8x an appropriate EBITDA multiple to assume? 

The point I'm trying to make is that there is SO much more to fundamental analysis than putting together a DCF. Your time would be much better spent figuring out the business and answering the above questions than spending hours on a valuation model. Really, your valuation should take no more than 5 minutes at the end of the day and I can't really think of the marginal benefit of spending hours on a DCF rather than a quick back of the envelope calculation. 

As a candidate what you should be focusing on is how you can add value to a senior analyst through your understanding of a repeatable research process and business acumen. When I was interviewing for an analyst position practically the entire interview sessions were just chatting about stocks and going over my pitches. Do you wanna know how much time was spent on the valuation part? Maybe 1-2 minutes explaining why I used a certain approach and that was it. 

Sorry if this comes off as harsh, but I'd rather you spend your time working hard in the right direction rather than the wrong direction. "

Couple of thoughts.  Capex&lt;da implies your capital is shrinking while the business is growing.  Most likely not realistic esp in terminal year since at infinite it would mean you invested capital is zero.

paywall:

How do you separate a department store chain from its debt? Hudson’s Bay is trying to find out.

The owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord and Taylor is in talks to buy Neiman Marcus Group, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Hudson’s Bay wants to buy Neiman’s assets, but not the retailer’s $5 billion in debt. Hudson’s Bay’s own debt already stands at a hefty 5.6 times estimates for its fiscal 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company declined to comment on the deal but said it looks for opportunities to grow “while maintaining or enhancing its credit profile.”

The unconventional arrangement may seem like a relatively low-risk proposition for Hudson’s Bay, but Neiman’s bondholders aren’t likely to love it. The company, which was purchased by its current private-equity owners for $6 billion, including debt, in 2013.

Last fall, Neiman’s lenders allowed it to extend the maturity on its credit line from 2018 to 2021, buying it some time. The company scrapped its plans to go public in January.

For bondholders, the deal may be the best payoff they can hope for. Neiman’s bonds have fallen more than 11% this year and yield more than 10%, according to FactSet.

Sales at Neiman have been in steep decline, falling 6.7% to $2.47 billion in the 26 weeks ended Jan. 28. The company reported a net loss of $140.6 million for the period.

Neiman debt holders now face a choice between continuing the long march toward bankruptcy and an unpalatable deal that at least gives them something. Investors in other debt-laden retailers should beware. "

It was also a good place for parents to bring kids. Its just boring now.

2017-03-14 01:59:32,"Tesla says it will get a 20%+ margin on the Model 3. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. In either case, it's certainly not easy, it's incredibly hard, which is why most of Tesla's engineers work on designing the factory to build the Model 3 rather than the Model 3 itself. Tesla does actually have a coherent argument here as to why it's different from any other car maker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Szj2qIYX8 Elon Musk has never actually failed to deliver on a grandiose promise before, like returning rockets from orbit and landing them with the precision of a helicopter. He's only been late. The Gigafactory may not live up to Musk's promises, but hey, I think he's earned some credibility at this point. 

Tesla doesn't do marketing. It doesn't need to. The UBS estimate that it will cost $8 billion to build out the supercharger network misunderstands the purpose of superchargers. UBS bases its estimate on achieving the same coverage as gas stations. Superchargers aren't designed to replace gas stations. Superchargers are intended for long-distance travel only. You're meant to charge at home or use destination chargers for everyday charging. "
2017-03-14 00:36:28,"I work in commercial real estate and have been intimately involved in several B/C mall transactions in recent years. I've got a couple thoughts on this.


* Generally anchor tenants like Macy's or sears own their underlying real estate or operate under low rate long term leases. This means any income from these tenants is at most a couple $100k annually, usually not enough to throw one of these malls into default. The much larger issue comes from cotenancy clauses in other tenant leases. This means if Macy's decides to close, someone like H&amp;M who would otherwise be locked in on a 10 year lease now has the right to either terminate their lease or stay open but only pay a fraction of their previous rent. The cascading effect this can have is what really pushes these malls over the edge. Macy's is probably a curveball, but a lot of the smart operators have seen the writing on the wall and negotiated their leases to avoid this where possible.


* CMBS debt has been difficult to come by on favorable terms for enclosed malls for nearly 10 years. We are at the tail end of the ""wall of maturities"" and will see the last round of CMBS 1.0 defaults coming up shortly. After that, any deals from 2010 - present in enclosed malls have really not been priced aggressively. Underwriting standards for loans have increased dramatically. High cap rate cash buyers have really dominated the REO and second tier market, which is where these closures are likely to occur anyway.


* Strong malls or those in A markets (like those owned by GGP or Simon) actually want these anchors out in a lot of situations. Redevelopment into lifestyle pieces or even just splitting the box and adding junior anchors like tjx or dicks sporting goods have been strong value add plays at a lot of malls. Think of what kind of value seritage is trying to unlock.

Overall, I'm glad I don't work exclusively with malls, but the situation is a lot more nuanced than people give credit for."

2017-03-13 22:39:12,"Why are you comparing margins earned on a $100k car and a $150k SUV with a $35k car (that is not gonna average that much  after options btw, it's going to be more like $45k to 50k which is NOT mass market). 

DO you think the margins on a 3 and 7 series are the same, or a C and S class? Obviously the margins Tesla makes are due to the high sticker prices, there's no way they can compete in the mass market and earn the same. 

If it were so easy, why don't BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Toyota, Honda, Lexus etc. do it? You CAN assume that Tesla's margin will be thin because they have NOTHING that other manufacturers can't and haven't copied. 

Also, gross margins don't mean anything when you have to cover marketing, G&amp;A, R&amp;D, cash taxes, and cash interest as well. 

The other thing you're missing is that lets say Tesla has 400k cars on the road. Where are they all going to go to charge and get serviced? If Tesla wants to build out a service and charging network, that's going to cost upwards of $15bn (UBS estimates $18bn). Those are slim margin businesses, and returns on capital are poor (as they are in cars), so as a shareholder who stands at risk of being diluted, I would question why I'm funding projects with a ROIC of ~10% when my cost of capital should be 15 to 20% for a company as risky as Tesla.

There are sentiment cycles, that I think are best explained by the confluence of good/bad economic conditions, posture vis a vis risk and biology. A good paper on the biology is 'From Molecule to Market'. If you accept that the wider economy is cyclical, then it's not a stretch to suggest credit spreads would also be cyclical.

Equity valuations also exhibit something approaching a sentiment cycle.

http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1538/331

Some cycles are caused simply by the long lags before supply stimulated by higher price comes online. I think that's probably true of most of the commodity complex.

Same goes for shipping. Pops in shipping rates are caused by high levels of fleet utilisation. The pops stimulate supply, which eventually flattens rates."
2017-03-12 10:40:46,"I am no expert, and won't claim to be... But I'll take a stab at it.

Similar to how people need sleep, society tends to funnel necessities into specific time frames.

Growth is necessary during certain times, and harmful during others. I feel that there are many organic, as well as intentional, affects to balance growth. This balance creates a cycle.

I may be very confused, so I urge you to take this as solely opinion, rather than being empirically verified. "

The ERP seems to be getting compressed as there is a reach for yield and that will continue as long as interest rates are low.

Also... Inherently doesn't the dividend growth rate increase with a decrease in interest rates as you're implicitly increasing your expected earnings due to lower interest costs?

2018-01-29 15:42:13,"Some random thoughts as to why predicting CapEx is difficult and/or not a valuable use of time:

* CapEx investment depends a lot on strategy. Is the company in a highly competitive industry where investment in equipment leads to competitive advantage? Then the business is prone to regularly invest in CapEx. However, if the business is a non capital-intensive business CapEx will rarely occur and will not be a material use of cash flow. This also fails to take into account changes in strategy which makes CapEx predictions even more uncertain.
* The depreciated value of PP&amp;E isn't a very meaningful number. A company may accelerate the depreciation of PP&amp;E for tax purposes, or match it more closely with annual CapEx for predictability. Unless you fully know the assets, expected lives, maintenance spend, etc. (which is unlikely given info limitations as a public market investor) asset value just isn't that meaningful.
* Market reactions to CapEx/investment announcement are highly dependent on the ""story"" in the market. For example, as a result of the oil price decline over the past few years, major oil cos got very disciplined and slashed their capex budgets. For them to announce big upswings in CapEx at this point would likely be viewed as negative. Similarly, a major retailer announcing a major investment in physical infrastructure or build out of a larger store network would likely be punished by the market for investing in a dying space."

Since it’s consistent, share price is affected when they have to re-up on capital, which you can predict fairly accurately by modeling their cash burn. They also tend to raise after completing milestones (each phase of clinical trial), giving even more precision. 

But I think Biotech is the only sector that has such pre-commercial companies (unless you consider ICOs as a sector).

2018-01-29 11:25:30,"&gt; Is it possible to predict...

No. 

And I don't mean that to be rude, but to save you a lot of time chasing down the age-old rabbit hole of trying to divine future events. Knowing the future is simply one of those things that is not-knowable can help you put your efforts to greater use.

Now, you made a fair observation about looking at a company's depreciation schedules. Which, on the face of it, seems like a reasonable strategy. EXCEPT! There may be multitude of reasons why Company A chooses a certain depreciation schedule, to the point where the literal expected life of the asset is no longer the chief concern. Depreciation is one of those things that often gets twisted and mired by the guesswork of accounting.

So what does that leave us with? Well, if it's an industry you are intimately familiar with, you might have a general sense for how long certain things stay ""in fashion"" before they start feeling dated or obsolete. And, if you have a sense for the personalities behind the management team, you might be able to glean some sort of impression about what motivated their decisions. Are they penny pinchers? Big spenders? Do they care about how others perceive them, and by extension, their company? Is it possible they feel a strong incentive to ""keep up with the Joneses""? Questions like this...

The other angle to look at is to get a sense for what management's priorities may be in relation to value. If they're rabid hawks about generating long-term value and have an incentive structure in place that rewards this long-term focus, then seeing them drop a large amount of money toward ""modernizing"" superfluous assets would probably seem highly out of character. So your thoughts might then turn toward trying to identify the ""key ingredients"" for the business. What is absolutely crucial to their dominance in xyz? What threatens that dominance? Is it something they can possibly guard against by outspending their competition in &lt;asset xyz&gt;?

Just my two cents! Take it or leave it, but maybe these thought exercises help somewhat? 

TLDR: It may be more useful to try to ""get inside the heads"" of management to understand how they view their competitive landscapes and then put yourself in their shoes. I readily admit this too may be an exercise in absurdity, but (unfortunately?) it may a bit more grounded than getting lost in the weeds in accounting as it relates to depreciation schedules."

Well first off got to account for inflation, the 25 cents of 1985 is now .57 cents according to an online inflation calculator (not scientific, ik)

Technology over long periods of time is inflationary, especially w/ moore's law and the fact that this years product is ~20-30% better than last year. Think of this like an economic deflator. A 100 dollar computer is getting ~30% slower relative to everything else each year, and that's before depreciation of use.

3. mREIT would be a bad example for inflation proof. They hold bonds which will drop in price when interest rates go up as inflation rises.

Now, some caution: Predicting the macro is a game not worth playing. Prem Watsa predicted for years that there'd be a deflation and that never came. I think its best to buy undervalued assets and wait patiently.

2018-01-28 23:33:19,Not necessarily the case. Buzz words and macro stuff are what drive the market and most analysts take that into account sub-consciously (timing the market). No point being right on the intrinsic value of a stock but it'd take 100 years for the stock to correct itself.
2018-01-28 23:31:28,"The answer above is good. Adding some more to it:

Monish Pabrai looks for strong balance sheet and low cost producer when investing in commodity stocks. Both of these factors help a commodity company to ride the low cycle without going into bankruptcy. That is the biggest risk - getting assets taken away from equity holders. 

The uncertainty comes from not knowing when or how the commodity cycle will turn.

2018-01-28 23:24:34,"Almost no one invests in the forgotten undervalued companies when I tell them about it. I even tell them the whole thesis but they don't get it because either they don't want to hold a contrarian stock or they find it not exciting enough. 

A few examples from last year have been RFP (forest products) and DS (golf).

This leads me to think that value investing is not just analysis but more of a behavioral challenge (going against the crowd)."

I want to re-iterate the comment above. If you look at [Goldman Sachs index of high tax companies to low tax companies](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2017/03/27/Photos/NS/MW-FI954_hitax__20170327083701_NS.png?uuid=139d4d12-12ea-11e7-aeb9-001cc448aede) (I can't find a more updated image on Google), share prices moved almost in lock-step with how much progress investors thought Congress was making on tax reform throughout 2017.

&gt; ... attempting to figure out where a companies actual tax benefit differs from market expectations.

2018-01-28 22:39:55,"The way I look at it, where a company's intrinsic value lands on the value stack (assets, earnings, growth) makes no difference. Value investing isn't about ignoring growth but rather about demanding a margin of safety for it.  
Buying a company with great growth potential at a price that assumes little to no growth, is value investing. Buying a company with great growth potential at a price that assumes great growth potential, is not value investing."

Stocks are hot right now, bonds are about to get crushed if they shock rates, and retail investors/traders have flooded in during a time of fee-free trades, which democraticized a lot of the popular stocks as they moved up the bid.

Cash burn shouldn't really be a concern. They're in their growth phase. This isn't Ford we're dealing with here. Capex will keep being super high.

Obviously they're nothing compared to Ford and GM, but comparing two mature stage auto manufacturers with huge cash on their hands and massive economies of scale to a 5 year old car company persuing advanced technologies from the get go is stupid.

Investing is not mostly luck, it's more like backgammon, using one of his analogies from the show.

Getting there is very, very difficult, but seeing those people that are legendary is something else altogether - a tiny sliver of investors, really."

OP didn't say it is inventory, he said it's the closest thing you get to inventory. I agree it's not a great analogy, especially since drillers refer to unbooked locations as inventory.

According to this article, current AUM is $5.5bn, with $1bn of his own, and $1bn of greenlight re.  So like you said, mostly external - $3.5bn.

At peak, the AUM was supposedly $12bn.  Let's simplistically assume that all of those 3 buckets declined by say 20%, since peak until current (weighted avg) - based on me eyeballing those returns since 2014 and assuming some negative contribution from 2018.  That takes the capital to $9.6bn.

Delta between $9.6bn and $5.5bn is $4.1bn, which implies that most of the external capital has already gone out of the door (only $3.5bn left), even allowing for the 20% assumption (which tbh I think is unrealistic - I'm guessing a meaningful amount would have started going from mid-2015 onwards).

Also I wouldn't be surprised if more capital has left since that article from the start of July... given worse performance as well as that article."

2018-10-05 11:32:52,"What analyst was that?

I'd like to read the rest of the note but that sounds about right.

I'm surprised they would say Q3 was strong. Everything I've heard is that Q3 was looking soft (at least relative to analyst consensus) for all the pumpers.

I think the fall was/is due to overall negative sentiment in Canada around oil and gas. I think the KML pipeline facing delays exacerbated it and we've been in a downspiral ever since. There has been zero good news since then (outside of LNG Canada which mind bogglingly didn't move any of the stocks).

Additionally, there's been bad weather in Alberta. Unlike the southern US, Canada's q2 is their weakest for the pumpers because all the snow melts and makes it impossible to drill because everything is essentially a muddy bog. They call this spring breakup. Unfortunately, the weather has included a ton of snow causing similar conditions (some colloquially call it a fall breakup) which has softened capex in Q3 and that will leak into q4 as the weather is continuing.

I don't see any long term reasons we would see a significant downturn in pressure pumping. Canada is relatively transitory right now and once pipeline capacity starts to come online spreads should close and capex should pickup. I've read in the US we're starting to see a bit less intensity on the fracking side but nothing concerning. 

I don't understand how the analyst doesn't see any near term catalysts. Positive capex budgets from E&amp;P companies would be a near term catalyst.

TCW is the only stock that should be getting hammered since they're a Canadian pure play. Even the selling there is overdone.

I think STEP has been hit harder than the other two because of it's small float and it can't catch a bid right now. I'm waiting for a bit more of a technical chart sign to add since it could drop further before it bounces.

I think we're at max negativity (or near it) at this point. Shorts have piled in in Sept so there could be a squeeze at some point

I haven't listened to the podcast yet, but what are you trying to say here? That you think Marks is going to outperform because he is unskilled, is investing in lower returning parts of the market, has higher fees, or what?"

2018-10-05 10:28:43,"Thanks for the writeup.  This stock has taken a dive in the past 3 months, do you know the reason?  Is the concern that future project and the revenues from that will dry up?  From an analyst, ""Mr. Bradford said in a note: ""STEP had a reasonably active 3Q, though like others, there are holes in the 4Q schedule. It's widely appreciated that STEP took dramatic measures to secure a new large format customer, but we believe competitive realities provide sufficient rationale, as we describe below. Similar to TCW [Trican Well Service], we have trouble pointing to any specific near-term catalyst, though it does sound as though work programs in its Oklahoma-based U.S. fracturing group are more promising than anticipated""

The excellence is not debatable; the valuation discussion is worryingly arbitrary. So, I tend not to worry about valuation unless truly egregious levels are struck – say a price/earnings ratio of 30 times or more. """

Just a question what distinguishes the economics from markets analysis to the economics from macro analysis? I ask as, if I recall correctly, they look at the same data. Albeit, econometrics looks at it from a more quantitative/statistical approach. (Assuming I'm right in assuming econometrics is almost identical to quantitative analysis.)"

Though keep in mind it's not going to make you any much better at predicting the future, so if your aim is to do markets analysis so as to trade short term positions, you will likely lose a lot of money.

If want to do securities analysis then focus on learning fundamental investing of the various securities and how to analyze businesses.

If you want to macro-economic analysis then I think you should start with some micro and macro economics courses on cousera or one of those platforms
"
2018-10-04 16:35:04,"At present my goal is getting better at macro analysis, alongside general market analysis. 

My other goal is educational, in that I'd like to know the differences.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for an educational perspective, I'd like to know the types of analysis and differs them. I know types like technical, sentiment (the concept, not any method) and the basics of company analysis. 

Though I noticed you differentiated economic analysis and macro analysis- I was under the notion that they were the same?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of how I define the stuff:

Markets analysis, I believe is financial markets analysis-- I guess analysing the capital markets in terms of how they would with trading with charts. Though, I believe it is financial markets analysis after your post which you outlined is broad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Securities, I would imagine stocks/bonds/derivatives based on my limited knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps, if you need me to clear up any more, please let me know. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit off-topic:

I suppose what would help if I knew of any books/reading which goes into the different types of financial markets analysis. As you said, it is broad, so something like a reference/text book guide which goes into what each type is and how they're conducted in practice would help. 

I know the first reply would be ""check the sidebar"", but I've looked into a few sidebars and there's nothing about financial analysis in general.

Would he have sold at $170 then? If so, how is that a long time holding? That is the basic issue with all of these positions: you go in based on discount to NAV, inevitably you find out that NAV wasn't what you thought it was, and then you hold because...well, you are in it now.

If you are going to do this, ignore NAV and look at the underlying growth in whatever it is that you own (and don't buy based on NAV then hold based on some other idea).

And don't write a post on this either. Unless you an odd person, you are not going to be able to sell after this post. If you choose to bail, fine post about it because it is done. But if you are holding on, writing about it is like strapping yourself to the wheel as it goes down. That doesn't mean holding is a bad idea, writing about it definitely is though."

2019-10-21 01:13:24,"Too long. You have all these random, non-sequitur facts but no focus on stuff that will move the share price.

Even as a long-form report - with more general information about the company - it is still way too flabby. Don't say stuff like, paraphrasing: ""retail has low margins"" or ""margins went from x% to y%""...it just isn't interesting.

One thing that might help is to go back through it, and look for the stuff that is really important. What are the real headlines? What caused movement in the financials? Then build a story around that information? Stuff like ""high ROE"" or whatever isn't a thing, no-one cares (because that is already in the price).

You shouldn't have charts breaking up the text (use columns). And your layout for the charts is pretty bad too (backwards X axis, very boring to look at and kind of uninformative).

Finally, this reads like you are young and need more writing experience. A lot of your writing is clumsy which obscures the point of your argument.  Readers, particularly in finance, like clear and predictable writing.

To show you what I mean (I have picked this para at random):

&gt;What I think is one of the metrics that demonstrate that DG is a great business is its phenomenal ROE and other metrics that study the return on shareholder’s capital. Not only is the core business remarkably attractive, but the management has also made reasonable capital allocations decisions and has done so consistently, resulting in a rise of both equity and ROE. The figures for the last 10 years are shown in figure 10.

You could say instead with no loss of meaning:

&gt;DG's consistently high ROE is due to good capital allocation decisions by management (Figure 10).

I don't like this point at all. You shouldn't make this observation without talking directly about the decisions (i.e. which decisions, specifically, were good). But, hopefully, you get the larger point.

I would try writing far shorter summary pieces, and just repeatedly go over them and cut the fat. Doing this will also make clearer to you what information is actually important."
2019-10-21 00:35:38,"There no way of telling what future cash the company will generate will be. Of course this will always play a factor, but other aspects cloud a fundamental outlook. Companies like Fiat Chrysler will likely earn a consistent amount of money for the next decade, however are incredibly discounted relative to a company like IBM that will likely do the same. The market decides what earnings multiplier to assign based on what others are willing to assign it (ie supply and demand). An example would be the difference in P/E multipliers. If every company was only valued based on future earnings, all companies would end up with the same forward P/E ratio. However, that is not even close to true."

2020-04-30 17:36:17,Emerging markets usually lack foreign reserves to stabilize currency in these situations so I would expect to see some national debt crises in emerging markets.  Another consequence is an increase in USD dependence where struggling emerging markets who aren’t already pegged to USD institute a semi floating peg.  If I wanted to make a huge leap I’d say eventually inflation catches up with the USD and causes an even bigger issue down the road where even the world reserve currency has problems holding value.

2020-04-30 16:45:08,"I'm no expert on Japan, but I do remember the Nikkei trading above 40,000 before they started to collapse rates after the crash of '87. From what I hear they've been treading water ever since - that's why they can't raise rates.

Take into account that, depending on what time-frame you include, a fair historical average for the price of money is around 6%-7%. Remember, the rate also has to be interesting enough for savers, not just borrowers. That's why it's called a damned *interest* rate.

Apart from giving no incentive to save, the main trouble with zero, or near-zero rates (as most large economy CBs have been peddling for more than a decade) is that there's little or no room to stimulate when needed.

Drop a rate from from 0.50% to 0%... meh. Drop it from 7% to 1% if you have to, bam! that's stimulus!

But there's another existential problem with super low rates. The deposit, or risk-free rate is an anchor to value. It offers a safe alternative against which, in theory, all investments should be weighed. Sure, cheap money can create a lot of new enterprise, but it also give births to a lot of duds. If you can finance at 0% and earn a return of half a percent, you look like a genius. Probably explains a lot of the new billionaires.

I believe monetary policy, other than urgent rescue packages, is moot under current circumstances.

Fiscal policy has to be kicked into high gear, in the form Government work programs for infrastructure, like FDR did in the 1930s. Right now the economy needs spending on manufacturing, transport, education, and hospitals, a heck of a lot more than we need to reflate stock valuations -- quickly, quickly, before the next reporting season."

It is far more pleasant to own Visa than it is to own the stuff he owns. Since inception, he has beat the Russel 2000 and russell microcap by 5-7% annualized (AFTER FEES). Over time, I don't think the Russell will underperform the SP500. He is one of the highest alpha managers out there. 

If you don't like the russell exposure, any investor can buy puts on it or just short the russell. They would have (and likely continue to have) a very good return stream."

I looked into Dominos a few months ago. From a industry perspective, the fact that consumer’s tastes can change so quickly turned me off. 

Pizza hut, Papa Johns, Dominos  all suffered declines in the past years. Dominos turned it around but i just wasn’t convinced it was a long term phenomenon, especially in the age of uber eats, grub hub, etc. 20 years ago delivery was only pizza and chinese takeout, now its anything you want.

2020-04-30 15:02:47,"VLO stock was up almost 15% after releasing Q1 earnings yesterday (though has given some back today). The near-term operational outlook was bad though better than expected. But the big story was management’s conviction in continuing to pay its current dividend. They mentioned it several times (see below for quotes). The original thesis was that the stock was cheap assuming a dividend cut. If the dividend is sustained, the IRR increases by over 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**We continue to prioritize our investment grade credit rating and non-discretionary uses of capital, including sustaining capital expenditures on our dividend**, and you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses primarily organic growth capital and buybacks.  
\[. . .\]  
We've got this capital allocation framework in place that we've adhered to for years and within that framework, **we consider the use of cash for sustaining CapEx and turnarounds and then the dividends to be non-discretionary**.  
\[. . .\]  
But if you look at additional actions that has been taken, we have a very capable proactive Board of Directors and they declared the dividend last Friday. And they have the same confidence in our business and this team that I have. So the things that we've talked about for years are the things that we've implemented and that we use both when margins are really strong and when margins are weak, like they have been here over the last six or eight weeks, and so **in my view relative to the dividend we've got a long way to go before we need to take any action there**."

But I named MSFT and AMZN and encourage you look at more web service based companies that have a little bit of an economic moat protecting their business... both MSFT and AMZN are big players in scalable content hosting and that seems relatively future proof and immune, maybe even benefitted, by COVID keeping everyone isolated in their homes. Healthcare is another industry (which got beat up a little bit yesterday) which is unlikely to be negative impacted by COVID. People still get sick, they still need medicine, and while a Democratic win in November might be seen as a headwind it’s by no means a reason to avoid the industry altogether. I tend to go for small cap development stage names but I see some promise in bigger players like GILD and BMY though I would wait for GILD to come down a little after this remdesivir run up... I’m not particularly convinced by the results I’ve seen so far or by the fact that they substantially changed the trial design half way through, ordinarily that would kill any FDA application but these are desperate times. 

Banks are also just a safe bet on a longer time horizon, everyone knows they’re all fucked in the near term but there is some serious value to be had looking at price to book ratios. When interest rates do inevitably one day maybe in the future possibly go up you’ll be happy to own those (of course some have speculated we’ll be at full stimulus for decades to come and amazingly the rationale is not unreasonable which is scary). 

Then you’ve got dividend plays like some of these mortgage REITs or $T (ATT) which is yielding 7%. Is that dividend safe? For ATT I would say “yes” and for REITs it depends on the nature of he underlying property but yeah, the housing market seems to be relatively protected this time around though we will undoubtedly see some defaults by the time summer is over. Probably some opportunity there. 

Of course the best approach is to invest in things you’re familiar with. Think you’ll still be using apple devices in 5-10 years? It’s a great core position to hold with good growth and modest yield. Think you’ll be driving a Tesla? Buy Tesla! Musk’s idiocy be damned! Think you’ll be shopping at the mall at Macy’s? When’s the last time you did that? Probably want to avoid. I’m certainly not about to get on a plane or cruise ship anytime soon if it can be helped and I don’t think I’ve been to a movie theatre in well over two years. When you invest in companies you’re familiar with in your every day life, it’s much easier to stay on top of your due diligence and understand how extraneous events can impact the business on a fundamental level. That’s what retail investing is all about. The only client you have to worry about is yourself!

Notice cases and hospital reduce use continues to trend steadily upwards. In the moronic tweet you reference, Musk suggests that because the early estimates were so much worse than the current reality, we should open back up the economy. In fact, the data conclusively shows CA is likely months away from considering reopening under the very optimistic federal guidelines put forward by the Trump administration that needs to see a decrease in cases over a given time period, something we haven’t seen on any timeframe. 

See how this works? Any by the way, while California, through extreme but necessary measures, has managed to flatten the predicted curve significantly, the IHME model continues to be slowly updated to its original prognostication that over 100k Americans will he dead by August. Last week they were predicting 60k by August 4. We’re currently at 62,300 deaths and it’s not even May, the model was updated 3 days ago to reflect a new expected death count of 72,433.

You're confusing long term deflation with a temporary price shock. And yes at the beginning, if people believe prices will rise again in the long term it will likely spur consumption.

The more deflation persists though, the more people stop having expectations that inflation will return. Nobody in Japan believes house prices will rise much these days, because they're still below their heights from 30 years ago.

If you believe asset prices will continue to fall, which serious deflation will do, then you wont buy that house, because you'll run the risk of being in negative equity."

Additionally, we did not see a massive ETF sell-off yet IMO and this will happen as the 20+ million unemployed in the U.S + millions in other countries start taping on their savings in the next months to make ends meet

In the long run, the risk (bigger than covid) is that we see increasing refinancings of businesses that should not be refinanced according to their fundamentals (zombies) since 2008 as the Fed has kept interest rates low for a long time. This also happens in the EU with government debt as yields are hitting all-time lows again despite rising debt levels.

There are some drawbacks to this though. Firstly, if you find that you've overinflated the economy, it's much more difficult than to pull that money back out again than if you'd just purchased government bonds. Second, you can't guarantee that the public will spend that money. In fact, if the economy is very weak and consumer confidence low, and the public think the government cheques will just be a one-off and not repeated, much of it will end up sitting in bank accounts for a rainy day, rather than spent which is what the economy needs (but might not be optimal for any one family)."

I think basket funds like that are a loser in this environment, you want to be more granular in your stock selection right now as there are obvious winners and losers in this pandemic recession— index and etf investing is going to take a back seat for a little while which we’re even seeing right now with all the cyclical trade (yesterday is a perfect example, big caps all flat or down while the most hated industries led the rally... oil and cruise lines and such). If you’re on reddit you’re too young to own any bonds, particularly with yields as historically low as they are... with where the 10 year is you’ll probably make more money in 5-10 years by buying a house and paying the carrying costs at 3% mortgage interest rather than holding t-bills. Bonds are just uninvestable right now unless you’ve just got way too much money and don’t know where to put it. Even guys like Gundlach are lightening the load in light of what’s happening right now. That’s pretty unusual. 

Cash is king right now and contrary to what our /r/wsb OP here likes to think, most fund managers are sitting on appreciable dry powder and waiting for the next leg down. Sure, the FOMO from this bull rally has undoubtedly caused some of that to make its way into names like MSFT and AMZN which are both back at or near all time highs or into some of the cyclical industries I mentioned which were hard to ignore on a valuation basis but the general consensus among *smart money* is that we’ve only seen the beginning of the economic impact of this virus and that things are going to get a lot worse and this recession is going to last longer than most people think (many analysts think we’ll see a recovery in q4 which is pretty hard to imagine as someone modeling the progression of deaths from the virus in this country in additional to my own anecdotal sense that a large swath of consumers are not going to be so quick to return to their usual spending habits even after a safe and effective vaccine has been widely distributed which will likely take substantially longer than 2 years). 

At the same time, on a longer timeframe, 20% drops from the high have always been been historical buying opportunities. What I have been telling family members is that this is the time to start picking at positions in stocks they can imagine holding for a minimum of 10 years. I encourage them to buy 10 shares at a time (unless they like something like AMZN, sheesh, I don’t know why anyone would want to trade shares over calls at its current price) since there are no commissions anymore so they can cost average over time. 

I think you want to be a cautious buyer in this market and not chase equities up. It’s very rare to bottom with as much positive sentiment as we saw at the depths of the recent crash, people were buying the dip with confidence. In my experience (I’ve only participated as far back as the dot com bust in ‘99, full disclosure) that a much more complex and protracted bear market rather than the v-shape recover everyone has been hoping for and what one would expect from an ordinary illness-related economic event. At this point the divergence between markets and economic data has made it clear that a real v-shape recovery of the economy is most certainly not in the cards so I, like most other professional portfolio managers, am highly skeptical of this rally. 

I think a 20-30% cash allocation is not unwarranted if you don’t have to worry about current holdings / unrealized gains or losses. I’ve been selling into this rally, it never hurts to take a profit."

2020-04-30 13:29:06,"Well depends - definitely can go higher no doubt because of this so it is something for a bullish case.

If real estate prices come down, which have been artificially frozen with transactions falling, I could see a lot of money moving into that asset class over stocks. The real estate market is very, very interesting to me right now. Some houses are still selling but what about commercial with retail and office... There is plenty of leverage in this market so it might be the opportunity money flows into. 

There is also plenty of systematic risk by taking on more debt, even if cheap. Take AMC - they explored bankruptcy but have backed off of it. That's not a high margin business and one that doesn't necessarily come back quickly. Maybe even people decide that they want to watch Netflix and there is a fundamental change.

Check out the equal weighted returns of the S&amp;P 500, retail sector, etc. We all know what has led this rally - large cap tech, FAANG, etc. These earnings are coming out now and look pretty good. Microsoft and Netflix obviously are great in this environment but even things like Facebook and Google's results showed this and provided hope for the market because ads are supposed to lag in recessions but ads are cheap and they have more users on right now, which gives a tailwind in tough times. These tailwinds aren't around for some companies that are riding on expectations on a return to normalcy and normal business activity sooner rather than later. 

For me - Yesterday, with Remdesivir was the first time you really saw and felt like the laggards were truly leading the rally. You're right that it seems to be enough... but what if it doesn't give confidence to the consumers. We see in China data that people aren't going out as much. This with zombie companies - like AMC - could lead to lots of risk. We will see that revert - and we are with small caps today. Until we see a continual recovery in those true laggards, there is risk, even with money on the sidelines, that we will slide significantly lower.

I'm not a market timer so I won't guess in the next 2 weeks/months what the market will do. I have a very hard time trying to figure what the mentality of people are. So I'm picking my spots to invest in some things. Maybe you're right and we rip higher but I think we are in a weird spot and it will take very little to spook the market not to the March lows but possibly quite a bit lower. Just like it took very little to euphorically rise us to this point. 

Though I do agree multiples deserve to be higher in this macro event so if we magically had 100% immunity tomorrow we would see levels go above the February highs."

Significantly increased money supply and lower economic productivity -&gt; high inflation

Low interest rates and high valuations / prices -&gt; low returns

Inflation &gt; financial returns and economic productivity = negative real returns and economic stagflation

Spirit Aerosystems (SPR): Critical parts supplier to Boeing. Stock is down from 70 to 20. Boeing isn't going to fail and people are not going to stop flying. The 737 Max will get approved to fly again in a few months.

OMAB - Mexican airport listed in the USA as an ADR. Down 60%. Again, people are not going to stop flying. This is an airport, not an airline. They have ZERO net debt.

Restoration Hardware (RH) - Was at 250 in Feb now at 150. Plenty of people sitting at home right now who want to redecorate their homes. Have an ecommerce business which is firing on all cylinders during lockdowns. 

Ventas (VTR) - best in class management team in healthcare focused REIT. Was at 60 in Feb now available at 30.

2020-04-30 13:23:03,"&gt;Some will want to debate the minutiae of the science but the drug is better than nothing and is a big lift to sentiment.

It's not lifting sentiment. It's adding hopium. 

&gt;Economic data appears to have bottomed in mid-April. 

Uh. We added 3.8M more unemployed today. GDP report yesterday was almost 5% contraction and the next report is widely expected to be calamitous. 

&gt;There has not been a major credit event and the Fed has backstopped the bond market successfully so far. It's anyone's guess but I don't see a systemic blow up.

There wasn't a credit event in the GFC... until there was. The Fed tried to unwind their balance sheet for a hot minute and the repo markets freaked the fuck out back in September. 

Excess liqudity has only forestalled the problem. The market is trading with frankly pitiful volume. There's a huge amount of participation that's waiting on the sidelines looking to pounce. 

&gt; Yesterday Powell basically told us he was not going to taper monetary stimulus for a long time. They're going to print for years.

If central bank printing was enough to overcome fundamental problems with a country's economy, why is Zimbabwe a meme? 

&gt;Most stocks I see missing earnings and pulling guidance don't react, indicating the market is willing to look through bad results.

Is that what it means? Or does that imply the market is no longer trading on fundamentals and is instead taking outsized risk based entirely on the premise that the Fed will be enough to keep everything pushing higher. 

Declaring that the market is ""past it"" when we haven't even seen the effects of the economic shut down is just myopic. 

You think 30M people can get laid off and that have NO impact on the market? PEs are so high, it's a wonder Jeff Bezos doesn't walk around with a permanent nose bleed. 

And none of this takes into account the fact that *every other country in the world is just as fucked*. Even if the Fed could just print the economy past the crisis, it can't do that for the rest of the world. 

And none of this has anything to do with the state of the virus today. This is all stuff that has already happened and cannot unhappen. 

Imagine if states ease lockdown restrictions and the virus immediately rebounds - like we just saw in Germany.

I disagree with that assumption, so I'm bearish. I don't see ~35 million unemployed Americans getting rehired as soon as everything reopens. I don't see everyone going back to the movies and taking international flights, buying things from retail stores, etc. as much as they did pre-Covid. That's just me. Now that people are learning to live below their means, and generally have less cash due to the crisis, I don't see consumer sentiment skyrocketing back to the 130 level anytime soon.

To me, this is less about the death counts and infection rates and more about the underlying affect is has on consumer sentiment, spending, and economic data.

OP, I suggest you pay closer attention to the Fed balance sheet rather than taking Powell at his word. The fed has been jawboning since early March but they’ve substantially pulled back in repo operations and bought exactly $0 worth of the junk debt and ABS they said they would.

They’re hoping barking will be enough to elevate markets in the face of unprecedented economic contraction. That only works until it doesn’t. I deal a lot with small cap biotech and I’m pretty familiar with the FDA approval process.... in any other circumstances, Remdesivir would be sunk by the fact that they completely changed the primary endpoint half way through the trial from looking at patients on an 8 point scale to looking at recovery time which seems to me a confident way to disinclude negative outcome. Based on Fauci’s comments, it’s easy to imagine that they didn’t see statistically significant benefit but it was close and there were no safety concerns so what does anyone have to lose? Quell the public panic and give the president something to be happy about which keeps Fauci in charge.

If you figure we get 2% inflation, cash is a -2% investment. Bonds will be say -1.25% or something, and then stocks if you assume they will be flat or higher then sure, but if stocks have even a slight down year, they won't be the best asset class anymore. Plus, once they lose their perceived best asset class status, people will sell even more.

You can't just assume stocks will go up in the short term. Sure in the long run like 10+ years yeah I agree, buying now is fine. But why would I buy something at 25 P/E which has downside risk? That P/E means at their current earnings rate it would take me 25 years to recoop my investment. What if earnings don't just pop right back to what they were?

Since when has the market just been completely ignoring things 1 year out and sooner? This market is divorced from the reality of this crisis. Yes, we will have a sharp bounce back in Q3 and Q4, but that doesn't mean we will even be back to even in GDP or unemployment or earnings by year end, yet here the market was yesterday, higher than before the 2018 spill.

2020-11-03 18:40:59,"I'm pretty divided on this action.  First, I think it's hard to argue harms, since Google has the better product, and has for a long time.  I'm very familiar with the other options, and all of them just are not as good.

However, it's hard to argue with the author's point about the virtuous cycle Google has setup to feed this, with better searches leading to more traffic, which leads to more searches.  I'm not really sure how you can fix this, and allow other companies a better opportunity to compete.

I don't really think it's search that's necessarily a problem here, so much as it is their domination of online internet advertising.  A lot of the harms generated from Google (other than their constant cancelling of products) comes from the need to make money selling advertising.  It might be possible to separate out their current ad network for Android and other places from the ads sold on search, and de-integrate that part of the company.  This could potentially generate enough revenue for other companies to compete in search.  It would also fix some of the sneaky stuff going on with their domination of browsers, and subsequent removal of ad blocking capabilities from Chrome.

What bothers me here is the knock on effect of a rule that prevents them from paying for placement of their search.  If this happens that is a death sentence for Firefox, since they derive a massive amount of their revenue from this agreement.  With the movement of Edge to be a UI around the Chromium Embedded Framework, and Safari being based on a similar branch from WebKit, that would leave us back where we were when Microsoft's IE dominated browsers.

Allowing one company to completely control browsers would give a strangle hold over the internet."

2020-11-03 17:35:40,"This is a good fragment (on why this is happening at all). And I don't think it's just an American habit:

&gt;What matters more is the context laid out by Letwin: there is a strain of political thought in America, independent of political party (although traditionally associated with Democrats), that is inherently allergic to concentrated power — monopoly in the populist sense, if not the legal one.  
*Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.*  
In other words, this subcommittee report is simply a new expression of an old idea; the details matter less than the fact it exists.

I am curious to see how they will tackle in courts that pesky single line argument of ""The competition is only a click away""."

2020-11-03 17:10:37,"Had to skim it, but I'm not sure how well Google's defense of paying for shelf space will hold up. If shelf space led to 1 major provider of critical products and that company had shelf space at every store, then it too would come under scrutiny. I never gave much thought to their search contract, because I always figured it was just to help compensate development of internet browsers that were otherwise free to the user. In the context of the antitrust situation, it doesn't seem so innocent any more and especially because it has held others back from developing scale.

I'll just throw out an additional risk... the lack of advertising revenue growth at non-tech firms has probably been one of the reasons that small distribution newspapers can't make it. If they, and other ad revenue based companies, are feeling similar pressures and complaining to their political representatives, it may create all the more desire to create regulation for internet advertising. This could come under the guise of protecting digital privacy and/or to promote search engine competition.

Maybe velocity of money has components driven by demographics and slower moving aspects such as people's view of scarcity. The other thing... she (I respect Lyn to be clear) has a chart of money supply growth, but I don't see the negative impact I expected from the removal of silver in the US in 1873. I believe this had an impact for many decades until around 1932 when it was brought back in.

One other comment... currency debasement is confusing. Back in the day, you could take the edges off of a coin and form new coin. If you put in 1 coin in the bank and then got back something 1/2 the size, you'd probably immediately tell your customers, ""I need either 2 of the new size, or 1 older."" It's a little less obvious when currency is effectively digital. (This is not a crypto comment, but just referring to use of credit cards, bank accounts, etc. as opposed to a physical debasement)

If the business is undervalued and profitable, you want people to ignore it so you can build up a big position. Stock prices follow earnings in the long term. If I had to wait 4 years for the market to figure it out, I'm fine. Edit: you say they'll do buybacks so this means you want the share price undervalued while they are buying it back. Last thing you want is the company doing buybacks on over priced shares.

2021-05-09 15:45:09,"Distributors get paid a bonus in the form of points for recruiting associates during their first 6 weeks as a distributor (refer to page 10). IIRC, their filings don't reveal any info related to the ""President's Circle,"" which is an exclusive group comprised of top-performing distributors (i.e., those who have an extensive downline). I don't think BWMX's model is predatory per se, but it clearly incentivizes recruitment efforts. Another example would be the gift prices: they offer catalog items (usually SKUs that don't sell) at a steep discount to associates, who can then go on to resell those items for a considerable profit (e.g. 1000 peso catalog item sold at an 80% discount). BWMX is essentially using associates as an inventory liquidation channel, and these associates end up taking the bait by purchasing these items - items that they end up giving away via raffles or end up using themselves because they don't sell. There are some parallels you can draw b/w the ""pre-reform"" Herbalife model and current-day BWMX, albeit they are very very different (BWMX sells products that end customers seem to like). In short, BWMX is a good business, but an MLM nonetheless.

There's a difference between getting bonuses purely for recruiting and indirectly getting bonuses because your recruiting associates leads to more sales, which is what you ultimately get paid a bonus on. You are implying the former, I believe reality is the latter.

2021-05-08 21:40:21,I lived in Mexico part time for over 10 years but its been a couple years since I spent a lot of time there. Like I said I have seen the popularity of MLM style sales there but I'm not sure if it was Betterware or others. Glad to hear its popular with the people you spoke with.
2021-05-08 18:50:05,"Yes, $5 is expensive in Mexico if it's not an essential purchase. Consider the average household income (on avg 3.8 people) of $16,000 a year. Minimum wage is $7 a *day*, assuming regular employment. Many Mexicans are self employed selling snacks or doing odd jobs so minimum wage does not even apply.
Transportation costs have risen significantly over the past few years with the state owned petroleum company becoming privatized- subsidized gasoline used to be $1 cheaper than in the usa but now it is more expensive because it is imported from the usa. Also look at corn prices increasing, corn is the basis of the Mexican diet and is eaten daily. 

This doesn't leave much extra money to spend on home accessories. Looking at the catalog, anything in it could probably be picked up cheaper at the local market/swap meet. So it would have to really be better stuff to want to buy from them. Since they have grown so much over the years, it probably is better. But I wouldn't count on radical growth in Mexico or other (poorer) Latin American countries.

I'm not trying to knock your analysis, I'm just offering potential bear cases from my personal experience."

Looking at the catalog their prices seem a little high so I think they are aimed at upper middle class families. Only 350 items in their catalog so they have a loooong ways to go before they're like AMZN.

2021-05-07 17:26:35,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I do understand their acccounting. Just because it isn't illegal doesnt make it less shady. Enron's Accounting was also legal, and just like Enron they book it mark to mark.

I think the converse could be true. Just because the accounting looks weird doesn't necessarily make it shady.

And I Respectfully disagree about mark to market. They don't really book it ""mark to market"". That phrase refers to marking a security to market based on publicly traded data. This doesn't apply for the commissions receivable, which isn't publicly traded. Its more like accounts receivable except that it's longer term. 

I can expand on how commissions receivable is more like accounts receivable than an securities held for sale if you need. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's because every year they grow their customer base, they are expending more to acquire members and their cash inflows members will come in the upcoming years. Once their growth slows, their cash inflows will eventually start becoming larger than their outflows.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is not how cash flow works if you have a proper stable cash flow.

Respectfully disagree. Let's play out a simple scenario. You acquire 1 member in year 1, then 2 members in year 2, 2 member in year 3, 1 member in year 4. Then no new members after that. For ease of discussion, let's say life is 3 years, LTV is 900, and CAC is 600.  Your cashflows are as follows: 

* Year 1: - 300 (paid 600 upfront for CAC of 1 new member and received 1/3rd LTV of 300)
* Year 2: -300 (paid 1200 upfront for CAC  of 2 new members and received 1/3rd LTV from priors member of 300 and 1/3rd LTV from the 2 current years member of 600)
* Year 3: 300 (paid 1200 upfront for CAC  of 2 new member and received the final third of year 1 member for 300, received the 2nd year's 1/3rd LTV totally 600, and received current years LTV of 600 )
* Year 4: 900 (paid 600 upfront for CAC of 1 new member and received the final third of year 2 members for 600, received the 3rd year's 1/3rd LTV totally 600, and received 1/3rd LTV for current year of 300)
* Year 5: 600 +300
* Year 6: 300

Total Cashflows for all years should be: 

6 members \* (LTV 900 - CAC 600) = 6 \* 300 = 1800

And this reconciles to the example I laid out to you. Year 2 and 3 was when growth slowed and it was the beginning of it being cashflow positive. So once its market share stabilizes, it'll be cashflow positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As long as LTVs &gt; CAC plus other expenses, the company is profitable regardless of churn.  
&gt;  
&gt;No that can't be said like that. There is only a certain amount of people that will use their service. If their churn rate is high, that decreases.

Maybe at more mature stages of the market. Currently, the market is growing quickly so even if you lose some members, you have others to sell to. 

But to directly address churn. This is something that they are working to directly address. In fact, in Q1 earnings, they talk about how they've been recapturing members that have churned. However, they didn't change the way they measure churn. If a member switches from one insurance product to another sold by EHTH, that member is still considered churn even though they still have an active insurance policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I would argue that most 65+ don't go to the website to check it, so if their insurance gives them a deal, a lot would take it. the fact that a lot of their orders come via phone and not online seems to confirm that.

Believe it or not, more of their transactions has been going through the online platform. It's in the Earnings Slides. You can compare the most recent quarter to earlier quarters. The argument for this is that as more people turn 65, the new cohort of 65 year olds are more tech savvy than the previous one. The numbers represent this and you can see the trend in our life.  The 60 year old guy working an office job would know how to use the internet for e-mails and browse the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Seems to me the risk is way to high to invest.

That's fine. Appreciate the conversation."

It's more convenient to go to a  marketplace where all that information is gathered and organized for  you.

2021-05-07 13:39:17,"Thanks for your comment, I appreciate your questions! I moved some of your sentences around below so I can address each question more concisely: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why would anyone not use Medicare directly from the government but through a third party? 

Because eHealth's website is better. See the link below

[https://www.doughroller.net/insurance/alternatives-healthcare-gov-coming-soon/](https://www.doughroller.net/insurance/alternatives-healthcare-gov-coming-soon/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As the government Medicare websites gets improved and online insurance customer seemingly having no loyalty how will they get to your price target?

Yeah, this is a good question. I would argue that this is a threat to eHealth's business. Arguably speaking, it's direct competitors (SLQT and GoHealth) have platforms that would be a threat to EHTH as well. So let me generalize this question to a comparison between for-profit entities competing with governmental entities. I think for-profit entites have the funds and intention to protect their source of income. So from this standpoint, if they need to invest to stay competitive and get customers, they will. Government entities, on the other hand, don't have this profit motive. They may update their website/tech periodically. But do you really believe that the government will regularly invest in tech? I think they are slower to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Their accounting is quite shady. Looking at their cash flow statement from 2018 they had surging revenue (maybe due to their accouting change), a huge drop off in accts receivables (cancelships and lost payments) so they actually have negative cash flow from operations and finance that cash flow by the sale an issuance of stock. Even with those sheenanigans they are far from cheap or good value. 

They are actually complaint with US GAAP and have an unqualified opinion from their auditors. I actually think that negative sentiment about their accounting is because the market doesn't understand its accounting, which makes this an opportunity for those who do. Here's a resource to refer to understand the rules and how eHealth is in compliance:

[https://www.bkd.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/Revenue-Changes-for-Insurance-Brokers.pdf](https://www.bkd.com/sites/default/files/2018-10/Revenue-Changes-for-Insurance-Brokers.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to take this time to point out that accounting rules don't always reflect the real economics of the business. Sometimes you have to make your own adjustments on US GAAP to derive your Free Cash Flow. For example, treating of Operating Leases in the past and the value of land. 

Specifically with EHTH, you have to convert LTVs and CAC to cashflows that you think are reasonable.  Let's say your member's policy life is 3 years. Then for each member: 

* Year 1 Net Cash outflow (Full amount of outflow from CAC and 1/3 of inflow from LTV)
* Year 2 Cash Inflow (1/3 inflow of LTV)
* Year 3 Cash Inflow (1/3 inflow of LTV)

So from that, hopefully I've answered why there's Negative cashflow. It's because every year they grow their customer base, they are expending more to acquire members and their cash inflows members will come in the upcoming years. Once their growth slows, their cash inflows will eventually start becoming larger than their outflows. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also their churn rates are quite high (in Q4 2019 is was 42% -  so 42% were no longer their customer after 1 year -  for an insurance that is absolutly terrible). 

I think you're focusing on churn too much as a key metric. In my opinion, it's really a second order metric. LTV's is the first order metric you should be concerned with. As stated in my post, LTV is derived from commission rates and the life of the insurance policy. As long as LTVs &gt; CAC plus other expenses, the company is profitable regardless of churn.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As they book their Life Time Values of their customers on Day 1 -  profits should be high, yet they are barely profitable even with them booking customer aquistions on a mark to mark basis.

It's reported positive net income since before they got into the Medicare Business so not sure what you're referring to exactly. If you clarify, I'd be happy to address it.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Furthermore the e-Healthmarket is very fragmented and new entrats show up every day (even if they are also shady like Clover Health). As more traditional insurance companies enter this space, what will deter them from just taking eHealths potential customers?

The market is very fragmented because it's a new and growing market. It only started existing in 2016 - 2017? Entrants are showing up because the total addressable market is huge and they believe it is highly profitable. The medicare advantage policies are actually provided to members by Traditional Insurance Companies (Cigna for example). But potential enrollees won't be able to directly compare plans at each Traditional Insurance Companies website. It's more convenient to go to a marketplace where all that information is gathered and organized for you. Hence customers would prefer to search for a plan on a platform like eHealths than to go to each insurance companies website.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;eHealth is not a new company. It is more than 15 years public and never be able to generate proper cashflow. I would say it should be 20$ or less and not 100$.

Yes, eHealth is not new. However, their management team is new, Scott Flanders started with them in 2016. Derek Yung started in 2018. Additionally, the current Medicare Segment, which comprises of 88% of Revenues, was started around 2016ish - 2017.  So for all intents and purposes, they are practically a new business. To further drive my point, the Netflix Streaming Business is a very different business from the Netflix DVD snail mail rental business."

Hi! I'm analyzing companies in the agricultural sector. One of them carries plenty of derivatives contracts, some are foreign currency hedges, others are commodity hedges. 

The thing is, I can't make sense of how they are accounted, how they are carried to P&amp;L, etc. 

For example, the company reported huge losses on its derivative contracts. However, I guess these are all covered contracts (were the company sold say soybeans but it had them of would obtain them after the harvest). Are these losses notional, non-cash? Like, if we hadn't sold these contracts, we could've won xxx amount. Or are the losses real, meaning they have to compensate the contract's counterpart?"

Warren's real reason for not doing stock splits all those years is so he could gauge with relative certainty that he is buying his own shares at the right time.  It's a real head scratcher, even for insiders to figure out where to buy back shares when you have a massive retail float.

2021-05-05 06:48:00,"Contra 1. IIFL has growing customer acquisition and average daily turnover numbers excluding the impact of the Karvy deal, which means there is organic growth instead of the decline you assume.
Contra 2. Even if we exclude the exceptional items, IIFL is still cheap on an EV/FCF basis and generates a lot of cash.
Contra 3. Discount broking is capturing customers but there are many who can't switch due to switching costs and stickiness. Reminder that discount brokers have higher margin and intraday brokerages for equity, F&amp;O, commodities etc. Also I believe discount brokerage customers pay higher spreads.
Contra 5. IIFL Finance is split off from Securities and the management is different. I wasn't aware about Finance's unethical practices but I will investigate.

If you research a little bit you will know why IIFL's fortunes seem to be declining. Many take 2018 as the base which is the year the spinoff happened so that's understandable. However, 2018 was the peak of a bull market in India, with lots of IPOs and retail interest. That market lost steam and for a few years IIFL's revenues and profits fell by double digits. Now they have reversed direction as another bull market has started and there are many retail investors who will be in for the long term."

1. Consistently losing market share of customers and trading volumes

2. This year's fcf is abnormal due to sale of some assets

3. Very strong competition from discount broking, a model IIFL can't pivot to as the IIFL group has a separate discount broking entity called 5 Paisa 

4. Current pricing model unsustainable. All discount brokers give 0 brokerage for cash trading, while IIFL charges double digit basis points. This will have to come off if the company has to stay relevant. Once the pricing falls, so will the revenues.

5. I won't go into the controlling shareholders' integrity issues (read about IIFL finance's lending and evergreening practices), but not the cleanest set of people out there.

2021-05-04 23:51:03,"&gt; The plan to consummate a merger is the latest twist in Hometown’s puzzling corporate existence, which began with its incorporation in Nevada in 2014. Barely a year later, the company filed for an initial public offering, identifying itself in a 2015 SEC submission as “the originator of a new delicatessen concept” featuring “‘homestyle’ sandwiches and other entrées in a casual and friendly atmosphere”.


&gt; That draft prospectus, filed before the Paulsboro deli opened its doors or even “fully executed” a lease, prompted the SEC to write a letter to Morina stating: “We believe that you are a shell company”. Morina shot back that the company had purchased new carpets, taken down walls and doors, put in gas pipes and wiring for refrigerators, and bought an oven with six burners, among other equipment — all to “accomplish its goal of [a] grand opening”.

&gt; Hometown began selling sandwiches in October 2015, but it would take longer before the public could buy shares in the company that owned it. Most of the stock was owned by Morina and his fellow director Christine Lindenmuth, who teaches mathematics at the high school where Morina is principal.

&gt; A few dozen financial investors put up $180,000 between them, in return for a roughly 5 per cent stake, in a private placement that began in 2014. Among the early backers were a state superior court judge and his wife, and several people who appear to be relatives or associates of Peter Coker, a North Carolina businessman.

&gt; Large blocks of shares have occasionally changed hands in off-market transactions. In March last year, shortly after he became chair, Coker’s son Peter Coker Jr bought a 29 per cent stake from Lindenmuth and immediately sold the shares to three separate purchasers.

&gt; The following month Hometown struck its boundary-pushing deal with an investment firm.

&gt; Hong Kong-based Maso Capital is in many ways the opposite of the meme traders that have taken stock markets on their wild ride. For much of the past decade, Maso has busied itself finding ways to help cash-rich companies in Asia transition to nimbler balance sheets. Last year Maso even launched a Spac, with Coker Jr as a director.

&gt; “We’re not afraid to roll up our sleeves and be innovators,” Maso’s co-chief investment officer Manoj Jain said. “We’re viewed as proponents of good governance in the region.”

&gt; Where Einhorn sees an overvalued food service business in southern New Jersey, Jain sees a way to control a US acquisition company on the cheap. “The concept of shell companies has existed globally for many years,” he said. “These are broadly quasi-dormant public companies, that can be used to merge with private companies quickly and easily.”

&gt; According to Jain, repurposing an existing business for M&amp;A is an efficient way to extend the Spac model to smaller deals. “The target companies we’re speaking to are in the $300m to $600m zip code in terms of valuation,” he said. “To get it to work from a public market perspective, the Spac needs to be $75m to $100m.”

&gt; A Spac has cash. We can value cash. The deli might have pickles and pastrami, but I doubt they’ve got $100m worth of pickles and pastrami

&gt; Joseph Grundfest, law professor at Stanford Law School and former SEC commissioner

&gt; Yet setting up a Spac can cost millions of dollars in administration fees alone, eating up a large portion of the value in such a small deal. “[Hometown] is a more flexible structure . . . with a longer time to find a target, and a better economic uplift,” Jain said.

&gt; “It works like a mini-Spac,” he added. “When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes, as the merged entity enters the US capital markets.”

&gt; Not everyone is convinced. “This doesn’t work at all,” Coffee said. “The [over-the-counter market] doesn’t give you real liquidity. All you get is the ability to negotiate on a bulletin board with a possible purchaser on the other side.” However, Jain believes that, with the right acquisition target, Hometown may be able to list on the Nasdaq exchange. Yet last week the company was pushed further away from the investment mainstream when trading venue OTC Markets attached a warning to its shares.

&gt; While some shareholders have recorded big gains, trading has been so thin that Hometown’s $100m valuation may be little more than hypothetical. Duke and Vanderbilt paid $1 a year ago for shares that were quoted at $13 this week, and investors who went in before 2016 have done even better on paper. Yet fewer than 2 per cent of Hometown’s shares changed hands in stock market transactions over the past 18 months, according to data from Senteio.

&gt; Uncertainty over Hometown’s valuation could yet thwart the company’s M&amp;A plans. “Who will want to merge their company into a deli and give them a $100m valuation?” asks Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford and former SEC commissioner. “A Spac has cash. We can value cash. The deli might have pickles and pastrami, but I doubt they’ve got $100m worth of pickles and pastrami.”

&gt; Despite the limited market for Hometown’s shares, Wall Street scrutiny has at least invigorated demand for its sandwiches. Philadelphia Magazine was among the outlets to publish a restaurant review last week. When the FT ordered a cheesesteak, a clerk suggested adding a $15 dollar T-shirt with the Hometown logo and the slogan “Eat so we both don’t starve”.

&gt; “I’m keeping your credit card,” said the clerk, briefly looking as though she might be serious. “And if you write a bad review, I’m going to keep charging it.”"
2021-05-04 23:50:55,"&gt; Duke and Vanderbilt universities, two of the most prestigious seats of learning in the US, are among the biggest shareholders of a company that owns a single sandwich shop in New Jersey and has a stock market valuation of $100m despite recording just $13,976 in sales last year.

&gt; The delicatessen in Paulsboro, a dusty refinery town abutting the Delaware river near Philadelphia, has attained notoriety on Wall Street after its parent company Hometown International was named by hedge fund manager David Einhorn as an example of the “quasi-anarchy” that he said had taken hold in financial markets.

&gt; “The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn quipped in a letter to investors a fortnight ago, citing Hometown’s nine-figure valuation as an example of how toothless financial regulators were permitting a destructive feeding frenzy. “Small investors who get sucked into these situations,” he wrote, “are likely to be harmed.”

&gt; Hometown has filed financial statements as a public company since 2015. Its shares are not listed on an exchange, making them far less liquid than blue-chip stocks; instead they trade “over the counter” through a network of broker-dealers who negotiate transactions with potential buyers and sellers. On a typical day, trades in Hometown’s stock add up to only a few thousand dollars. Yet the share price has soared, from $1.25 in October 2019 to $13 this week.

&gt; Unlike GameStop and other “meme stocks” that have ridden a wave of interest from housebound day traders, Hometown’s valuation was propelled not by amateur speculators but institutional investors. Among its key backers is a Hong Kong firm set up by up by veterans of Och-Ziff Capital Management, which sees its investment as a potentially lucrative variation on the special purpose acquisition companies that have recently helped to drive corporate dealmaking to 40 year highs.

&gt; It works like a mini-Spac. When you execute the merger, the name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes

&gt; Manoj Jain, co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital
Through a review of securities filings and public records, and interviews with key insiders, the Financial Times has pieced together this account of one of the strangest episodes in an extraordinary period for US capital markets — one that has appalled some experts. “[This] is a self-parody of a Spac,” said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University’s law school who has written about hostile takeovers. “And that is what I would expect at the end of a bubble.”

&gt; Hometown “has had limited success operating its current delicatessen”, a lawyer for the company told the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. During a recent lunchtime rush, three customers waited in a harshly lit dining room while staff tended the griddle and struggled with a temperamental credit card machine.

&gt; The company has excelled, however, at raising cash. Hometown brought in $2.5m in a private share placement in April last year, despite a six-month closure of its deli prompted by New Jersey governor Phil Murphy’s pandemic stay-at-home order. About $1m has already gone to cover last year’s losses, loan repayments and other outgoings, according to financial statements filed in March. By December last year, the kitchen was open again, with monthly losses of about $70,000 — and enough cash to sustain them for more than a year.


&gt; Duke university is one of the biggest shareholders in Hometown International © Lance King/Getty
Much of that money came from the multibillion-dollar endowments of Duke and Vanderbilt universities, which together invested about $2m. Both colleges referred questions about their investments to Maso Capital, a Hong Kong-based investment firm.

&gt; Now, Hometown plans to use what remains of the cash to fund a business acquisition that sounds as if it would set the company on a trajectory leading far beyond Paulsboro. The company, whose chief executive Paul Morina is also chief wrestling coach and principal at a nearby high school, is keeping an open mind about what it will acquire.

&gt; “We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location,” Hometown told investors in March. That phrase echoed a formulation commonly used by “blank cheque” companies, or Spacs, which raise capital on the stock market as empty corporate shells and use the cash to go shopping for deals.

&gt; Spacs are fuelling America’s mergers and acquisitions boom, accounting for $172bn worth of US corporate acquisitions in the first quarter, according to data from Refinitiv, and persuading emerging technology companies including Lucid Motors, a rival to the electric car maker Tesla, and the online broker eToro to embrace public ownership.

&gt; Although critics say Spacs are a lightly regulated backdoor to the stock market, which allows untested companies to go public with little scrutiny, the vehicles are gaining widespread acceptance. Still, experts say it is unusual for a business such as Hometown with existing operations to try to reinvent itself as a blank-cheque company, years after it filed to become a public company."

2021-05-04 20:18:25,If a company is messing with depreciation rates (I.e. lowering them) then they're messing with cash flows. If that is the case then how do I adjust the depreciation rate to get am accurate assessment of how overstated cash flows may be? Do I just take an average depreciation rate over a set period of time and apply it to their fixed assets to get a makeshift free cash flow number?

2021-11-16 11:41:25,Damodaran is an academic tool who tries to use theory to explain real life events. Honestly he should stick to teaching/research and stay out of discussions around actual companies and their valuations.
2021-11-16 10:01:01,"What the author is describing sound like an industry already at capacity, and then going over.  In the case of lumber I never saw any shortages, just a huge jump in prices.  Nor do I believe the lumber industry is facing shortages or working at capacity.  I could be wrong.  
That jump in prices came down just as quickly because most people weren't will to pay it, and waited instead.  I don't believe there were massive build ups in the system that will take time to clear.
So in one case we've got an increase in demand + increase in price, which fixed the demand, at which point prices returned to a similar level.  In this case we appear to have an increase/same level of demand resulting in a massive backlog, and increases in prices, hopefully leading to a corresponding correction in demand.  

However, the question for me is how much of the demand in shipping is inelastic?"

2021-11-15 22:38:23,"It was very similar in lumber earlier this year, prices mooned, and sawmills didn't jump to make significant efforts to increase capacity because they understood (being much closer to the moving parts in the system than we are as observers) that any long term investments made today wouldn't come online quickly enough to reap the rewards of spring '21 pricing.


We've known about supply chain issues for many months now (basically all of 2021 Odd Lots podcast episodes have been focused on the topic), while consumers might be surprised, if you're ordering parts/goods in size you've been over-ordering for months now and there will eventually be a buildup in domestic inventories that frees up space in the channel.


The implication that supply chain issues will continue for years assumes that domestic consumption will find a higher resting point than pre-pandemic and/or total shipping capacity is lower for longer. It also assumes that there is no political will to intervene, which could undermine the ""perverse"" incentives which are driving the global shipping magnates to constrain capacity."
2021-11-15 20:11:03,"For capacity bottlenecks, more incentive can sometimes make it worse.  If you have 100 people trying to cram through a doorway, it's not going to get better by making it 1000 people, throwing a bunch of hundred dollar bills on the ground on the other side or setting the place on fire.  There are physical constraints involved and everyone shoving for the door slows the throughout overall.  Motivation is not always the problem.  The solution to that problem by the way is actually to place a pole or barrier in the way to slow the pace down to something more orderly.

It may be the case that the reactions to the shortage are actually making things worse.  If company X buys up all the shipping containers it can find so it can ship cargo during a shortage, that actually reduces the utilization of those containers since they will sit until needed.

I'm not saying that things will go on like this forever, but complex systems like this can go sideways even with rational players in the middle and lots of motivation."

You need to increase the rate of offloading ships, but the containers will just pile up at the port because there aren't enough trucks to handle it.

Then you need to increase the number of trucks, but they'll just pile up at the warehouse, because there isn't enough warehouse space/docks  to handle all the trucks.

So you need to increase the number of warehouses  . . ."

2021-11-15 17:45:00,"What do people think about Vontier? It sees solid cash flows, sits in strong market positions, and its markets have long growth runways. Their D/E ratios are overinflated by a large, but entirely manageable, debt position and a lack of shareholder's equity as a result of being spun-off. Their reduced cash flow conversions for 2021 are a result of a FY2020 where the company operated on unsustainably low working capital caused by supply-chain issues. Seems like the high debt ratios and tough YoY comparisons cloud a company that is actually seeing demand growth for its newer software products, which lights a potential runway for solid growth."

2021-11-15 15:14:06,"&gt; That's more of a broader inflation issue though right?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think that causes some near/medium-term issues, but we'll see how much. There's already a ton of automation that was coming for those jobs before any wage bumps, and if those costs go up substantially that focus will be redoubled.

Inflation might be a general problem, but it can be very specific in some cases, like this one where they've already got one problem (back ups) and need to hire to fix it in a way that a place that's just lost a couple of workers and can pick up the slack cannot.

I agree there's automation coming for these jobs, automated trucks make more sense than automated cars, I'd think the same thing for crane operators at a port, but the question is which is cheaper.  I'm guessing it's been the human for a long time, but I don't know where the line/cut-off would be."
2021-11-15 14:59:35,"&gt;if the amount of stuff being shipped at the end of the day is decreased then someone somewhere in the supply chain is losing out.

The consumer and retailer is losing out.  That is why you see pictures of empty shelves in some stores and one of the reasons you are starting to see prices increase across the board."
2021-11-15 14:57:58,"If you operate at (example numbers) 90% capacity typically, and stop operating for 6 months, and then start up again, operating at 100% capacity, how long will it take to move through the backlog? 54 months. After covid itself stopped impacting port etc. operations (over a year ago!) and they started working again, well... They didn't work at 100% capacity. Nor 90%. Just 5-10%. The backlog is absolutely immense.

Building more chassis requires you to move steel to factories, which is very slow and expensive, because warehouses and transportation links are backed up and steel is at $2000/ton, so they can produce them. There should be no reason to have or need a single chassis per container anyway, but...

* they can't load goods in warehouses, because they can't get empty containers to the warehouses

* they can't unload container ships, because the docks are full

* they can't move containers from the docks, because their are no empty chassis

* there are no empty chassis because they are being used to hold empty containers they can't store on the ground

* they can't bring those empty containers to warehouses, because it's more profitable

A lot of these are caused by stupid processes (and regulations), because the market is not magical (but yes, also not fully liberal) and doesn't actually solve problems with more money, due to perverse incentives. Expanding the buffer size by stacking containers more high frees up a lot of chassis, and lets you unload ships. (Previously, 2-3 ships waiting at the port of long beach was high, nowadays you have 50+ (actually: https://www.businessinsider.com/supply-chain-crisis-record-number-of-container-ships-ca-ports-2021-11 ). Overall throughput across the seas is thus much lower than before.) They only started operating these ports 24 hours a day recently. Many stupid regulations. But not only.

This is why stocks like ZIM have a p/e of 1 and are making hand over fist. This is why steel has skyrocketed etc. etc. etc. /r/vitards has been profiting off of supply chain stocks for most of the year and seen the port waiting numbers go from 10, to 20, to...

-----

You talk about investment, but capital expenditure isn't always a good business idea. If suddenly everyone lay out billions to increase throughput, they will go through the backlog quickly and suddenly have way more capacity than necessary. This is the business cycle, causing booms and busts. For this reason, commodity and logistics companies haven't made investments in years - they were still burned from 2008. Even the number of container ships is much less before, as they decommission them without replacements, because newer ones didn't seem financially sensible (the market punishes unused capacity). And now, well... It takes a long time to build a large ship."

2021-11-15 14:38:16,"That doesn't quite answer my question.  A little more than a year ago this could all be blamed on a global worldwide event that was predicted to last 4-5 years until mitigation.  This year we're on the cusp of solving the issue in the near term.    


That doesn't explain a) why its getting worse and b) my original question, why this won't be solved in the near-term via increased incentives up and down the supply chain?  


Certainly, I'm not against deregulation and rule changes lets do it, but it doesn't explain why there's 1 crane to every 50-100 trucks or why the chassis/container issue can't be solved with more money."
2021-11-15 14:37:39,"&gt; Have you ever worked in a job where you regularly talked to blue collar workers?

Yes, and yes it's true that some of it doom and gloom.  OTOH, I've also noticed a tendency amongst managers to always dismiss the reports from the people actually doing the work.  I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle.

&gt;  For ex, do you really think if US ports are clogged and port operators are just bumping up storage fees to be profitable the govt isn't going to step in? Do you think port operators don't know this?

They have been pretty quiet about a lot of the bumps in life saving drugs.  The truth is that they've turned a blind eye to a lot of rent seeking behavior, unless it gets a lot of national attention.  If the port operators continue to fly under the radar like they have so far, then yes, I expect it to continue.  If the news outlets get ahold of it, then there might be some push back, but this is a temporary issue in a way that jacking up the price of insulin 3x permanently is not.  Assuming they do step in, it's likely to be long after the issue has been resolved in the next year or two."
2021-11-15 14:33:04,"I'll agree we're not coming out of this in the next quarter or even next couple of quarters, and if he said that I think that's a reasonable conclusion.

Things are messy as hell in the short-term, and frankly it'll probably take longer than my expectation to fully fix because this stuff always does.

However, what he's postulating as a long-term scenario would have a ridiculous amount of public resources directed toward it to fix. 

It'll be interesting to see what happens with shipping. Seems like we're setting up perfectly for normal boom/bust cycle in the industry. Baltic Dry Index is still ridiculously high, but has fallen nearly 50% from its high a month ago which is...hilariously absurd."
2021-11-15 14:29:13,"&gt; He's getting the incentives all wrong which is the problem with his analysis. Short-term there will be profit seeking, but this is 100% not going to be the new normal, and you'd have to be a fucking moron to think that's true.

Right, which goes to his point that there is no incentive to change.  I agree with you that he's probably not correct about 3x shipping, or that this is a new normal, but if things are as bad as he makes them out to be, and the system had that little elasticity, then it makes sense that we're looking at months or years to straighten out the system.  So to me this becomes a question of how long will it take for things go back to a state of equilibrium, and what that new normal will be.

Further that the areas where it needs help, more people, appear to already be under strain, so that it's going to be difficult to fix.  Which goes back to the issue with it taking a while to settle back.

Finally, while it might not be triple shipping, I'm expecting some rise in shipping, and maybe few companies offering free/subsidized shipping like Amazon does now."

Do you think we end up in a society where we're ordering Christmas presents in July at 3x the shipping cost and there's zero monetary incentive to fix that?

2021-11-15 13:36:08,"Also there’s just not that much elasticity that people even *would* pay triple shipping. This sounds like a truck driver who thinks like a truck driver, but the fact is that at a certain cost, people just don’t buy the widget or widget component anymore.

And to my knowledge there has almost never been loads of excess capacity in trucking."

2021-11-15 12:37:29,"Agree... the argument the author presents is there are basically two ways the ""boss"" can respond:

1.  Take advantage of the situation and start increasing revenue without making any extra investment (increase profit margin with no risk or cost).

2.  Invest in infrastructure and higher wages, meaning you may see topline growth as you increase throughput but you also have increased cost.  You also run the risk of shipping demand going down or normalizing as the situation resolves meaning you are stuck with higher wages/extra infrastructure with nothing to show for it."
2021-11-15 12:36:31,"I'm a little surprised by some of the cynicism in this thread. While a lot of the evidence put forward is anecdotal, I thought a couple of key points came across that aren't discussed that frequently in the financial press:

1. Trucking presents a huge freight bottleneck.
2. There is little incentive for truck drivers to transport goods to/from ports.
3. There is less of an incentive for port operators to move cargo than one might think, given that they can increase charges for storage.

These, taken in conjunction, provide a degree of support for an argument that supply chains are going to remain tight for quite some time. This conflicts with a lot of the narrative spun by analysts and/or journalists, who seem to be positing that supply chain tightness should alleviate in the short-run."
2021-11-15 11:48:35,"Can't really say without knowing the future. It does seem like the supply chain has been on a 40 year pursuit to zero inventory/just in time paradigm a reality. I would think there might be fear of building in even the slightest bit of over capacity.

Fundamentally it is about the rate of return on capital not the size of the return."
2021-11-15 11:29:16,"&gt; I'll be honest here, I appreciate the perspective, but I don't think a working grunt bitching about their boss being an idiot is really useful info.

Idiot like a fox maybe.  I got the impression he thought that the bosses were responding intelligently to a situation with perverse incentives result in behavior that was beneficial to the bosses, but not to society at large."
2021-11-15 11:26:58,"I get a bit confused by these takes (probably because I'm totally ignorant about who/what/how ports are run IRL).  If there's 1 crane per 50-100 trucks at every port union and non-union as this author claims, shouldn't the ports that manage to work around this limitation (or get more cranes) do the best?  Shouldn't the private contractors working at premium manage to resolve this pretty quickly (with less margin for vendors higher up the supply chain)?

Like to put it in a simpler question, to a logistical ignoramus like me this seems like a straightforward problem you can just throw money at (leading to higher near term prices across the board up and down the supply chain for sure) and it'll resolve in the near term (6 months to a year).  Are there reasons this viewpoint is misguided?"

2021-11-15 11:02:12,"You are correct in the long term, but it's not so easy to add infrastructure in the short term. By the time that infrastructure is in place, the inflation would have already passed. 

In the meantime, we're in for some transitory pain."
2021-11-15 10:27:22,"&gt; But it doesn’t hurt the owners of the transportation business — in fact the laws of supply and demand mean that they are actually going to make more money through higher rates, without changing a thing. They don’t have to improve or add infrastructure (because it’s costly), and they don’t have to pay their workers more (warehouse workers, crane operators, truckers).

??? And wouldn't they make even more over the long run if they did add infrastructure?"
2021-11-15 10:07:01,Did you read it? There's actually extremely good perspective in this.
2021-11-15 08:54:24,"I'll be honest here, I appreciate the perspective, but I don't think a working grunt bitching about their boss being an idiot is really useful info.

Of course there is incentive for companies to clear up the supply issues, so they can ship even more.

Definitely going to take time to work through it, but the notion that the existing problems are here to stay is laughable.

This whole ""shortage of truck drivers is never going to get better and will never be solved"" sounds like what you hear around peaks of certain phenomenon."
2021-11-15 06:48:25,"&gt;People who want their deliveries in a reasonable time are going to have to start paying premium rates. There will be levels of priority, and each increase in rate premium essentially jumps that freight ahead of all the freight with lower or no premium rates. Unless the lack of shipping infrastructure is resolved, things will back up in a cascading effect to the point where if your products are going general freight, you might wait a month or two for delivery. It’s already starting. If you use truck shipping in any way, you’ve no doubt started to see the delays. Think about what’s going to happen to holiday season shipping.  
&gt;  
&gt;What we have is a system with a limited amount of trucks and qualified drivers, many of whom are already working 14 hours a day (legally, the maximum they can), and now the supposed fix is to have them work 24 hours a day, every day, and not stop until the backlog is cleared. It’s not going to happen. It is not physically possible. There is no “cavalry” coming. No trucking companies are going to pay to register their trucks to haul containers for something that is supposedly so “short term,” because these same companies can get higher rate loads outside the ports. There is no extra capacity to be had, and it makes NO difference anyway, because If you can’t get a container unloaded at a warehouse, having drivers work 24/7/365 solves nothing.  
&gt;

2021-11-14 17:21:53,It all comes down to an alternative.

2021-11-13 09:34:15,"Progressive has long been an outperformer at rating/selecting insurance risk. I believe they had an edge (long ago) insuring individuals with DUIs, because they selected the ones who had children after, presumably a major reason for them to improve their life. I don't follow telematics in detail, but I don't think these technologies provide a *permanent* advantage to an insurance underwriter, because what it really depends on is how long it takes others to adopt it. Competitors might be behind the curve, but they'll make attempts to better classify driver risk. Firms like Verisk will want to provide the tools for this if they want to maintain their position as a provider of data as well.

The wildcard, which could provide a long runway, is that segmentation could become more and more precise over time to include factors such as traffic congestion levels on the routes you drive and the specific time of day. Maybe the vast amounts of variables will provide a decade of competitive advantage as Progressive rides ""the wave"". 

I'm not 100% sure though, because if you go back to the 1980s, the ability to segment risk that deeply was somewhat taken away before. In that case, it had to do with marketing tactics, because (some?) auto insurers were called out for only advertising (via billboards, etc.) in *certain* parts of town... technically, the insurance rate available was for all in the jurisdiction (non-discriminatory), but if you only put your ads on one side of the town, it's not made known to everyone as fairly and indirectly created some discrimination.

I'm not sure where the limits will end up. When I last looked, Progressive just wasn't cheap enough by my rudimentary benchmarks, and I'm naturally a bit more cautious about growth in areas like workers comp, which can carry long-tailed risks. I guess if anyone will do it well, Progressive has the right culture, but I can't help but wonder if it's a distraction from focusing on their auto business that they have managed well for a long time. If anyone here follows Progressive in more detail, I'd be curious to hear what you think."

2021-11-11 15:33:15,"Loan/asset growth is limited by growth in shareholder's equity, unless leverage increases (and it can't keep increasing every year). The bank could grow its equity by retaining earnings, and/or issuing more equity. So without issuing any more equity, the maximum growth in equity, in case the bank retains 100% of earnings, is the ROE = earnings/equity.

Therefore a loan growth that outpaces ROE indicates that new equity is being issued (or leverage is increasing). That is how ROE and loan growth are linked.

And for the sake of clarity, this is ROE, not ROE growth."

2021-11-10 17:37:23,"I think honestly the best way to get a good read on the type of content, is to read and see the types of things people are posting.

I understand you may need more specific rules, however, we can't add rules for every single possible situation. The best guiding criteria would be, is this well written, is there more depth to the article or is it simply regurgitating the same things that have been said many times. And also to ask yourself, what are you getting out of something you have read here, that you did not understand before."

*My background, experience, and expertise aren't in Security analysis, Investing, or Finance like many on here, so people like me who are also members of this community might miss a lot of the nuance you experts might have when doing securities research and choosing what to share with the community, hence the need for some kind of guidance in form of a rule.*

*So just as I could look peruse an article on Combinatorial Algebraic Topology and intuitively determine it is empty nonsense, is probably the same way you guys arrive at these determinations in Security Analysis. But for those of us without this intuition, some kind of guidance would greatly help us get better.*"

There's also been so much commentary on Tesla that majority of the new articles aren't saying anything new, simply a repetition of what they posted a month or so ago.

And to be honest, if you want to post these types of articles, that is totally okay, you can freely do so in many other finance related subreddits.

3. Directors can reject an offer on the basis that the buyout may harm the company: it's reputation, employees, etc.

4. Directors can reject a tender based on the quality of the offer. If the board deems the buyer is unable or unwilling (Elon) to complete the transaction, it may reject the tender. Doing so avoids legal costs that the company would otherwise incur.

2022-05-17 20:34:32,"The idea of an auction process is to ensure a buyer can't swoop in and get the company cheaper than its really worth. But a dutch auction doesn't work for that.  A dutch auction is typically done for buying some shares from shareholders willing to sell. You need an auction where the company as a whole is sold and all the shareholders are forced to sell, otherwise the sale has less value to the buyer if they have to manage owning a still public company with outside shareholders owning a significant part of the equity.

The typical reason a company is trading at a big discount to IV is that the daily (mostly retail)  buyers don't reflect full possible demand. Other companies interested in buying the target aren't buying shares in the daily market because they'll have to disclose well before they can reach controlling share position. They want to own the company outright, not a tiny piece. .  

So if you want to maximize value, the board needs to talk to potential buyers directly, typically by using an investment bank to approach all possible buyers which is starting an auction like process for the company as a whole."

2022-05-15 23:30:18,"**The Men Who Flipped on Bill Hwang Were Trusted Lieutenants**

* Executives who spent careers with Hwang turned on their boss
* William Tomita, Scott Becker could become star witnesses

Not long ago he was playing polo on the Connecticut Gold Coast -- a dashing young Wall Streeter charging hard for a winning shot.  
But on April 22, with his nerves on edge, William Tomita reached for the Xanax: He was due in federal court that Friday to plead guilty in the Archegos trading debacle and to formally turn on his longtime boss, Bill Hwang. Tomita was so distressed to speak publicly, he would tell the judge, that he had to take anti-anxiety medication first.  
Before him to the Manhattan courthouse had come his colleague Scott Becker, down from his home in Goshen, a quiet New York town named after the biblical land of plenty. Becker, too, had arrived to plead guilty and officially flip on Hwang, the enigmatic investor accused of masterminding a vast, criminal scheme to mislead banks and manipulate markets.  
Until that moment, Tomita and Becker were virtually unknown in financial circles, at least beyond the insular domain of Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. Now they will play a key role in prosecutors’ case against Hwang and Patrick Halligan, the former chief financial officer of the secretive investment firm. The once-trusted lieutenants could become star witnesses.

Few have been closer professionally to Hwang for longer than Tomita, his top trader, and Becker, his risk manager. With those two at his side, Hwang amassed one of the world’s great fortunes in virtual secrecy, only to lose it in a public spectacle of recklessness, hubris and, prosecutors assert, fraud and more. Tomita and Becker have cut deals in hopes of avoiding prison, or at least shortening their terms. Hwang and Halligan have pleaded not guilty to a range of charges, including racketeering conspiracy brought under statutes typically associated with mob bosses.  
Who are the Archegos insiders who’ve turned on Bill Hwang? Like their boss, Tomita and Becker have flown under the radar for years. Both 38, they’ve spent almost all of their careers working with Hwang, first at Tiger Asia Management, where Hwang initially ran into trouble, and later at Archegos, whose collapse last year sent shock waves through global finance.  
Despite playing key roles at Archegos -- which at one point amassed a staggering $160 billion position in stocks, according to prosecutors -- their public resumes are practically nonexistent. Neither appear to have active LinkedIn accounts. A Google search turns up almost nothing before Archegos imploded and made headlines around the world. Their lawyers didn’t return calls and emails seeking comment.  
The prospect of a courtroom drama replete with accusations and betrayals is bound to captivate Wall Street. The prosecution is depending on the pair to provide an inside account of supposed lies and deception. The defense will almost certainly question why Tomita and Becker have turned on their former boss. Hwang and Halligan are due back in court May 19.  
Jackson R. Sharman III, a white-collar defense lawyer, said one defense strategy would be to argue that the two cooperating witnesses are merely trying to cover up their own mistakes or wrongdoing, and that while Hwang may have lost a fortune, he didn’t intend to commit any crimes. The likely argument, according to Sharman: “There’s no smoking gun, there’s no fingerprint.”

What’s more, the Archegos debacle fractured ties between Hwang and some of his former staffers, who have fought to recoup deferred compensation that was tied up with the firm, Bloomberg has reported. Many Archegos employees were required to invest 25% or more of their bonuses with the fund and collectively lost millions of dollars, according to the US. Becker and Tomita elected to have a “substantial” portion of their money deferred, the SEC said.  
But the duo’s testimony will be crucial for prosecutors to obtain a conviction against Hwang because evidence in the indictment of his knowingly and intentionally violating the law “is exceedingly thin,” said Justin Danilewitz, a partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein &amp; Lehr and former assistant US Attorney. Without detailed independent corroboration, “the government’s job is tougher here.”  
Tomita and Becker certainly have a lot to tell. Both spent almost a decade and a half working for Hwang. Tomita, the son of a prominent Chicago surgeon, graduated from Northwestern University in 2006 with a degree in economics and international studies. After a brief stint at Lehman Brothers before the investment bank’s 2008 collapse, he went to work for Hwang’s hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management. A few years later, the firm pleaded guilty to wire fraud related to illegal trading in Chinese stocks and shut down.  
While Tomita wasn’t named by US authorities, Hong Kong regulators charged him with helping Hwang commit insider trading. He was cleared in 2013, with regulators saying he was just a junior staff member acting on Hwang’s instructions.  
Despite the close call, that year, Tomita stayed with his boss as he opened his family office, Archegos.  
There, prosecutors contend, Hwang called the shots and relied on Tomita to execute trades. Tomita also was one of Hwang’s primary contacts when communicating with about a dozen counterparties, according to the government.  
When not trading for Archegos, Tomita often played the No. 2 position on polo fields including one in Greenwich, Connecticut. With a half-point handicap, on a scale of -2 to 10, his typical job involved setting up goals for the No. 1 player and taking his own shot after a missed try.   
One player who practiced with Tomita said he came across as polite and deferential -- almost unusually so in a sport known for aggressive and even dangerous play. Tomita avoided big risks on the field, said this person, speaking on the condition of anonymity. After Tomita filled in for this player in one game, the trader followed up with a personal Thank You note.   
Tomita has also been seen on the polo fields near Palm Beach, Florida, where he has a white mid-century house hidden behind tall hedges that’s a block from the ocean. No one answered the door there this week.   
Tomita has pleaded guilty to five counts, including conspiracy, fraud and market manipulation, according to court records. Each crime carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. Tomita is free on $500,000 bond.  
At the April hearing in front of Judge Laura Taylor Swain, Tomita admitted under oath that, as head trader from March 2020 to March 2021, he made trades intended to build market power in particular stocks and used financial derivatives to mask the size of Archegos’s positions from other traders and from counterparties.  
He also made false statements to banks and brokers that allowed Archegos to trade on margin and convince them to enter into swap agreements with the firm.  
“I agreed with Bill and others to carry out the business of Archegos through a pattern of manipulating the prices of securities and deceiving counterparties,” Tomita said, standing and reading from a prepared statement.  
The day before, Becker had pleaded guilty to three criminal counts of conspiracy and fraud. Becker, who graduated summa cum laude from Manhattan College with a degree in accounting and finance, told Swain that he started on Hwang’s operations team at Tiger Asia in 2007. He told the judge that he lied to other financial institutions about Archegos’s holdings as part of a scheme to get them to extend credit or take part in swap transactions.  
“For example, in 2021, I falsely represented to certain financial institutions that Archegos’s largest position was approximately 35% of its net asset value when, in fact, I knew the largest position had grown to significantly higher -- to a significantly higher percentage than that,” Becker told the judge.   
“And when you did these things, did you know that what you were doing was wrong and illegal?” Swain asked Becker.  
“Yes,” he replied. Becker is free on $300,000 bond.  
While Tomita cut a striking figure on various polo grounds, Becker appears to have lived a quieter life in Goshen, a 75-minute drive north of Manhattan. His tan two-story colonial-style home, with warm red shutters, sits on a large, grassy hill speckled with spring dandelions. Reached there after his hearing, he declined to talk about his background, Archegos or the case against Hwang and Halligan.  
“I have a young family,” Becker said, looking over his shoulder into the house. “Please don’t come back.”"

I listened to this interview a couple of days ago, but I recall Powell stating (well paraphrasing what he said) that in hindsight there is value to the claim that they should have started sooner.  But that they only work with the data as they get it, and the data at the time showed they were doing what they needed to do.

It was a YES! moment for me seeing him admit that.  But on the other hand, it didn't give me warm fuzzies.  That considering the same approach he, and the committee, are taking to getting us out of this mess is the same approach that got us in this mess in the first place.

2022-05-15 10:06:39,"&gt;wages would still be moving up at healthy levels. They wouldn’t have to go down, but ultimately they would be at levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation.

How I understand that is wages aren't going back to precovid wages.  Rather from here on out the increases would be consistent with 2% inflation.  

So there really isn't any getting the eggs out of the cake with what happened in the past 2 years.  That cake is baked.  And I think the effects of this will take years to even out.  

There are going to be many more people still looking at their salary (who didn't already get a large inflationary raise), looking at what other people are getting for similar work, and either asking for a raise to get pay in line or jumping to competitors that already pay more.  Which will then cause more employers to raise product prices to accommodate the salary increases.  Or cut corners on product quality.  Or both.  It's messy.

It also makes me wonder if we don't end up with a multi-year period of wage stagnation as companies try to absorb higher costs.  And seeing how far they can get away with it.  It is such a complex matter due to all sides being squeezed financially."

2022-05-15 00:43:56,"There just isn't any other good alternative. Which is worse - painful inflation, or the global economy collapsing justifying a protracted global war which will likely involve bloodshed? The best we can hope for is an acceleration of what Raoul Pal describes as the ""Exponential Age"" - where real productivity from another Gilded Age might help offset our financial errors of the past."
2022-05-15 00:38:15,So really we’ve kicked the can into the future again and this recession is going to be allowed to be calamitous or will they once again come back to protect the market after x% drop?
2022-05-15 00:36:41,"Arguably yes. Given that we had already been at the tail-end of the credit cycle in 2008, and considering the additional stimulus from the past decade of ""Not QE"", US markets and the real economy had already become fragile relative to previous cycles - even before covid hit us. The reason why policymakers came out with such force in terms of monetary policy in 2008 was because we were truly staring into the abyss of another Great Depression *a la* 1929 - and we managed to kick the can down the road for another decade before the 2020's pandemic began. 

When 2020 started, we were staring into that same abyss once again *with even worse odds* \- greater leverage, lower growth, lower interest rates and a synchronous global recession. Basically the global economy was standing at the ""Whatever It Takes"" precipice - as evidenced by the justification to finally pull the 'helicopter money' taboo card. A Global Great Depression that dragged on for another 10 years (and possibly more) would have been far, far worse than whatever we could possibly face in the present day, and going forward - it could spiral into an actual Great Power war *a la* WW3. 

Given that choice, it was pretty obvious what the only remaining path was - kick the can down the road again, and figure things out later. There wasn't an easy answer (and there still isn't) *-* at this point, it's all about tradeoffs and optimizing ROI. Even the top of the food chain remains hostage to the whims of Mother Nature."
2022-05-15 00:22:55,"While I pride myself in understanding valuation and having a reasonable attitude and temperament towards investing, can someone who better understands macroeconomics and stimulus tell me whether or not this should have been done far, far earlier?

The insane run-up we saw in stocks... the stimulus happening for as long as it did... was it absolutely necessary to alleviate any credit crunch or whatever we experienced this time around? I call back to the 2008 recession where every talking head in business said if they didn't do what they did, the economy truly would have collapsed. Has every action to this point been as important?

I disagree with some of the actions taken during COVID but the Fed actions behind the scenes that are rarely discussed... was this all vital to keep our economy going, despite the insane inflation it caused especially recently?"
2022-05-14 22:36:12,"\&gt; So a soft landing is, is really just getting back to 2% inflation while keeping the labor market strong. And it’s quite challenging to accomplish that right now, for a couple of reasons. One is just that unemployment is very, very low, the labor market’s extremely tight, and inflation is very high. So it will be challenging, it won’t be easy. No one here thinks that it will be easy. Nonetheless, we think there are pathways, as you mentioned, for us to get there. And really what that means is just as we raise rates, we — so the problem, what causes inflation, is that demand and supply are out of whack. There’s too much demand. For example, in the labor market, there’s more demand for workers than there are people to take the jobs, right now, by a substantial margin. And, because of that, wages are moving up at levels that are unsustainably high and not consistent with low inflation. And so what we need to do is we need to get demand down, give supply a chance to recover and get those to align. So how might we do that? Right now, in the labor market, there are two job openings for every unemployed person. It’s historically high-level. So in principle, and I’m not saying this will be easy to do, in principle, you could moderate demand, reduce demand to the point where job openings move down substantially, and the labor market gets much closer to being in balance. And that would affect … wages would still be moving up at healthy levels. They wouldn’t have to go down, but ultimately they would be at levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation."

In exchange for a $25k up front payment and like $10m investment to fund working capital, SPACs create like a 10:1 risk reward ratio for the sponsor. It makes 10000% sense to do this as a sponsor if you can, especially when the market was hot and funding every deal that came through. Even if the stock falls post deal to $2 you still double your money as the sponsor. What do you care then about the quality of the target company? You just want to get any deal done.

2022-05-11 19:48:17,"Isn't it necessary to have a variant perception than the street on fundamentals for you to make money on a stock (ie it outperforms the index on a risk-adjusted basis)? Too often I see in fund letters talk of how they like the stock because of returns/growth/mgmt and think it's cheap because it's at a low multiple or whatever, but it can't just be that the market is offering a company with no fundamental issues at a discount for no reason, right? There must be something you believe that the consensus doesn't, and that's the only source of alpha I feel. Let me use two examples:

(1) Meta/FB: there is disagreement over whether Meta's heavy investments into the Metaverse for the next 3 years will pay off. That could be an opportunity for alpha if you in fact believe it could yield great returns because the street is currently undecided or doubtful. That's why FB is cheap.

(2) Google: I don't really see any divergence in views on the street on Google's fundamentals medium or long-term. Maybe some difference on 2022/3 numbers bc of recession or whatnot, but nobody is really disagreeing on Google's fundamentals (moat, returns, margins, growth, etc). So even if Google's multiple has contracted from 30x to 22x or whatever, why is that necessarily ""cheap"" or an opportunity? 

I don't know, maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way, but I feel the market is pretty efficient in valuing a business where there isn't much divergence in views on its fundamentals. Where the market price may be inefficient is when the range of fundamental outcomes is sufficiently wide, no?"

2015-08-21 10:00:52,"It doesn't completely resonate with me that this drop in oil price is truly a supply/demand thing. With oil I feel like price changes only affect demand marginally, it doesnt make sense that people are completely changing their consumption patterns based on the price of oil, I for one can tell you it has not affected my decision making much at all. To me, the price change has more to do with people's beliefs and less to do with actual supply/demand factors. If people believe oil is going up they buy driving up the price, if they believe its going down they sell and further drive it down. I see the price swings more of a perception problem. As an example I saw this with Jordan shoes, when I was younger jordans werent that cool, they were normal shoes and I could buy them for a reasonable price, perception has changed over the last 10 years and now they sell like crazy and prices have increased! its not a supply demand thing, its a perception change that has affected the economics of the situation."

If a company has $10 of current assets, and $4 in debt, then a simple liquidation value is $6. That $6 is worth it if you can get the firm for less than that, which is measured by the market cap. 

From there, you can do a deeper analysis of the situation. Read the 10-k, conference calls, etc.

You have to be cautious of the value trap situation however, because there's a chance that it's priced cheap for a reason - maybe there won't be a liquidation so that shareholders can realize value. 

In some cases, management will actually do what's necessary, but not always. Just be cautious going into them. Often times, you can get a *pop* in the share price on any kind of good news so investors can do okay in a trade, but if it's a real investment that you'll see through to cash realization, then the risks are more than I realized when I first got into it."

I really appreciate the link to the primers torrent. Despite being a frequent visitor to r/SecurityAnalysis I have never come across this. 

Thanks for the DHR recommendation. I have briefly looked at them before, but doing a deep dive may provide a unique learning opportunity. By DBS I assume you mean DHR's Business System? I am less familiar with this division/philosophy but will definitely take a look. Thanks again."
2015-08-20 11:05:31,"This article is quite well written but lacks much value unless you've had your eyes closed for the past 6 months. 

- Oil prices have been dropping so demand for upstream drilling and exploration has fallen
- Big companies don't want to invest more into this division unless it's profitable 
- The least profitable area is offshore because it is most expensive and is less justifiable at the current oil price
- There is now an over-supply of rigs due to the fact companies are reducing drilling operation. 

This is exactly what we'd expect when it comes to supply and demand. The supply was high so it covered the demand and competition for the demand pushed prices down. To compensate for the fall in price we are now seeing a fall in supply because it's not profitable to drill in all areas at every price. Hopefully this will satisfy OPEC members as international supply falls and they will reduce some of their production. 

The most interesting point of the article is the opinion that oil will not rebound and that this action reflects that. In my eyes the oil companies are being cautious. Yes you can snap up a bargain at the moment but the future seems uncertain because oil prices may not recover, this may be the new norm. Whether that's true or not it is diligent for big companies who already have an excess of drilling opportunities to not buy lots more upstream operations at auction. "

2015-08-19 22:06:09,"Here is an Einhorn presentation on Aercap, an aircraft leasing company.  Skip to 2nd half.  Similar model to banks and easy to understand math.  

https://www.greenlightcapital.com/926211.pdf

"
2015-08-19 21:17:33,"Here's a concrete example:  Imagine a company purchased $100 of assets (since we're talking about banks, picture loans).  These loans are expected to return 3%.  Imagine as well that these loans are similar to other other assets that you, the bank stockholder, could invest in by yourself (similar in terms of risk, however you want to define it).  The expected return on these similar assets that you could invest in personally is also 3%.  Now - if you only look at ROIC, you would say that this bank is not ""creating value"" for you the shareholder.  They are taking your money and investing at 3% when you yourself could be investing in very similar assets and also earning 3%.  No value add.  But wait - the bank probably financed the $100 asset purchase by raising $95 from deposits and only $5 from you.  Let's assume the interest rate the bank has to pay depositors is 0%.  The expected ROE for you as a bank shareholder is therefore 60%.  But if you tried to do the same things without the bank, it's highly unlikely you would be able put $5 down to purchase something worth $100 and pay 0% to the people you borrowed money from.  Let's say that if you did this on your own, you'd have to pay 2%.  The ROE you would get by yourself would only be 22% [ (100*10% - 95*2%) / 5 ].  So - Even though the bank is not ""creating value"" for you the shareholder ""on the left-hand side of the balance sheet"" (i.e. by investing the money wisely), they are ""creating value"" for you the shareholder ""on the right-hand side of the balance sheet"" (i.e. by raising capital at below market rates).  All of this ignores taxes and costs of financial distress (with no loss of generality)."
2015-08-19 20:43:07,"ROIC (NOPAT / Invested Capital) is a good metric for most businesses, but not for financial services companies (particularly banks).  Why?  Well, you first need to understand why ROIC is a good metric for most businesses.  Most businesses try to raise capital (debt and equity) at competitive prices and then use that capital to buy assets at below competitive prices.  Said differently, most businesses pay relatively competitive risk-adjusted rates when raising capital (debt and equity) and then turn around and try to invest that capital at risk-adjusted rates that are higher than their investors could get elsewhere.  All of the emphasis is on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, i.e. investing capital at higher than competitive rates.  ROIC measures the rate of return the business is earning is on what it invests; so it is focused 100% on what happens to the capital once it's raised - on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.  This is sufficient for most businesses.  Financial services companies, on the other hand, and banks in particular, not only try to invest at above average rates, they also try to source capital at abnormally cheap rates.  In fact, I would argue most of the emphasis for banks is on ""creating value"" via the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  Because of deposit insurance and too big to fail (among other things) there's a large subsidy given to banks by the government on the capital raising side.  Deposits are abnormally cheap and debt capital has an implicit government guarantee.  Only banks can raise capital at such cheap rates.  So banks make most of their money (i.e. their economic rent or value add) from sourcing capital cheaply as opposed to investing it really well.  Ergo ROIC doesn't really help in evaluating a bank.  ROE on the other hand, measures both sides of the balance sheet at once.  Embedded in ROE is the answer to two questions: 1) How well did the company invest it's money?, 2) How cheaply did they raise that money in the first place?.  So if a company (read: bank) is ""making money from both sides of the balance sheet"" the best metric to use is ROE.  Understanding this should also help you understand why banks have so much more leverage than most companies.  It's because the more capital they raised from ""subsidized"" deposits and ""implicitly guaranteed"" debt, the cheaper their capital is.  They're incentivized to load up on debt.  This privilege is only available to banks; so other businesses are not incentivized to load up on debt in the same way.  "
2015-08-19 17:53:58,"You can't use a ROIC/ROCE ratio. The best ratio to use would be ROE. Useful multiples would be P/E, P/Sales, P/AUM, Div Yield, P/B, P/TBV, depending on the firm. Depending on the firm you could use a gordon growth model or a residual income valuation. You're going to want to look at Cost/Income, PBT and Net income. On the balance sheet focus on equity and CET ratios. 

Financials are tricky because its hard to understand the balance sheet changes. Look at the company's statements and especially their presentations where they might emphasise specific KPIs or ratios that are useful to look at for their business.

I wouldn't say you need to fully understand the movements in the balance sheet, but you'd need to be comfortable enough with the business/management in order to accept that lack of understanding. I'm a generalist, but have done some work on and invested in some financials (buy side equity analyst)."

2015-08-19 13:01:58,"You'll want to look at the portfolio and analyze their exposures as best they let you with the information given.  For example - geographical and industry help.  Don't want too many high yield oil loans out there, or too many in the major drilling states.  If it's a bank they may tell you their ALM/duration management strategies in a call with them, and if you believe in interest rates going one way or the other it could be an added portfolio benefit that the street isn't accounting for.  On the equities side I would be skeptical of any venture capital investments that take up a large portion of their equity portfolio but I doubt we would see that with smaller banks too substantially, but similar rules apply as the liability analysis.  

Also, I've noticed that good management tends to prevail here in the deal-making process so make sure they all have a clean history."

2) If our shorts are going up and are longs are going down something is very wrong and we would move to cash. We monitor our exposures and for the most part both books tend to move in tandem. As our longs go up, our shorts go up we are just betting they go up less. As our longs go down, our shorts go down and we are just betting that our longs go down less. We are truly looking at relative performance in that as long as our longs outperform our shorts we make money regardless of what the market does. 

We spend a lot of time reviewing the historical performance of the companies and work at identifying what the key variables are that effect performance. From a management perspective, we like to review what their incentives are and how they align with what we feel the key variables are. Also, does management have a track record and what does it look like? "

Knowing this, when the market isn't favorable for us, we will cut our exposure in order to preserve capital. When it is a favorable environment we will ramp up our exposures. Our firm has multiple stratgies that do well when ours doesn't, so when we reduce exposure in our strategy then we increase expsoure in other strategies. "
2016-02-28 11:00:13,"1) Lets say your 150% Long and 100% Short vs 75% Long and 25% Short. Both give you 50% Net.

Now lets assume the market is down 14% and once again our alpha is 3.00% on each side. 250% Gross example would still be positive 0.50% and the 100% Gross example would be down -4%. 

2) Corret, we have 50-75 names on the long side and another 50-75 on the short side. So total is anywhere from 100-150. I have 7 analysts that work with me on my book. I don't get too involved in the day to day unless it is in the portfolio. Then I will take meetings with management along with our analysts, participate in earnings calls, and read the company reports. For the most part I let the analyst take the lead and I'm just there. We discuss the names in the portfolio on a daily basis and do a deep dive whenever something of substance changes. If the name spikes or crashes unexpectedly, we will review our thesis and the new information to try to figure out what happened. Our analyst all monitor a specific sector as their primary and another as a secondary, so they are staying on top of all the names in their universe. I only get involved in portfoio names.  "

2016-02-28 01:35:25,"Haven’t looked at ATW but have done some credit work for other offshore drillers (e.g., ORIG). Given their position in the industry as mostly undifferentiated service providers to the E&amp;P / upstream side of the O&amp;G industry (not to mention their very high, uneconomic break-evens) I’m pretty bearish on offshore operators as a whole. Even some of the bonds, which at least has an actual claim on the assets, are worth little more than the optionality value of what is essentially a vastly OTM call on oil prices. 

Some things to be aware of:

1. These assets are worth very little in true liquidation cases. That is, the actual scrap value of the materials making up the rig is very minimal. This goes double for aged fleets versus newer, modernized ones (not sure where ATW is on that spectrum).

2. If you’re buying here on the perception that book value = asset or liquidation value, you’re likely going to be mistaken. Don’t forget that book value is an accounting concept and entirely different than economic value. Rigs cost a lot (therefore creating a high book value) on the presumption that they’ll be valuable on a capitalized earnings basis. When these capitalized earnings go kaput, as they do when the service you are providing is economically unviable, then the book value you’re looking at is vastly overstated versus the economic reality.

3. There are very potent operating leverage forces working against you. I’m sure you know about value traps / the perils of investing in a so-called “melting ice cube.” With no contracts and high daily operating expenses per rig, this business is like an ice cube in a sauna.

4. Increasing revenue over the past 5 years means nothing, especially when capex has been double / triple operating cash flow over the same period. It’s all about looking ahead to the next 5 years. As a corollary to that, historic ROE and ROA also mean nothing. 5 years is a very short time in the context of a commodity-driven business and historically high oil prices.

Again, haven’t looked at ATW so this is just broad thinking about the sector. From what it looks like, ATW has relatively little debt compared to others in the space. But for me, it’s very difficult to make good predictions when the underlying security is highly dependent on something I view as mostly unknowable and unpredictable."

Alpha is what you deliver over and above the beta. Our ""alpha signals"" would be how well we really pick stocks.

Our competitors, while many are good stock pickers and probably better then me and my team, are unwilling to accept that they may be wrong in the short term. When the market turns agianst them, they will double up to catch up. Although that can work in the short term, in a sustained drawdown it can wipe you out. "

2016-02-28 00:52:27,"I read a lot. There are a few reserach analysts I like, newspapers, magazines, and our firms research. I talk to our traders, a coupe of brokers, and some analysts I respect. Listen to comapny conference calls. I talk to other PM's. I watch the news. Honestly, I have been doing this long enough that I am pretty much set in my ways. I know who I like and respect and don't really have to filter through the crap anymore. If someone I know says I need to check some dudes stuff out, I will. I have a lot of free time on my hands at the office unless we are doing an investor conference, investor call, or have an investor doing a due diligence meeting in which case I am on hand to say my part and then be on hand for any questions. I spend roughly 30% of my time traveling to conferences and spending time with our teams in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo.     "
2016-02-28 00:38:47,"Just depends on what you want to do. It should be an fairly easy transition. I mean, there are a lot of event driven, credit and distressed firms that would probably love having your skill set. Maybe a few long/short equity shops. "
2016-02-28 00:36:59,"Dang man, I don't know where the line is at. I guess once they stop responding to you then you went to far! I think touching base once or twice a week is reasonable. "
2016-02-28 00:34:04,"Not really, identifying the trend is really more of a mechanical process. Identifying inflection points is the hard part! We always overlay portfolio vol and when it spikes we begin reducing our gross exposure wether we are net long or net short. We use an intermediate term trend following model to determin net exposure. We didn't start using this until early 2000's. Our quant team had done some work and should me that it was a valuable overlay and added an element of long volatility exposure to our portfolio. 

Yes, I am frequently fully invested, its usually when vol in my portfolio or the firm spikes that I reduce exposure.  

I've heard of it, but haven't ever looked at it. I really respect Joel though. If I were running my own money or didn't have to worry about redempions I would follow a Gotham style model or 8-12 names and would rarely short. "

2016-02-27 23:31:01,"My teams edge is our risk management. Our alpha signals are very average at bets. We preform very well relative to our peers because we will adjust our portfolio's net exposure based on the market, similar to a CTA. When there is an uptrend, we are net long. When the market is in a downtrend, we are net short. When the market is flat we will reduce exposure because generall speaking our vol spikes. Our gross exposure is a function of vol. When they market moves against us and isn't favorable for our strategy, we cut exposure. 

I feel like having a mentor or mentors is invaluable. You are hopefully learning from their experience in addition to your own. I think you will eventually learn as much on you own, it will just take more time. 

Our process is very similar to Tiger. Every day it is either a buy or a sell. We don't have any holds. All position sizes are based on price to value so as that changes, our position changes. We will blow out of a position if it moves against us and we cannot exaplain why. We have a very, I dont know, combative process with our team. We debate things ad nauseam and it is a never ending process for us. You have to have thick skin and let things slide off your back. Its just business. 

I don't think the market is efficient, but I do believe it is an efficiency process. Burry is very, very smart. His process has worked very well for him. I don't like talking about my book. I have a friend thats an artist and she is always terrified whenever she does a showing because she is literally putting a piecce of herself out there and that terrifies her. I can relate anytime I talk my book. Early on, I refused to discuss my book. It was easy for me to question myself. Over time, that has become less of an issue for me. I guess I should add that I am completely transparent with investors and will give them as much information as they want, whenever they want it. But talking to outsiders, thats another matter for me. 

Yes, I have lived and helped build out teams in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. I still oversee those teams, but my main focus is on the US. Generally speaking, I feel the less liquid the market, the more oportunities for enterprising investors. With liquidity comes efficiency. "
2016-02-27 23:24:09,They have zero future contracts at the moment. Zero. That is why they are priced like this currently.
2016-02-27 23:12:42,"B School. Our accounting and back office teams have a couple of CPA's, but nobody on the investment side has a CPA. Your knowledge of financial statements would be pretty useful though. Do some research in your spare time, find some ideas and find a manager you can pitch them to. Demonstrate the value you bring to the table. You could be very valuable to a short only type team in uncovering frauds. "
2016-02-27 23:10:25,"Its possible, just not probable. Your best bet would be bringing something to the table. For instance, our energy group was trying to recruit a guy a couple of years ago. He had zero experience in hedge funds and private equity, but he had been the CEO and previously head of business developement for a large publicly traded energy company. He knew about deal structures and had contacts and experience that were valuable to the firm. "
2016-02-27 23:03:29,"Its not that they have access to sources of info the public doesn't, its the way they analyze that info and the conclusions they can draw from that. Right, our firm has entire teams of PhD's that do nothing but research. Their entire job is to make us better and more efficient. Portfolio management, risk management, trade execution, trade structuring, etc. We have another team that does nothing other than develop quantitative models. Everything from trend following to systematic global macro to long/short equity to volatility to HFT. They currently run 20+ seperate strategies and are absolute rockstars. They have access to the exact same info everyone else does and they consistently generate 15% plus returns with shockingly low volatility. The fact they haven't spun out yet is the surprising thing to me. I attribute it to the fact that they have no desire to run anything. They just want to do research and are happy never publishing anything. Landing them and building that capability out was a real coup. 

Some people and some firms absolutely have access to information you don't. In some cases, hedge funds are the ones feeding news the information they want them to have. Reporters are always looking for a story and giving them the narrative you want them to run with is not difficult. From there, you let them run with it and the next thing you know your rumor has now become fact. How do you think reporters find out about companies like Lumber Liquidators? Or when a huge firm blows up like Amaranth, Bear Stearns or Lehman Bros? When you know what their book is and they get a run on the bank, you can easily start trading against them, leak the news to feed the frenzy and then cover your positions as they are forced to unwind. That why you want to avoid the hedge fund hotels and always monitor your liquidity. 

My main sources of info are my Bloomberg terminal, MSCI Barra, company financials, the news, and some sell side research. "
2016-02-27 22:56:44,"Hmm I have been a bit too scared of shit like Ackman this last year. I definitely want to do 20-25. I think I'm competent enough to find that many good ideas :) 
5% is really concentrated still. 

See if I were to lock it away for 20 years I would invest in the equal weight consumer staples index, I personally think it's the most defensive yet economic sector. My favorite. 

Yeah clearly there are is some skill, but I think it's also the downside/upside. Lever beta the hell up, post a 30% return and 10x your Aum overnight, or the whole thing craps out and you take a job somewhere else. The downside/upside is really skewed because it isn't their money, hence its just one really big gamble. I'm not a fan of that at all.... "
2016-02-27 22:47:08,"Dude, if I were running a long only portfolio with a decent lockup so I wasn't concerned about redemptions I would run an 8-12 stock portfolio. Maybe some puts to hedge market risk. 

If I were going away for 20 years and couldn't touch it, I would rock the Permanent Portfolio: 25% each in S&amp;P 500, Long Bonds, Gold and Cash. 

There are some guys out there that are wicked smart and wicked good. Most are charlatans riding a leveraged beta wave. "
2016-02-27 22:45:14,"What's your edge? 

Thoughts on managing money under a mentor and on someone's dime vs going out on your own? Can you learn as much by yourself as you could working under a mentor? 

Does your fund mostly invest in equities or other asset classes as well? How familiar do you have to be with more esoteric assets/derivatives if you work mostly with equities?

Thoughts on conviction vs questioning your own thesis? I guess this is a question regarding psychology: how do you decide when to average down on a position when it's going against you? I read somewhere that Julian Robertson taught his analysts/PMs that a position was always either a buy or a sell, it was never a hold. If it was not a strong buy, at any given time, it was a sell, even if it was down 20% at the time. Would you say you agree with that kind of thinking?

Given that the market is more efficient now, would you say someone like how Burry was back in the '90s could still succeed just by digging through filings by himself in his office? Do you think it's important to have someone to discuss your ideas with?

Also, do you have any experience with European/Asian equities? And if you do, would you say the market is less efficient in say Korea than the U.S., and would there be more opportunities over there for the enterprising investor?

Thanks!"

I definitely think the US is the safest place to be, from a currency prospectice and have been bullish on the dollar since 2011-2012. I think we will continue to see dollar strength thru 2021 or so.

2016-02-27 22:00:53,"Great questions and I'll do my best to address them!

1) Our gross exposure is going to be 200-250%. Diversification is our first line of defense. We generally own 50-75 names on both the long and short side. We adjust our net exposure based on market trends, almost like a CTA which gives us an element on being long volatility in our portfolio. Our Gross exposure is a function of volatility. If vol spikes in our portfolio, we reduce exposure aggressively. Live to fight another day. We only play in the $5 billion + space so no liquidity risk. I monitor our liquidity and keep it so that we could liquidate our book in no more than 5 days with a 20% volume constrait. Being illiquid will kill you when you are subject to redemptions. 

2) We break out our universe into deciles by sector. Our long book is comrpised of our top decile names and our short book is comprised of our bottom decile names. We maintain a net neutral sector weight and monitor our factor exposures with MSCI Barra. Genrally speaking, even if you can add 6% of alpha on the short side its still a losing position because markets are going to do 7-10%. The flip side, is because we balance out our positions, we are truly relative in that we only need our longs to go up more than our shorts and vice versa. We haven't entirely removed our beta expsoure though because we are usually either net long or short. A sideways market is tough on us and we really really want it to breakout one way or the other. 

3) All I am looking at is what our analyst have come up with for a valuation. I compare that to the market price and then weight it accordingly. Net position is determined by market action. Gross exposure is a function of portfolio volatility. 

4) All position sizes are a function of price to estimate of valuation. If I were running a long only book and didn't have to worry about redemptions, I would run an 8-12 name book. 

5) Our edge is risk management and how we adjust our portfolio to market conditions. Our alpha signals are honestly pretty average at best. Our value is really that we are going to be long when the market is moving up, short when it is moving down, and we are going to reduce exposure in a sideways market. When the market turns, we are going to get caught, but less so because we are running a fairly balanced book and will only be either 50% net long or short. We add some alpha on both the long and the short side, but not much. Maybe 3-4%.  "
2016-02-27 21:45:52,Do you guys hire people who are not right out of undergrad or mba?  Take any people who worked in a different area of finance for a while and want to transition?
2016-02-27 21:40:20,"If I wanted to jump from analyst at a BB to PM at your firm, what would you need to see to make it happen? Career wise? Investment management side (like own portfolio with track record etc)?"
2016-02-27 21:38:54,"I attribute it to our risk management. Our alpha signals, if you will, are really nothing that spectacular. Instead, we feel like our edge is in how we adjust our exposure, both net and gross. 

For the most part, the entire industry is a freaking sham. Just looking at long/short, you can attribute the returns to two factors: long small caps/short lage cap and long value/short growth or to put it more concisely long small cap value/short large cap growth with a bias towards being net long 75% or so.

2016-02-27 21:23:14,"My 401k is up 2% this year b/c i a made a hard pivot to fixed income and treasuries. Is that what you guys are looking at?  

How are you guys looking at term structure given that the curve is so flat? "
2016-02-27 21:11:35,"Hey I'm at a long only and something I've come to be very skeptical about the long short strategy in general. I also have tons and tons and tons of questions. 

What's your gross exposure look like? What do you do to manage your shorts going against you and your longs going against you and then blowout of positions etc. I talked to a fund in town (not NYC) that blew out of their shorts to make margin call and now are ultra long in illiquid small caps. Obviously anecdotal but how do you prevent stuff like that? Is it position sizing/risk a management? Do you guys run a lot of positions? What do you do in terms of risk management specifically. 


Something I also wonder about is how you manage your long/short type positions. I find that when I look at others investors they have to take high risk longs to offset the drag of the shorts, which increases tail risk etc. What is your philosophy on shorting, my current boss is pretty much anti shorting as it is often a negative NPV activity over the long term, but I'm still open minded. All I know is never short open ended growth lol.

On another note how much information does it take to feel comfortable with a position? When do you think that is enough and feel comfortable to pull the trigger? 

What is your position sizing philosophy? Do you subscribe to the ""not in my 20th best idea"" or many to kind of smooth results? 

What would you consider your core competence? Like what situations have you found that you've really knocked it out of the park and have strong reads over. I think maybe 1-2 times for me I have found what I thought was gross overreactions to extremely high quality companies and then felt that I could size up, but what is your type of investment? Changing management etc all come to mind.

Apologize for what is a large amount of questions, but reading your other comments the results seem really great and would love to hear what you have to say! Take your time.

2016-02-27 20:52:24,"Its all based on what our estimate of fair value vs market price. If we think its worth $180 and its trading at $90, its going to get a pretty good weight in the portfolio but its all based on what else is available at that time. The most attractive risk/reward opportunities get the biggest weight.  "
2016-02-27 20:42:29,"Our firm is over $5 billion AUM. 

My percent changes based on volatility. As the vol spikes, we reduce our exposures. Currently, my gross exposure is a little over $1.5 billion. Generally speaking I manage 15% of the total AUM, but my gross exposure will be 200-250%. 

Sell side isn't a major impact in my day to day decision making. I like a couple of the big picture analyst/strategist and read David Rosenberg and Jan Hatzius for example. If one of my analyst is adamant that we blow out of a position, I'll challenge them, but will most likely go with their recommendation. Usually, the only time we blow out though is as a result of the market. Something happens that we cannot explain. 

Our tunrover is high because we trade around positions daily, but our average holding period for a stock would be around 2-3 years. Thats usually a result of more attractive names becoming available. All our position sizing is a result of the risk/reward or price/value if you prefer. "

2016-02-27 20:14:58,"We keep our book balanced, so we always have short positions to offeset our longs. Because we are long/short we only care about relative performance, that are longs go up more than our shorts and are shorts go down more than our longs. Each analyst is assigned a sector and maintains both a long and short list of names along with his estimate of valuation. If you take the Russell 1000 as a universe, we would only be interested in 20% of the names, the top 10% and the bottom 10% of price to value by sector. Once a name falls out of that decile, we remove it from the watchlist and replace it. Position size is determined by price/value and changes daily. As a short position climbs in value, we would add to the position. As it falls, we would reduce the position. If it spikes and we can't figure out why, we would blow out of the position becuase there is something going on that we don't know. Our time horizon is usually 3-5 years, but sometimes things happen sooner and sometimes it takes longer. Our risk management is all about reducing our CDaR. As the portfolio vol spikes, we cut exposures. If our vol isn't spiking, we adjust to the market. If the market is uptrending, we are net long. If its downtrending, we are net short. If the market is trading sideways we will maintain a neutral to net long bias. If a position spikes on us, we try to figure out why and if we can't rationally explain it, we blow out in a hurry. "

2016-02-27 19:43:35,"We try to remain neutral on our sector exposures. One theme we are biased towards right now though is the consumer. We think the consumer is stronger than they are getting credit for. Gasoline prices alone should account for an additional $300-400 in their pocket vs a couple of years ago and I don't think they can save it. Its going to get spent. 

Dude, I callled the internet bubble about 7 times before I was finally right! I called the mortgage/housing crisis about 15 times before I was right! The biggest lesson I have learned is that you don't want to fight the market. I am very much a fundamental investor at heart and always will be. That being said, I don't fight the market. If its in a downtrend I am going to be net short. If it's in an uptrend, I'm going to be net long. If my volatility is spiking, I'm cutting exposure and collapsing my book. Always manage your downside and the upside will mostly take care of itself. "
2016-02-27 19:37:44,"How do you run the short book different from the long book? For sure, the types of companies in the short book would be very different. My question is more about a) tactically determining when to initiate a position b) how do you go about building the position (short more on rises or on declines?) c) eventual position size on a short compared to a long d) typical time horizon for a short compared to a long e) any risk management that is different for the short book. Would appreciate your insights. Thanks!"
2016-02-27 19:34:41,"haha Yeah, but I'm biased. Our flagship fund is designed to be a LIBOR + 5-7% type product with very low volatility. There is also a 2x version of that. We offer some other products as well, but those two are the biggest by assets. Our group has done well, we were down 5% in 2008 and that has been the only down year since I started trading here back in 1999. 2008 was brutal, everything went down so unless you were net short you didn't make any money. Our risk controls both saved us and hurt us that year. They saved us becasue we ended up going to cash when volatility spiked, but they hurt us because instead of going net short we stayed in cash. Redemptions were a bitch as well. After some funds started putting their gates up, investors started looking for money anywhere they could get it and we were liquid. "
2016-02-27 19:26:19,"2015 was a decent year for us. Our group was up 11% and the firm as a whole finished up 6% and change for the year net of fees. So far this year, our group is up 2% or so and the firm is flat for the year. "

2016-06-01 15:15:50,"And what if that price made the deal no longer attractive to the buyer? Can they back out?

I don't know, it seems like a weird arrangement to me. I thought that was just part of it; you got a vote but you weren't guaranteed you get an outcome you liked if the majority went the other way. Just like in any other vote. 

Doesn't this incentivize people to vote against a popular vote so they can sue and try for a higher valuation?"
2016-06-01 15:06:15,Shareholders who voted to accept the buyout get no additional compensation. Any additional compensation from appraisal rights cases are awarded only to the dissenting shareholders who pursued the company in court.

The government isn't necessarily ""telling"" anybody anything.  The court heard cases from both sides (neither side was ""the government""), and ruled in favor of one (which often happens in court).

Obviously, the evidence in the case pointed to a higher valuation.  Of course, this could be adjusted/thrown out on appeal but remember, appeals are over procedures only - they do not exist simply as another avenue to which one can petition for a better outcome."

2016-05-31 17:41:19,There's probably better things for a competitor to invest in....that wouldn't gain them any market share. Once the NOLs were eliminated the stock would probably fall so that would hurt the competitor as well.
2016-05-31 14:46:23,"Sounds like the rights themselves are outstanding:

    ""the Board declared a non-taxable dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of the Company's common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2016""

but the rights are only exercisable once someone buys &gt;= 4.99% of the common (and they would be exercised automatically):
      
    ""The issuance of rights ... cause(s) a significant dilution upon any person or group that acquires ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without the prior approval of the Company's Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions""

My understanding is that the company would exercise everyone's rights BUT the 5% s/h's rights, which would dilute the 5% owner.


I don't think I'd get too caught up in the details of this. Nothing really changes in the capital structure for now and anyone w/ enough money to buy 5% of the company would typically have at least a conversation or two w/ the company b/f they got to that point and they'd understand the implications of their actions. (A violation by someone would be to your benefit b/c they get diluted.)

2016-05-31 11:07:39,"Speculating: 

I would assume the first category was just intrinsically cheap companies and the second category was cheap relative to other companies of the same type.  The first category is fairly self-explanatory.  However, you can imagine a company that isn't necessarily that cheap to take out value, but is cheaper than all the other ones in its category.  I.e., Buffett might not think it is very cheap to how much it was worth (or maybe not a ""steep"" discount), but does think it is the cheapest of a group (i.e., if it were priced with the group, it would be valued higher).  

I imagine he would advise not to pay attention to that second category if you asked him now though."

2016-05-30 17:39:22,"In general, any widely-used model for valuing the equity of a bank or bank holding company implicitly assumes that their assets of the bank are essentially *normal* since they all assume the target's portfolio is of average type, duration, concentration, allocation, ect. If any of these factors vary from their peer averages by a significant amount (say 2+ stnd dev) then **you should definitely address these factors individually**. A complete analysis should explain why the model is still valid or why your model adjs make your estimate sufficiently valid.

There are a lot of potential situations given bank size, deposit mix/size, country, ect that may make the above impossible. I would still try to acknowledge them. As for data, you really need to give more info for applicable advice. I think there are 30+ distinct markets there"
2016-05-30 16:20:51,"&gt; may not be so risk-averse (or put differently, you can lose money, given the right risk/reward opportunity). However, I think Buffett recommends the golden rule #1 Don't lose money because most investors (individual and institutional) don't realize how costly a severe loss to principal is to long-term returns. See example #1 below.
That's a long-winded way of saying that I think Buffett's writing/quotes are extremely useful, but you need to decipher them from his POV and apply them to your situation. They are definitely open to a wide-range of interpretations.

If your African bank has a John Stumpf-like at the helm, modest leverage, lower operating costs and better earnings on assets than competitors, you're on something. 

Data and core capital ratios are of second importance. Greek banks were technically the best capitalized in Europe before they went bust last year.  As about the loan book, you never know what's rotten in there before it actually surfaces.

Focus on management, cost structure, earnings on assets. Conservative investors pay 5x earnings for a well-run bank. You may accept to pay more if you believe there's significant growth ahead. "

2016-05-29 10:34:09,"Besides the excellent points made by /u/LetsTalkMarkets, I tend to look at the principle he is communicating to be: put a value to your own time as well.  

Some industries make immediate sense to us by virtue of our experiences and/or background.  We may need to study a lot to understand other industries.

The time you take to get caught up with a new industry is a cost that you must bear.  Making investments in industries that you already understand however means that you are maximizing your ability to get a return on the time you would spend on them."
2016-05-29 10:31:22,"&gt; If the market discount rate is 15% wouldn't we want to look for P/E below 6.6 to justify taking the risk? 

Yes, I would require a margin of safety.

&gt; I guess this is where I am confused, considering such high growth expectations to justify the p/e at this point wouldnt it be considered growth investing?

Its just an example of the relationship between P/E and growth. If you pay a high P/E than ask the reverse question: At a such a P/E the company has to grow 11% until infinity? The long term macro productivity gain is just 3% so the 11% are not sustainable. It has to grow faster than 11% up until a point in the future and than 3%  until infinity. Is that realistic?

&gt; Correct me if I am wrong to justify that P/E there is not a lot of room for multiple expansion and the only way that you would stand to profit would be dependence on the continued growth and subsequent price increase of the security based on that growth.

yes you are right. If you buy at high P/E you already brought future growth, which has yet to realize!

Growth investing can be value investing, but not all growth investing is value investing. Think about this example of uncertain growth: A bank in Silicon Valley provides debt for start ups. It issues debt conservatively to start-ups and requires collateral and (some) options in the the start up it finances. The bank is fairly valued at ~1.1 P/B. 2 cases can happen. The start ups go bankrupt and the bank gets collateral, resulting recovering the debt and resulting in no change of the P/B. 2nd case, the start ups grow and get sold, than the bank gets the options paid out. In that case the bank should be valued higher than 1.1 P/B. So even if you buy at fair 1.1 P/B, it can be a value investing, because the risk is very small whereas the gains are enormous.

&gt;  discount rate is the risk one is paid for taking on the security vs more secure equities

Yes, the discount rate = risk free rate + equity risk premium. For less secure companies you require a higher equity risk premium which results in a higher discount rate. The risk free rate does not change.

&gt;  intelligent investor 

In my opinion every value investor should have read it, but it is basically irrelevant right now. There are not many NetNets out there. There are much better books out there: ""Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond (Wiley Finance)"", ""The Little Book That Builds Wealth"", ""The Little Book of Valuation: How to Value a Company, Pick a Stock and Profit"", ""Deep Value: Why Activist Investors and Other Contrarians Battle for Control of Losing Corporations"", Read yourself into the concept of ROIC and being able to calculate it based on an annual report given to you."

2016-05-28 15:57:04,"Absolutely and I think there's are really useful (maybe important) points to make. I think my strategy used to be riddled with hidden risks that consistently caused me to underperform when expected returns and my research process was incredibly inefficient.

Maybe I did a bad job but I was hoping to convey that I think a large portion of returns for an investor of individual stocks is due to where they choose to expand their competence (research). No matter how analysts one has, decision makers can only have a limited percentage of the available, useful equity-related information. Investment research has uncertainty properties. The more in-depth you research a company, the smaller your circle of competence (""CC""). The minimum time to broaden your CC =&gt; understanding everything is impossible. I think another reason WEB avoided uncertain or poor-return industries is due to the limitations on time and the time required to adequately understand.

An individual investor can probably keep up with no more than 100 companies, assuming they put ~40 hours/week into the endeavor (time it takes to read reports, company-related news, create model, ect). Most can probably only handle 10-20. If your time is severely limited, assuming one adequately researches an investment, why would someone focus on companies they *can't* hold for at least a few years? If you lower your business-, industry-, or management-quality standards then you can safely assume that some meaningful % of companies you research *shouldn't* be invested in (if that's 50% then think if all the inefficient research hours!).

I personally follow roughly 50 companies very closely, another 100 companies on a high-level, conversant, basis. All have top-quintile-type business models and are in attractive industries. I occasionally invest in Graham-style deep value stocks. I research them in a one-off basis and have very high standards (most of them I research, I turn down - so they really aren't very helpful to overall returns). 

I have been sticking to this research process/methodology for 4+ years and I think it has had a substantial effect on returns (I make that judgement based on the quality of my returns, accuracy/hit-rate, ect)."

2016-05-28 15:36:29,"Thanks for the detailed reply. And I think you're right about Buffett's definition of ""understand"" being more about the inability to confidently project cash flows out 5-10 years.

But even still, when we know that Buffett reads some of the same annual reports every year (he said he read Anheiser Busch for 35 years before buying a share) that there have to be some publicly traded companies that he just doesn't look at right? Even a 10-Q is 100 pages, so if all you did was just read one 10-Q from all 4,000 stocks traded on the NYSE, then you'd read 400,000 pages per year, which is &gt; 1,000 pages per day. So if he's averaging 80 pages per day, that means he's **not** reading a majority of the SEC fillings. I know this is kind of a silly point, but we still have to acknowledge that there is just way too much information out there to even touch 1% of it, you have to pick and choose where to devote your time.

2016-05-28 14:47:30,Insurance is not hard to understand operationally. Brk's strength is mostly in capital discipline.

&gt;  Lets assume for simplicity that Earnings is equal to Owners Earnings. The ROIC tells me that the company generates 15% long term on my assets (after maintenance capex and no growth) which equals the market discount rate of 15%. With a market discount rate of 15% than we have a P/E of 6.6 (1/15%) and we are indifferent to invest or not.

If the market discount rate is 15% wouldn't we want to look for P/E below 6.6 to justify taking the risk? 
&gt; Now we add growth for the next year to justify P/E 25: 25/6.6 = 380%. Now the company has to grow until next year by 380% and then no growth to justify its 25 P/E (without additional capital) or 11% yearly growth until infinity (DCF Terminal Value: 25 = 1/(15%-11%)) or 100% the next year and then around 9.5% until infinity. Do your DCF experiments here. Get fluent with shifting growth back and forth the years.

I guess this is where I am confused, considering such high growth expectations to justify the p/e at this point wouldnt it be considered growth investing? Correct me if I am wrong to justify that P/E there is not a lot of room for multiple expansion and the only way that you would stand to profit would be dependence on the continued growth and subsequent price increase of the security based on that growth. 
&gt;A second source of high multiple is the discount rate. To justify an P/E of 25 just use a discount rate of 5% and growth until infinity of 1% and then you justified an P/E of 25 = 1/(5%-1%).
Traditionally the discount rate is defined as discount rate = risk free + equity risk premium. As central banks suppress risk free rate to 0% and below all the multiples get distorted. Investors chase yield thereby suppress equity risk premiums even further. The whole (market) discount rate is very distorted right now.


So the discount rate is the risk one is paid for taking on the security vs more secure equities. Where it makes perfect sense to apply 15%. If I do that a P/E of 7.14 makes sense assuming 1% growth (PE 7.74=1/(.15-.01)). 

I guess what I am confused about after reading the intelligent investor is that historically equity returns have been due to the underlying increase in price of the security vs the yield compared to bonds. If I am already paying handsomely for growth that may or may not occur coupled with p/e ratio that may not provide a lot of room for expansion I would think that I am buying the security at a premium where I am unlikely to see large gains and where I am taking on a number of additional risks that I am not being compensated for adequately. "
2016-05-28 13:18:07,"Buffett said he read the 10Ks of IBM for fifty years before 'getting it'. 

The quote, in my view, is more about understanding competitive advantages. You don't need to understand the engineering behind a carrier's network to understand the value of its business. 

And your circle of competence will be different from someone's else. I agree with you on oil. Too complex for me and too many risks I'm too uncertain about. "
2016-05-28 12:51:55," I think the overarching factor is that time is a commodity and it really comes down to opportunity costs. Buffett and Munger have been doing this for so long; so they know what industries are in their circle and what isn't, simple as that.


Personally, I don't see its as valuable to look into these more complex industries (a la oil/semi-conductors). When there are soooo many other stocks to look at (with much simpler business models), that offer a good risk/reward, or better.

Buffett reads 10k's/q's as well as newspaper (WSJ, FT) and relevant trade magazines (American Banker, Forbes) everyday. Probably has read the Netflix 10K, but I'd be surprised if he actually did an in-depth analysis beyond face value. "
2016-05-28 12:29:11,"Yeah, it's a problem I have with almost all of the books out there about Warren Buffett. Full of aphorisms about Mr. Market and ""long term sustainable economic moats"" but nothing about the technical details of his operating businesses. Even reading his annual letters, you get no sense of *why* General Re outperformed its competitors, other than ""we have disciplined underwriting practices."" What does this mean?"
2016-05-28 12:12:27,"My recommendation is to think in absolute $. You get a much better feeling for a business. An essential is to learn P/L, balance sheet and CF dynamics. P/E relates P/L and market price. P/B relates balance sheet and market price. FCF/P ... you get it. But each metric only tells you a part of the whole story. You want to understand the full story; understand the dynamics.

P/E 25 = 4% yield, P/E 17 = 6%, P/E 6.6 = 15%

(I hope I do not mess up stuff here. Correct me if I am wrong.)

Buffett uses a risk free rate of at least 2%. I use 15% as discount rate always, just to eliminate distortions based on suppressed discount rate at the moment. My 15% is wrong because it does not adjust for different risk levels across companies, whereas the market discount rate likely understates the actual risk because central banks set risk free rate at 0% and below and flood the market with printed money. Choose your poison."

If the management wants to issue new shares (beyond the limit of authorized shares, for instance to finance an acquisition), they'll need the approval of the board of directors (who represents shareholders... at least in theory !)

Yes, you can cancel shares (which is immediately relutive to the existing shareholders) or decide to hold them in treasury. Typical of mature businesses (see GAP recently).

However the shiller P/E of the company is at 25. Historically this industry has a shiller P/E of 17. How would you maintain a margin of safety considering that the even though the ROIC and growth, which are uncertain predictions of the future, look promising the stock is priced outside of the historical mean.

2016-05-28 09:11:46,I don't trust guys in suits. Especially ones selling derivatives.
2016-05-28 08:56:54,puh... quite a long answer!
2016-05-28 08:56:33,"Really good questions! In short, I do not compare multiples for *valuation* proposes. For valuation I use absolute Dollars. 

The goal is to know the following: $1 invested in stocks of the company results in $0.63 equity ownership and generates $0.13 Owner Earnings of which $0.03 is used in for debt service, $0.01 for dividends and $0.09 for growth investments at 15% ROIC. Next year, your equity ownership is $0.72 (= $0.63 + $0.09) and generates $0.1435 (= $0.13 + $0.09 * 15%) Owner Earnings which $0.03 for debt service (interest and repay remained constant the next year), $0.01 for dividends (remained constant too) and left $0.1035 for growth investments at 15% ROIC rate. IF the customer market saturates and cannot deploy more capital, the ROIC decreases eventually.

How to get there? My key metric is return on invested capital (ROIC). I use an approximation for ROIC while screening. For valuation I calculate the real ROIC manually by correcting for of accounting charges and making assumptions. If a company has an ROIC &gt;= 15% its likely a good company. The next question I try to answer is ""is the high ROIC long term sustainable and why?"". Based on the ROIC, balance and market price I can calculate what is a $1 investment worth in this compnay in 1..5..10 year (this is rather difficult; lots of assumptions have to be made; just stay conservative). What is reinvested in the business and thus compounded by ROIC? what is paid out? When is the market saturated? What happens to the cash flow when crisis hit? Debt has to be paid, but liquidity might be short. What does the management do when it cannot deploy any more capital?

I do compare competitor multiples during valuation (not screening), just to see if some competitor is better than ""my"" company and therefore a better investment. Also interesting is walking up (suppliers) and down (customers) the supply chain."
2016-05-28 08:52:37,"(1) Enterprise value = all the capital injected (equity) and lended by the various stakeholders, or what it would (in theory) cost to duplicate the business (how much capital you would have to line up).

Liabilities inherited from the Macondo incident shouldn't be included in your calculcation. It's a debt indeed, but it isn't capital invested in order to generate a return. 

(2) Common shares authorized = the maximum amount of shares a company can sell. Par value can be any price.

Treasury stock = shares bought back by the company, and thus removed from the equity (= capital injected by shareholders in the business). 

If they're in treasury, it means they haven't been cancelled. It's your job to figure out why (can be to pay management, which isn""t nice to shareholders, or to be used as a currency for future acquisitions)."

I can only speak to the fact that in general, top tier PE/HFs are very competitive. The most common track of getting in is undergrad at a ""target"" school --&gt; IBD --&gt; PE or HF --&gt; stay and continue in PE/HF or get an MBA --&gt; then get back into PE/HF. Given the number of PE/HF spots there are versus the number of target school students with finance experience, (there are plenty of the latter), it is difficult to get in without that. I've unfortunately seen a decent amount of delusional people who hope for the best by getting into an MBA and trying to break into PE/HF after, yet possess little intellectual skill or humility, and fall flat on their faces.  It is very off-putting to meet these people who are simply obsessed with making a ton of money. No. People need a passion for the work and preferably, a ton of discipline/self-control.

That being said, diversity often improves decision making, so a smart PE/HF place is hopefully aware enough to appreciate unusual, useful skillsets to add to their teams. You need to have superior social, communication, and analytical skills to stand out enough. "

2016-09-02 08:02:39,"Very interesting, thanks for the post. Reminds me of this excerpt from Seth Klarman's Margin of Safety, which I think may apply to today's markets:

&gt; 	Some investors, fixated on current return, reach for yield not with a new Wall Street product, but a very old one: common stocks. Finding bond yields unacceptably low, they pour money into stocks at the worst imaginable times. These investors fail to consider that bond market yields are public information, well known to stock investors who incorporate the current level of interest rates into share prices. When bond yields are low, share prices are likely to be high. **Yield-seeking investors who rush into stocks when yields are low not only fail to achieve a free lunch, they also tend to buy in at or near a market top.**

2016-09-01 11:52:29,"I will definitely plan to let you know what I think of what you said. This is a ton of information, however, so it's going to take me some time to digest it so I can respond thoughtfully. :)"
2016-09-01 11:37:11,"likewise, i just pieced all these things together myself, I have no formal training in economics nor do I want any, most of what's taught in universities these days is theory developed in the past 30 years, theories assuming the monetary system we have now is the system we'll have forever, when a simple study of history proves that that has *never* been the case. money-at-interest is an untenable practice in the long run, basically central banks just want to create wealth from nothing; the economy is a self-regulating system, central bank interference juices it and does produce some kind of stimulus, but it's the same thing as steroids, eventually the system just can't sustain the forced input and has to correct to a real concensus of value. Look at a 30 year chart of the SP500 to see it in effect.

I agree with just about everything you said, and you're spot on about cash being a better wealth hedge than bitcoin/gold but be careful; it is possible to go from deflation to inflation very quickly. Right now we're in mild deflation (would be severe deflation without QE and other money-printing practices), and we'll continue to be in deflation until central banks make a drastic change in their policies (ultimately resulting in directly financing the debt). There are just too many debts to repay and not enough growth/income to repay it, people are saving money to pay down debts and aren't investing/spending it. This is problematic because it's like a negative feedback loop: more uncertainty in future growth -&gt; more cash hoarding -&gt; deflation -&gt; more uncertainty about future growth, etc. The theory here is that central banks can slash interest rates, make money cheaper/easier to borrow, people spend it on stuff and things get moving again. This is a fundamental core of modern economic theory, and I think the past 8 years of zero-bound rates kind of disproves its validity.

We need yield because money has an interest rate attached to it, if money is lent into the economy at %0.5 and there's only %0.2 of yield, that's an unsustainable system bound to collapse. So... to get a bit conspiratorial I think this system was ultimately designed to fail. It's made a lot of its directors rich, at the expense of the public. It's also helped strongarm countries into joining a globalist system/taking loans from the IMF in order to stay alive in what is an inherently caustic, debt-mandatory financial system. But I digress.

Money shouldn't have a yield, it simply needs to maintain a supply equal to the demand for it, thus you have price stability. In a debtless monetary system deflation is no worse than inflation; however in a debt-based monetary system inflation is necessary, since debts are nominal and inflation destroys the real value of currency, making debts easier to repay (although the creditors still would be losing purchasing power, granted the main creditor are central banks who made this money from nothing so it's usually contained), whereas deflation ruins ability to repay debts and is a Sword of Damocles for governments.

It's all very confusing, and purposefully so, to keep people from wising up to the real objective of central banks; to unify the world under a global financial system they control (embodied by the IMF and their Special Drawing Rights) by holding nation's economies hostage via loaning their currencies to them, at interest. Take that into perspective and a lot of what seems to be bullshit, becomes undoubtedly bullshit. But even if you're totally unbiased in contemplation of this system, you'll still reach the conclusion that it is plainly untenable, so to call it 'conspiracy theory' is rather short-sighted. Economics is %95 common sense.

Anyway, if you want a more alternative (and i'd argue real) view of the economy this guy makes lots of sense. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xDSgOMifo8

By 2011, a former Amazon executive says, the company realized it would soon overwhelm FedEx and UPS during the holidays: &amp;quot;We were just going to blow them out of the water.&amp;quot; So, he says, Amazon decided to create an alternative.

2016-09-01 10:27:23,"I don't think it's about whether people use physical cash and whether more or less physical cash as a % of money supply affects interest rates. 

I THINK the author is making a case for removing it as an alternative, so that people would be FORCED to only keep their savings within electronic accounts or assets. In an electronic cash account, you don't have much of a say over how the value of that cash changes. It has historically gone up due to positive interest rates (e.g. your bank lends it to the US government at like 2% and gives you like 1% of it). People generally and vaguely understand that we have to put some into assets such as stocks to earn a return above inflation (because even with the interest that's earned on cash in a savings account, it's losing value over time due to inflation). 

If interest rates were to go negative, some people would consider changing their cash into physical cash because physical cash can't legally be taken away, so it'll be worth more than the cash that's left in negatively yielding accounts. This is even better than switching over the gold/bitcoin because the value of physical cash wouldn't fluctuate due to the market trends.

I think?? Is this right? My brain is getting blown out by trying to understand this stuff. Also I don't even think a ""free market"" has anything to do with this. Cash's value has been getting manipulated due to central bank activity; allowing for this to happen would strengthen the tools for manipulation. Right?

To your other points, why exactly do we need growth or yield? I think fears about deflationary spirals are overblown and not enough attention is being paid to how structurally inefficient our economy has become due to poorly written government regulations and systems rife with loopholes. Helicopter money has not really worked in other countries. I have a theory that inflation/growth has been so tepid because the structure of the economy discourages productivity. The central bank activities have been making it worse because it's making already wealthy people even richer; though I understand the need to stabilize the stock market so that employers don't mass fire people and stuff like that.

I can detail this more if you're interested, but my understanding is definitely not perfect, so please don't hold me to unreasonably high standards."

given how we've had pathetic growth w/ 8 years of the lowest interest rates set ever, yeah, hard assets like Bitcoin and gold are very attractive places to shelter wealth. we NEED growth/yeild of some kind else all your retirees end up homeless and you get serious social instability. central banks will have to unleash zero-coupon, helicopter money and directly monetize the debt, which will be highly inflationary and will juice the economy back into activity. my guess is they'll unleash it if/when the spx tanks to 1500 or so.

2016-08-31 10:58:55,"I am former lawyer turned investor and money manager, so I can say that the transition is possible. As I talk to other investors, I have been surprised to meet a number of others that have law degrees.  And, as others have noted, Charlie Munger started as a lawyer.  That said, it is a challenging transition in the best of circumstances.

One thing to think about is how prepared you are to make the transition.  For me, I had a undergrad finance / economics degree, and my legal career was big law, m&amp;a, and securities work, and then I spent several years as a senior exec at a public company.  So, before thinking about making the career change, I already had extensive experience in financial analysis and in understanding financial statements.  If you understand some of the basics of finance / accounting, that is one thing.  If you are really starting from scratch, your learnings curve will be much steeper and longer.

The second thing to consider is whether you have the passion to be a value investor.  When I describe my day, mainly reading 10-Ks and thinking about business models, most think it is mind-numbingly boring.  But I love it.  And, prior to making the transition, I spent several years managing my own money as a hobby, and both really enjoyed the process and had good success.

2016-08-30 22:26:09,":) Nope, but I regularly mentor students from my undergraduate (went to a ""target"" school) and love to help out when possible. 

Absolutely, they are very aggressive.

But I see them as having the HF version of IBD training. Brutal, aggressive, but gives you a foundation for life. I was one of those types that went into IBD knowing I would likely to try to jump out as soon as possible. IBD crazed kids always talk about ""exit"" opportunities and it was very true for me. I even secured a completely unrelated internship (a startup) in my senior year because I had a contract with my IBD job post college. 

If you leave, you'll have to unlearn some of their work style, yes, because brutal honesty doesn't fly with everyone, but they'll likely force you to be top notch in your researching and debate skills. 

They'll also give you insight into the total universe of possible assets to manage. If I were a student wanting to do hedge funds, I'd be less interested in public US equities (so many do this, what's really the edge anymore) and much more in select emerging market or frontier market assets. Our economy is much more likely to continue globalizing; so being able to observe from a Bridgewater place will likely give you great insight in seeing where pockets of big opportunities could be. That's what I'd do if I were a student in college studying finance or economics today; try to find some amazing HF job that had me traveling the world.

The only places that I think offer more ""exit opportunities"" or ""prestige"" or ""great training"" are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. But we're in the SecurityAnalysis sub, so I doubt that's relevant to you or anyone else here."

I've actually had dinner with an analyst from Bridgewater before and have spoken to several others who work there. On one hand I see the appeal of the sort of transparency they go for there, but at the same time it seems a little too aggressive for me.  I also don't like the fact that I wouldn't be working on independent company analysis. From what I've gathered, the investment associate role at Bridgewater is more of a research support role that doesn't really see the effect of the work on the portfolio/have any say on the investment decision/how the work is used. 

I could be mistaken though. Big brand name thats for sure. "

They're also one of the few places that really don't mind taking people right after college (versus many HFs often cherry pick from IBD, etc.)."

2013-10-15 15:16:39,"I'm not using CAPM to value the asset. I'm using CAPM to determine what the market implied expectations are for company financial metrics.

"
2013-10-15 05:50:56,"I'm not sure where the 8% is from, probably a small premium over what is the historical norm for lower rated debt.

I think Greenwald says that VC investors require 15%, so that's his upper bound.

But the point is, you're never going to guess at cost of equity to compute intrinsic value for a franchise company.  There you're going to use r = E/P + g to see what return you think you'll get at today's price (think IRR instead of NPV)

The only time you'd compute intrinsic value is for a non-franchise company, where (according to Greenwald) growth is worth nothing.  So intrinsic value reduces to just P = E / r.  Here if your estimate of r turns out to be a little off, it doesn't cause the valuation to swing as wildly.

And Greenwald would add that to check whether you did it right, you'd also compute an asset replacement value (ARV).  Those two valuations: the earnings power value (EPV) from the income statement, and the ARV primarily from the balance sheet, allow you to triangulate on the true value.

If they're significantly different, double-check your math and assumptions.  If they're STILL significantly different, you've either found a franchise (EPV&gt;ARV) or a case where value can be unlocked if poor mgmt is removed or a bad business segment is shut down (EPV&lt;ARV).


"
2013-10-15 05:16:19,"and it gets worse.  you also have the problem of what to use for the market risk premium.  if you're familiar with the literature (which I'm not, very) the estimate of what it is evidently ranges from 4%-10%. 

so if Rf=0%, maybe COE = 1.5 x 10% = 15%
or maybe COE = 0.5 x 4% = 2%  !

if you want to use CAPM though, there is a way to reduce your confidence interval on what beta is, and that is to use the beta for the industry instead. the averaging over multiple companies reduces the standard error.  damodaran suggests doing this and has a page where he maintains the industry betas.  note that you have to take this unlevered average and adjust for the leverage of the individual company.

2013-10-15 02:07:03,"I know everyone is going to poke fun at Fama and the EMH, but it's sad that Hansen's contributions are largely being ignored because they're difficult for a layperson to understand.

Even if we ignore all of his other work, Hansen's 1982 (Hansen, Singleton 1982) statistical model, GMoM, is actually a very, very useful tool for investors. If anything, it's one of the best statistical tools for quantitative financial analysis because it uses as few 'silly' assumptions as possible while still being consistent and unbiased. Furthermore, GMoM can have as many equations in the system as needed, and it can even be used on non-linear systems. Most (if not all), types of regression analysis can actually be defined as special cases of GMoM."
2013-10-15 01:19:51,"While I get why you would want to use what the market uses to value an asset, what guarantees do you have that your beta value is a fair approximation to the market's? As sencha71 pointed out, the beta's standard error is typically unacceptably high. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think just a tiny change in the beta might cause the overall valuation to swing wildly in one direction or the other."
2013-10-15 01:07:37,"See this is exactly where my gripes lie with calculating the RR; it is FAR TOO subjective. Every other variable can be logically estimated by drawing on historical data and making small subjective adjustments. But with the RR the only objective point one can start from would be the YTM x debt% (or just plain YTM since cost of equity definitely has to be larger) as you just mentioned and the rest of it is simply a judgement call. It seems far too arbitrary for my liking tbh... Where does 8-15% come from? 

The only thing I can say with certainty is that the RR should be higher than YTM, which is a real pity because the Gordon growth model is pretty neat, provided the inputs are sound. If i plug in some arbitrary coc, which may very well be rubbish, I get a rubbish valuation."

2013-10-14 23:20:55,"sencha71 hit in on the head as far as what Greenwald does.

I primarily use DCFs to understand price implied expectations. I want to use what the market uses for DCF in my process, thus I'm using CAPM to get to my cost of capital estimates.

As I move pretty much exclusively to special situations investing, most of my valuations use public comps. In this case, it's a judgement call anchored off of similar companies for what the appropriate multiple would be.

2013-10-14 14:56:27,"it's a form of the dividend discount model or gordon growth model.  but greenwald is saying rather than using:

P = E / (r - g)

or 

P/E = 1 / (r - g)

with some algebra you can re-arrange this to:

r = E/P + g

the dividend plus buyback ""cash yield"" is the first part of the equation.  you can still guess at g if you like, but you don't end up with the phenomenon of the correct P (intrinsic value) jumping all over the place with slight changes in your guesses at r and g, if you use that bottom equation to compute your expected return instead."
2013-10-14 14:53:17,[deleted]
2013-10-14 14:42:08,"i think greenwald usually says the following:

(1) cost of debt is often obvious, just look at the YTM on their bonds.  that also gives you a lower bound for the cost of equity.

(2) forget using beta to estimate cost of equity. the standard error on the regression is usually so large as to make the estimate unusable (e.g. beta=1.0 plus or minus 0.5).  but their cost of equity is going to be somewhere between 8-15%.  for a large, low-risk firm 8-9%.  for a small, high-risk firm 14-15%.  you really have to familiarize yourself with the company and - gasp - use your judgement. 

and of course cost of capital is the weighted average of the two."
2013-10-14 13:46:00,"Presented with such cases, one would typically take a two step approach for calculating PV of inflows: the first half being for the periods where growth outpaces coc and the second half for the periods in which growth peters off to a normalised rate, allowing the series to converge into a finite point (g under coc). Sum total of both stages would then be finite.

Such is the flaw of DCMs and the subjectivity in deriving cocs and projected values.   Speaking of which, how do you guys in this sub arrive at your coc rates? Looking for some healthy discussion as I'm thoroughly dissatisfied with all methods I've seen thus far.

Eliminating the need to pay rent yourself or generating income by renting out real estate can should drastically alter its ""real return"".

2013-10-06 02:27:16,"Imo, one of the more discernible changes we're seeing from ACA is the shift from a supply model that is vendor/rep focused to one that is direct and nationalized. The days are dwindling for a model where a doc buys $1000 orthopedic screws from a hot little sales rep who takes him out to steak dinner. It's crazy that a sales rep makes more for watching a surgery than the MD actually doing it, and MD's are catching onto this. Hospitals are making spending transparent on a physician level, a la peer pressure. Used to be that a doc gets paid for every little thing he does; now he'll (ideally) be getting paid for every little thing he can avoid needing to order. For the first time in HC, physicians are incentivized to be cost cutters.

Hospitals are looking at where the $'s are funneling, and starting with the big spenders. Radiology and medical devices are definitely on the radar.  Wright Direct is something to watch unfold.  Diagnostic labs: will hospitals outreach for more in-house and catch more reimbursement arb?

I've been following ALOG, which does ultrasound, sells to MRI/CT OEMs, and sells to CT airport baggage checks.  They're interesting because they've been toying with the idea of going direct with MRI/CT and competing with the GE's of the world; this is not the right time to do this. I'm wondering if they're being forced to do this due to a push out from the OEMs.  They also sell ultrasound direct (including a recent acquisition). These guys are small and they're not going to be able to scale to Siemen-level margins when sales start to get pressured.  These machines are expensive, and hospitals want to cut costs here. Note that it is hard to measure the upside risk from their airport baggage CT scanners, which they claim is a near-term grower."

Why would anyone want to pay you for your 3% when they can go into the market and get 5%? As a result the person selling the 3% has to drop their price.   "

2013-10-04 15:46:56,"&gt;""What makes the current episode so difficult to understand for most investors is the atypical nature of
the processes employed to remediate a once-in-a-lifetime balance sheet recession. Prices are not being driven
upward by a highly visible speculative frenzy triggered by remarkable technological innovation, but by concerned investors desperate for any return on their money. Mainstream economists, who focus on the nation’s income statement, are hard-pressed to opine intelligently on what is a balance sheet phenomen on. Analogous to trying to quench an oil fire with water, central bankers around the world are fighting a solvency crisis with liquidity...

&gt; ...The “imperious immediacy of interest,” the intense desire for the intended consequences of one’s actions, tends to blind the policymaker to the unintended consequences of those same actions. The experiment of driving the cost of money to zero has caused huge price distortions and led to massive malinvestment, to which most investors appear oblivious

To which:

&gt; Envision cash as an option that can be valued. Think of it as a call option on any asset, with no expiration date, and with no strike price. As long as you’re holding cash – liquidity – the world of future investment opportunities, wherever and whenever they might appear, is your oyster.

As a new student of investing and markets, this is fascinating stuff to me. I have not been able to make any sense of things lately. Theories akin to this seem to explain what is happening right now so beautifully.

The question is, where do I go from here? Although ""conventional"" wisdom seems to be screaming to buy buy buy securities (""stay in the market because you don't want to miss out on any gain!!!!!!""), I have realized quite a lot of gains since 2007-ish. If stocks are fundamentally over-valued and over-hyped right now, interest rates are close to zero, and gold is... well I have no clue about gold, then doesn't it seem prudent to sell securities and realize some gains from the past 5-6 year run? A pool of cash right now while values are high seems like a value-minded course of action.

Notice I haven't mentioned a coming crash or a downturn or any of that. Just simply that stocks are over valued presently which makes them an insecure investment from a value standpoint.

He also bought Burlington Northern outright (&gt;24B cash, plus equity) [this will also be a killer investment], he invested in IBM near the end of the recession (late 2010 I think he started).

I feel its related to the Book Antifragile (by N. Taleb)? He proposes heuristics to handle disequilibrium / complex systems like economies. Where as the articles propose (physic-related) economic models to derive policies for economies (even if model assumptios are false).

I have written a software for computational fluid dynamics (is related to plasma fluid simulations; I had heavy support from Phds). One thing I got from this nerd stuff is, that if model parameter are not fine tuned, the simulations explode (very narrow parameter ranges) and if the model geometry changes minimally, the simulation result could differ extremly from the previous simulations (butterfly effect). 
I concluded, that it is awesome for machinaries optimization, but too instable for economic models (because the model and its parameter are to volatile and therefore the model can justify every economic policy)."

If investing all your money into profitable businesses is clearly more desirable than investing all your money into gold, then clearly investing into business is more desirable than investing in gold, and therefore you shouldn't invest any of your money into something demonstrably less desirable.

67% is retail notes secured by equipment, as you describe (90% of which is Ag &amp; Turf), and 6% is financing retail leases. A further 18% is wholesale notes to dealers, which is very short term. Apparently they do revolving charge accounts as well, to the tune of $2.6B (10% of all receivables) ... I guess that's just normal credit cards? And that's pretty much all of it.

It's not clear to me whether the parent company is fully or partially protected from disasters at the Capital Corp subsidiary. The relevant section of the 10-K is as follows:

&gt;The Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. For 2013 and 2012, Capital Corporation’s ratios were 3.04 to 1 and 2.30 to 1, respectively, and never less than 2.75 to 1 and 2.02 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company has also committed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, the Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement in 2013 or 2012.

I'm coming to think the financial services shouldn't be a reason to avoid Deere - and that a Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation should really turn on the prospects and finances of the equipment operations.

2014-01-08 15:12:08,Agree: Corn is especially susceptible. I wonder what the crop distribution is for Deere though: how much of Deere's revenue/profit comes from Corn farmers as opposed to crops that are less likely to fall in price in the coming years...I'll try to see if there is data on this.
2014-01-08 14:00:33,"Helpful to have a sense of size of the various units. Based on 2013 Operating Profit, the business is 85% Equipment Ops, and 15% Financial Services. They sometimes break out Equipment Ops into Agriculture/Turf and Construction/Forestry, so:

Ag &amp; Turf: 79%  
Construction &amp; Forestry: 6%  
Financial Services: 15%  

Though of course the balance sheet for Financial Services is significantly larger.

Also geographically, helpful to keep in mind that equipment sales are 80% US/Canada, and 20% rest of world. So despite their many tentacles, Deere's results are still driven by sales to the American farmer."

2014-01-07 14:09:10,"Yes and Buffett doesn't have $7 trillion to spend either!

I think what Buffett did with that example was show us that if investing in productive assets makes much more sense than investing in gold at one level (the level being purchasing either all the gold in the world or farmland/businesses), then that ought to be the case at every other level as well.

If you had $7 trillion to invest and you had to pick gold or productive assets, why would that change if suddenly we're talking about $7000? Would you rather have $7000 worth of productive farmland and American enterprise, or some gold to stare at?

Buffett is showing that the opportunity cost of investing in gold (forgoing the opportunity to invest in productive businesses) is simply not worth it.

That's just my interpretation though! I've had to watch that same video dozens of times for it to really sink into my thick head hah!"
2014-01-07 14:05:25,"Exactly what I thought of when I listened to this. In the United States you don't think of inflation as being really all that significant. You expect what is in your bank account today will be the same amount in one year if nothing is added or taken away. However, in other countries, [Argentina] for example, simply by holding gold and hoping no price decay, you may have a 25% return because of inflation. If I was worried that my net worth could drop by 25% just by staying in cash, I would absolutely consider gold as an investment that could easily be turned into cash as needed.

We applied the discounted cash flow and discounted earnings to the top ranked predictable companies, and calculated the intrinsic values of the these companies. These are the companies that appeared to be undervalued as measured by discounted cash flow model or discounted earning model. The formula and methodology are described in What worked in the market from 1998-2008? Intrinsic Value, Discounted Cash Flow and Margin of Safety. The assumptions for the calculations are:

We assumed a discount rate of 12%.
The tangible book values of the business is used as the current book value.

The growth rate for the next 10 years are assumed to be the same as the average growth rate of the past 10 years. If the growth rate is higher than 15%, we will use 15%.
and for the terminal values, we use 4% growth rate.
Compared with the DCF Calculator, in this page we use the EPS of the last fiscal year as default earnings, and the average of the first 5-year period and the second 5-year period as the default growth. While in the DCF calculator we use TTM EPS and 10-year compound growth rate as default.
The intrinsic value of the companies are calculated with:

Intrinsic Value = Book Value + Future Earnings at Growth Stage + Terminal Value"

For example, I probably wouldn't have gone out of my way to learn pension accounting on my own without studying it for the Level II exam.  And I do believe you need to understand pension accounting to understand how the income statement can be manipulated by pension assumptions and whether a pension fund is underfunded and a large liability to a company (by *your* analysis.  Not what the company tells you.)

If you can learn this on your own, major props.  I just kind of figured if you have to learn it, you might as well take the CFA Level I and Level II exams.  Plus passing the exams helps if you're trying to get a job in the industry.

2014-01-05 12:36:18,"Hello Achillies Value, 
this is amazing information and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much for your answer. I also tend to sit in the absolute value camp, and like DCF's, but in this particular company's case they have just turned Adj. EBITDA profitable 2 years ago and are a small player that is likely to be bought out by a larger one soon (or expand rapidly through buying out other small players) so the value is mainly derived through its special situation status.

I'll try out some of your suggestions. Thank you again!"
2014-01-05 09:11:45,"This gets into the debate of relative vs absolute investing. Einhorn says in his book he is absolute return investor. I dont manage money for others so I obviously never want to lose money but care much more about long term returns not absolute. However, back to main point for absolute return investor 20% not bad and he outperformed vast majority of hedge funds (including long/short)"
2014-01-05 06:37:40,"A scam requires dishonesty, no? If retained assets can be reinvested at risk-adjusted rates competitive with the market, then it's just an economic decision to defer dividends. 

In any case, the blog writer is wrong to suggest that a dividend is superior to a buyback at overvalued levels. They are close to the same thing. To the extent that a buyback squanders value, the fault lies with the shareholder for effectively building a stake (holding on despite buybacks) despite over valuation.
"
2014-01-05 05:31:46,"I guess the best way to do it would be to extend the DCF out to the point when they become cash flow positive after the spike in capex drops out and make an assumption of normalised cash flow at that point. Of course this may be tricky but you will need to get an idea of what a business like that could reasonably be worth based on comparables and from modelling the operational drivers (i.e. subs growth, mkt share) that feed into the DCF.

Two publicly listed comps that might be worth a look are Iliad (ILD FP) and Jazztel (JAZ SM) which are both investing heavily in their networks and are not expected to produce positive cash flows until 2015 at the earliest. Maybe getting hold of any broker notes on these companies may help to give you an idea of how research analysts are valuing them."
2014-01-05 01:27:55,"Start with the base which should be liquidation value.  I don't have too much familiarity with EU telecom but in the US spectrum, towers, and other fixed assets have substantial value.  

Since FCF and EBITDA are irrelevant look at some industry specific valuation methodologies including EV / subscriber, revenue / subscriber, etc.  Some companies in telecom would never make money as an independent company but their network would be worth a lot to a strategic buyer.  I would also recommend looking at EV / Revenue and EV / Gross Profit vs peers.  The gross profit ratio gets rid of accounting gunk and the revenue ratio is the ""activist ratio"" showing how efficient the company is being run per $ of revenue.  Two things to keep in mind though make sure your comparing apples to apples, as you mentioned the internet connectivity which might make your company different than a normal telecom company.  Also remember the methods I suggested are relative value methodologies vs absolute value.  There are many successful relative value portfolio managers and to each their own but I firmly sit in the absolute value camp."

New Residential got hit very hard by the REIT sell-off, falling from a high of above $7 to just a few cents over $6. Unfortunately this was a situation where $6.75 looked good to me, $6.50 looked better and $6.25 even better, so I was buying all the way down and, rather than catching the bottom, I caught a falling knife, and ended up with an average a cost of around $6.55."

2013-06-25 21:52:29,"No doubt his semi-active involvement did boost the company's financial performance. However you have to assume that it would have been a good deal even had its existing performance continued. Otherwise he would not have had the margin of safety. 

Another famous Buffett quote (which I think comes from the discussion of ABC/Capital Cities in one of his letters) is along the lines that a really good franchise will still have enviable performance even if it is run by the owner's shiftless and backward nephew. Of course the performance will be better with excellent management. 

Probably Buffett was employing this same type of thinking for the Washington Post Company.

2013-06-25 18:09:03,"No problem.  These are filed publicly alongside other company filings.  

I invest in post-insolvency companies (global, absolute return mandate) for a living, so am happy to attempt to answer any other questions you may have.  I'm discovering that it's a rare skillset!  I used to work in a bank restructuring department, which is how I cut my teeth; helping to actually restructure failing/recovering companies.

Edit: the docs you originally requested are all for understanding the company during the restructuring - particularly useful if you want to invest in the debt or equity as a 'vulture' and aim to get either repaid during the process, or receive securities issued and distributed to pre-restructuring securityholders.  However, legal expertise is just as, if not more, important than investing expertise during this process.  You can ride on the coat-tails of hedge funds, but they get it wrong sometimes too."

2013-06-25 18:00:08,"Investing in re-organised companies doesn't require access to the proceedings.  You can look at the chapter 11 re-emergence filings, which are usually fantastically detailed, and mostly conservative because management can't afford to miss targets at that stage."
2013-06-25 17:04:28,"From the article:  *""I thought there was a good chance margins would improve (at that time Katherine Graham began to focus her attention on improving operations)""*

I bet the only reason margins improved was that Buffett got on the board and tactfully taught Kay Graham how to run the business.  I bet the reason this bargain existed was because the market was assuming that the controlling shareholders were more focused on journalism that profits.  Since Graham held special voting shares and couldn't be removed from her management position by a regular shareholder vote, the market assumed that this dire situation would continue indefinitely.  It took a special person like Buffett to change that situation, so to suggest that a regular shareholder could have earned those returns without someone like Buffett getting involved is inaccurate in my opinion.  I think his Coke investment was similar - he bought a bunch of stock, used his powers of persuasion to get on the board and convinced them to stop the dumb price war they were having with Pepsi.  "

2013-06-25 13:13:11,"Thanks, and yes I was also thinking of the future rate implications or previously low finances, I am using WACC for a discount rate to value future cash flows &amp; economic profit calculation. It may also be useful in assessing financial leverage, although I have no model for it currently. Do use the W/A rate for the cost of debt from the 10K footnote as the cost of debt?

Cheers and thanks for the help. "
2013-06-25 12:15:17,"Here's a very simple example of what I do to calculate the cost of debt:  [link to pic](http://i.imgur.com/4wAEHeJ.png)

Just go to the company's debt footnote and they should at least have the individual debt issues broken down into date of maturity, amount raised, and the rate.  Take a weighted average of those to get the company's overall cost of debt.  I use this to forecast out changes in the company's overall debt from year to year, not to calculate WACC because I usually only use cost of equity in my valuations.  If you're going for an accurate WACC you will probably want to understand at what rate the company can borrow in a ""normal"" interest rate environment; you don't want to artificially deflate the WACC because the company happened to have just had a big issuance at a historically low interest rate.

BTW, what are you using WACC for?"
2013-06-25 11:43:20,"Sure,  for example valuation techniques.  When I first started learning about investing most books talked about how you needed to value the company before you bought it but they generally didn't show you how to do the valuations.  The only valuation that I found easily was the asset reproduction valuation.  It took me years to find some of the valuations I use now.

I will talk about many valuation techniques in the book, show everyone how to do them, what the terms in the valuations mean, and how to adjust the numbers for yourself.

The book is aimed at beginning to intermediate level value investors."
2013-06-25 11:28:49,"thank you 5-year beta may seem most appropriate. So you use the YTM on the most recent debt as an assumption for the entire debt pile? I understand 10% WACC is a great starting point and average but through my calculations I have found companies ranging from 8-15% and can alter the future cash flows (especially terminal) with a large variance. 

The sensitivity table is a great idea, thanks! "

2013-06-25 00:43:38,"If you have a long time horizon, there's really nothing that will give you a forward view of a stock's volitility.  I'd just use the 60 month beta and take that as a starting point - value your cashflows using a sensitivity table as opposed to finding ""the one"" cost of equity figure.

For cost of debt I try to keep it simple and just calculate the debt outstanding and applicable rates from the debt footnote in the most recent 10K/Q."
2013-06-24 22:34:52,"The weighted average cost of capital is suppose to represent the required rate of return for an investor.  You don't have to value the entire firm. You can always calculate free cash flow to the equity holders and discount it by your required rate of return.

Warren Buffet always said to just use 10% - which simply meant he wanted at least a 10% return on his capital before making an investment.

Anyway, to directly answer your question you should look at beta forecasting which is done by Barra through a method of correlation forecasts. "

Yeah MBOE is a horribly flawed metric as of now but still useful.

Production, production growth, EBITDA margins at certain commodity price levels, reserves, and management are the bread and butter.

That is partially the reason. The other is the choice investors have between bond yields and stock yields. As the risk/return tradeoff improves for bonds, stocks lose some appeal.

"
2013-06-23 21:47:04,"The Fed buying bonds injects capital into the financial system via banks and keeps rates low to encourage risk capital to be used for business ventures (to create jobs, stimulate the economy, etc.).  Slowing the ""gas pedal"" or stopping this program will 

* increase interest rates
* increase bond yields (because bond yields are dictated from a combination of the yield on treasuries (which is dictated from the Fed Funds Rate, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve, and a risk level associated with the bonds -- assumed to be unchanging)
* stocks will, more than likely, be hurt because there is a fear that the injection of capital into the economy is the only reason the economy has been doing well, and that by changing this, the economy isn't strong enough to support current valuations
* housing prices will be probably be hurt by the increase in interest rates, for the same reason that bonds will (as home mortgages are fundamentally similar to bonds)
* Commodity prices will likely be affected relative to the ""cost of carry"" of the specific commodity.  The reasoning behind this is that an investor has to pay interest on holding the commodity being traded (i.e. oil is very expensive in this regard), and will be hurt that way.  The actual value of commodities will likely be unchanged.

Hope that helps! "

I understood it intuitively, by looking at capex and free cash flow, but if you had asked me why a $1 of free cash flow from Ford is worth less than the equivalent from Colgate, I wouldn't have had a good reason. Relatedly, I had no understanding of the importance of working capital, and how large working capital needs can destroy a good business, and how that affects valuation. That may be due to my own lack of formal business education, but it took me a long time, and reading many investing books, to figure that out.

2013-06-20 20:40:58,"I have thought about writing a book titled ""How to Analyze 10K's: Value Investing in the Real World"". 

But then I realized there were some problems.

* I have to compare 3-5+ years worth of 10K's for each company.
* Explain how the company evolved over that time, usually coming up with a story.
* Explain why the company had intrinsic value that was durable over time.
* Explain why the stock was cheap **at the time**.

Now this last one is tricky, because most stocks **look** fairly valued, unless it's a microcap net-net or something like that. Only in hindsight (or with a good foresight) does stocks look cheap. For example, was AIG at $40 cheap in early 2011? How about at $25 in late 2011? How about now?

So after all that work, I still wanted to say something like ""This will work only 40% of the time. You just have to take my word that 400 batting average is really awesome"".

And then I ask myself
* I'm not doing anything that every other value investor is doing.
* I'd rather be reading 10K's, not writing books about them.

And then I realized Warren Buffett's favorite quote ""Buy great companies at a reasonable price"" summed up my entire hypothetical book.

2013-04-08 22:57:56,"Just skipped straight to chapter 8. Found the discussion on the difference between 'stock market valuation' and 'business valuation' (underlying asset) fascinating. 

The points about entering based on timing vs pricing are also interesting. Can you apply this to the mkt as a whole (Buffett mkt cap-to-GNP) and say the mkt is overvalued? And that fits within value investing theory?"
2013-04-08 22:41:55,"It is, in the end, all about conviction - perhaps the most human emotion there is. The issue here is *over*diversification, not diversification per se. "

2013-04-08 20:29:13,"The intelligent investor should be your foundation then if you are more serious about it go to security analysis. Keep in mind that these are some old old books and a lot has changed from back then, but the principles still hold true."

He mentions this in passing at the end but I think he glosses over the significance.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have a portfolio of 20-30 stocks and equal-weight them? If out of the tens of thousands of stocks out there I come up with 20 that I like, is it really wise to think that I can go one step further and rank order them?

2013-04-06 12:51:29,Great piece!
2013-04-06 11:27:43,"If your research is correct it seems like a compelling thesis. The risks of shorting are much more variable than those of buying however. Commonly the most important question with short pitches, after triple-checking research, is the time of realization. How long will it take for the market to reflect these unsustainable and crooked business practices in the share price? It seems like the market needs a catalyst to realize how poorly the company is run. What event could provide that? How much are you willing to pay to borrow the stock in the meantime (if you're shorting cash outright)? What's the likelihood of a price spike and getting a margin call (if you short outright)? Remember that there's an opportunity cost to the cash you put up as margin. How much are you willing to pay in theta (if you're shorting with puts)?"
2013-04-06 10:58:07,"The obsession with P/E in the modern era of ""value investing"" is absurd. It is incredibly easy to manipulate earnings, especially amongst financial companies (and financials comprise over 20% of the S&amp;P, by far the largest sector representation - highly relevant to this study). Investing in single names based on P/E is naive; market timing and forecasting an entire index based on P/E is equally silly.

Look to book value, fcf yield, ROIC&gt;WACC with appropriate capex. P/E is not a trusted or meaningful indicator to intelligent/conservative investors"
2013-04-06 00:16:52,"Yeah tough choice. Some of the people on this subreddit are real pro analysts, so they are use to a thinking pattern that to be honest is the correct way to analyze a complete company. A lot of the legendary investors have their own opinions of 100+ page reports as garbage and would prefer a simplistic report of investing which is what you are proclaiming, but all of them want a distinct reason for investment. It could be long and complex or short and concise. 20 pages is actually not that long. 

This is a value investing community and value investing is all about finding a reason for undervaluation and then a margin of safety from your valuation. If a company doesn't past your business valuation filter then you got to keep it in your pocket until it drops to the price you are willing to buy or sell at a hefty discount (your margin of safety 10, 20, 30, 40 , 50% etc). All companies are a buy/sell/hold at a given price. 

I'm not a ""pro"" because unfortunately I have other responsibilities that need to be taken care of first due to family obligations, but likewise I am a business owner with not a lot of time such as yourself (time wise at least). Thus, I have chosen to study first by reading prominent books and taking classes that fit my schedule (6-9pm) classes. Currently I'm taking financial statement analysis. I'm probably not going to be able to enter the investment field due to my age (26) and some disheartening truths such as ""networking"" to land a job in the field, but I want to educate myself on something I am passionate about and that passion is investing. I'm not ""wasting"" time when I don't find a company I want to invest into. I'm gaining experience and moreover the company has been analyzed and I have a buy/sell/hold number in my pocket from the analysis. You must have the heart to say ""no"" more than you say ""yes"" because not everything will be a screaming buy. This process is grueling, but its pretty cool when you come up with a number and then throw some money around or see if you were wrong or right on your analysis. I have been wrong and right haha, but in my defense the time when I was wrong it was complete BULLSHIT. Auditors lied.

The side bar has a book list that's really good. I would start with ""the intelligent investor"" by Graham. It will give you an idea of what is going on here - a nice stepping stone. "
2013-04-05 11:47:57,"&gt;The problem is, what if I spend 2 weeks on a company and it turns out it's not good?

Then you don't buy stock in that company.

&gt;And then I find another and spend additional 2 weeks, and that one isn't good either. What if I spend a whole year and don't find any good companies?

Then don't buy stock in those companies either.  As you develop your investment process, you should be able to filter out potential investments relatively quickly. You'll only dive deeper and deeper into a company if what you continue to see is compelling. This will cause you to miss opportunities, but there are no called strikes in the game of investing. The objective of investing is to not lose money, so you have to be very diligent in order to do so. It's easy to get average returns (index funds) and very difficult to get above average returns.

To give you an idea, I'm usually only able to come up with one good investment idea every quarter that is unique to me. I can usually source an additional good investment idea that I understand from investors' pitches and portfolios every quarter. 

That makes 8 ideas a year and that is plenty. Most of those ideas don't end up into my portfolio as my turnover is somewhere below 50%. The only reason I continue to do this is because it is fun for me and I want to see how much I can beat the index by over a 10 year period. If you don't enjoy the process and just want to make money you should index.

"
2013-04-05 03:33:00,"Right, so I've spent around 2 days on analyzing Lanxess, perhaps a bit more. I've also searched google for all kinds of news and opinions about the company, even in German.

The problem is, what if I spend 2 weeks on a company and it turns out it's not good? And then I find another and spend additional 2 weeks, and that one isn't good either. What if I spend a whole year and don't find any good companies? I can understand that investment companies with hundreds of analysts can afford to spend 2 weeks on analyzing a single paper, but surely individual investors can't work like that. Not to mention that I don't have 8h/day, only the weekends, to do this kind of analysis."
2013-04-05 02:46:28,"To give you an idea, I took a business valuation course to test what I have learned from Graham, Lynch, Fisher and Buffet. I randomly selected a  company and pooped out a 20 page report after 10 weeks of learning/studying. 

My professor was once the #1 ranked analyst in his industry of paper, but left due to moral duty and said the term paper I wrote was nearly perfect. All I had to do was move one paragraph in the introduction from the bottom to the top; this was more of a writing problem, but the analysis was dead on. It took me a 2 weeks to write it leisurely and would probably take 4-5 days of hard work 9-5ish style to produce that baby.

A lot of work goes into coming with an ultimate decision of buy sell or hold. 

Tips: quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, study: economics, accounting and finance. Great investor's books and you are already curious about the topic so this should be exciting for you. "
2013-04-05 02:29:36,"I think most simple predictive growth models tend to have a simple function of:

capital appreciation % + dividend return % +...X+...Z

of course they are using back history to come up with these numbers.

OP is using the shiller model with the formula of 6% for capital appreciation + shiller p/e + dividend yield + some weird math number that probably is valid.

I agree with you that the dividend yield should already be factored into the price similarly to the 6% back tested average historic growth because there should be some average dividend yield, but I think this model chooses to seperate the two components like most others allowing the user to have some choice into current yields. 

Greenbackd should have a much better idea about this. Also, you could be correct with a better model factoring in future dividend growth rates similar to capital appreciation growth rates. "
2013-04-04 23:02:18,"Known dividends should already be factored into the price, and unknown dividends are factored into the 3% growth + 3% inflation estimate."
2013-04-04 22:12:24,That would be part of the expected return.

2013-04-04 05:16:08,"Bayer is the type of company that would be hard to figure out with a value investor's conservative principles. The problem with Bayer ( I think its a pharm company) is that they have to do an ""s"" curve continuous growth since their patents on hit drugs will only last so many given years. 

most likely the stock went up due to expectations of a new drugs coming out of the pipeline, but yeah that's speculating. 

Personally, I have found that the market picks up undervaluations pretty quick on some of the stocks that would be ""popular"" choices in front of the masses. On some others that are ""dull"" businesses it might take a while. For example, Corning. Boring business. Undervalued. Going to take forever for the market to realize this, but yes it is undervalued using Graham's methods. 

Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, Graham are the key investor philosophys' that I follow. Take a look at their books when you have time since you can't take a financial accounting course or econ/business. (note Buffett has none, but he has many many videos and letters). In fact, although I think academics taught me a lot, books from my 4 core investors have really been the cherry on top. Shoot I read B Graham's accounting book haha just remembered that. That thing is only 100 pages and does a good job.

Best of luck!"

2013-04-03 20:17:23,"Currygoat's point is absolutely critical, and I am disappointed in our apparent acceptance of the EPS accretion ""holy grail"".

Berkshire's 2011 letter has a nice intro to the buyback decision process, starting on page 6: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2011ltr.pdf"
2013-04-03 19:54:27,"The purpose of those questions is to make sure you understand the business and you can make an intelligent decision on whether to buy or not buy Lanxess.

You will not be able to answer all of these questions, but these are the things you should be thinking about when you make investment decisions.  Fundamental analysis goes much further beyond ratios and figures a company's 3 main financial statements. You should understand how the industries in its segments operate and the major events that have happened over the past business cycle. You should definitely understand the how each of this company's segments make money and the competitive landscape in these segments. You should understand the strategy that management is pursuing and know whether they are good or bad at capital allocation.  

All these factors inform the assumptions you make when valuing a company. Using numbers or formulas alone without underlying basis to come to an estimate of intrinsic value is wrong.  If you're not able to do these things then you'll find it very hard to make buy/sell decisions.
"
2013-04-03 17:13:12,"&gt; I... why do I need to answer all those questions? 

Because if investing was easy we'd all be rich and laughing to the bank, you want good returns then be prepared to put in the work to achieve them. If you can't be bothered to figure out their cost structure in relation to close and similar competitors then why even bother looking at the company.

Edit: You have to remember that it's the underlying business you are paying for and that is why it's important to have answers to those questions."
2013-04-03 17:03:39,"I... why do I need to answer all those questions? I really appreciate your post and will try and answer all that during the weekend, but what is the purpose of all those questions? For example, what if I discover that Lanxess' cost structure is not as good as its competitors, should I not buy then? I don't think there are *any* companies out there that could answer positively to all those questions, this is why we have competition, cause one company is better in something than another, but not in everything.

&gt; Is the capital structure sustainable in the face of continued economic weakness in the EU?

It's been growing ever since the company was established, it had a positive year even in 2008 and had a steady growth ever since. Last year they were admitted into the DAX index. I think they're one of the few success stories of Europe."
2013-04-03 10:46:32,"You should look at share repurchases as capital allocation decisions like other outlays of cash. As such stock should only be repurchased when the company is undervalued.

Even though discussion revolved around this, looking at EPS accretion alone is a mistake when evaluating buybacks. An increase in EPS will only increase value if P/E multiples are constant or continuously increasing. We know that is not the case.

Most CEO's don't have the confidence to buyback shares when companies are clearly undervalued as the economy is usually in the shitter. We'll see in the long term how wise this transaction was."
2013-04-03 10:20:52,"I don't think you were going to get a response from people here either. I respond to posts like these from time to time as it looks like you are trying to learn. My response is long.

What you posted above does not examine the underlying business of Lanxess and does not pose a clear thesis to why this stock is undervalued.

I'm not sure you understand how many assumptions you're making in your statements above and how much key information about this company you've omitted. Additionally, many of the reasons you provide to prove this stock is cheap actually do the opposite. Let me go through some of your statements to show you what I mean:

&gt;Lanxess is a chemical company that produces all kinds of chemicals.

What type of chemicals does Lanxess produce? What feedstock do they use to produce these chemicals? What markets do they sell these chemicals into? What does the competitive landscape look like in these markets? How profitable are each of these chemicals? What countries do they sell these chemicals into?

&gt; Last year they invested a lot in producing tires. 

Have they always produced tires? How much did they invest in producing tires? What did they do with the money; expand existing capacity or build new plants? How much revenue comes from making tires? What are their Gross and Operating Margins in this segment?


&gt;They made two acquisitions (small companies) and they both were somewhat related to the auto industry. 

What business were these acquisitions in? How much should they contribute to Lanxess in terms of revenue and earnings? How much did Lanxess pay for these businesses? Was is smart that Lanxess bought these businesses? Does Lanxess have a history of making good or bad acquisitions?

&gt;In their annual report last week they said they had worse than expected sales due to low demand from car manufacturers, for example their tire sales went down 40%.

Are most of their customers in Europe? What is your position on where Europe is in the business cycle? What are their contracts like with these customers? Who is their competition for these customers? What is Lanxess' cost structure compared to those competitors? I would expect manufacturers with operations in the US to have lower costs in the US due to structurally lower energy costs. Do US manufacturers ship tires to Europe? What marketshare does Lanxess have in all of their markets?

&gt;It's P/E went from 10.01 to 8.95 so now it's cheap (or in decline)

Just because the P/E is low doesn't mean that the business is in decline or that its cheap. Moreover, a 10% change in P/E multiple isn't an enormous move. Cyclical companies can trade at very low P/E multiples when earnings are high in the latter portion of the business cycle.  Where do you think we are in the business cycle? What are the 10 year normalized earnings/FCF for Lanxess? What are the average EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, EV/FCF, and P/E for Lanxess over the business cycle?

&gt;Their profit for 2012 (=514) was record high and higher than in 2011 (=506), the problem is that it was expected they would earn more. Still, the fact that they've never been as profitable as they are now should be a good sign.

Profits reaching record highs should be expected in all companies at some point. Moreover, this should be expected in cyclical companies at the later stages of the business cycle. This is not as important as you think it is.

&gt;Their ROA and ROE is lower than in 2011 but only by a bit, and is higher than in 2010. So if it wasn't for the poor sales, I'd say they're getting more efficient.

What evidence do you have to say they're getting more efficient? Did capacity utilization at their plants increase? Did prices for their products get higher? Did costs get lower? Did they restructure in anyway?  There are many reasons why ROA and ROE can increase. You did not look at the underlying business so you have nothing to anchor this statement on.

&gt;The company was created as a spin-off from Bayer in 2005, and after going through a messy period they started giving out dividends in 2006 and never stopped. The dividend per share went up from 0.25 in 2006 to 1.00 euro this year

Is this dividend sustainable? What percentage of normalized FCF is this 1 euro dividend?

&gt;Their EPS is 113% higher than the average for the previous 5 years, and 2361% higher than in the period 2005-2009

2008-2009 was the bottom of the cycle so earnings should be negative here. You admitted that the company was a mess in 2005. 3 of the 5 years in your sample should be horrible.  Is it still impressive that earnings are up an absurd amount on a very low number? Is this growth coming from getting more customers? Is this coming from operational efficiency? Is this coming from a reversion to mean?

&gt;Profit/Debt is 31.5% for 2012 and has been steadily growing since 2006.

If profit/debt is growing the company is getting more levered. Is that a good thing for a cyclical company? How much debt can this business support? What is the capital structure of this company? Is the capital structure sustainable in the face of continued economic weakness in the EU? This could also be one of the reasons that ROE is increasing.

&gt;According to Graham's formula for determining the stock's intrinsic value, it's 53.52 EUR. Its current stock price now is 55.05 so it's pretty close, it's not overpriced

If what you're saying is true then the stock is overpriced as it's trading for more that the Graham formula. Moreover, you'd want the company to be trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value before you buy, not a premium.

&gt;ROIC is 5.89% which is ""just right"" (more than 6% would be ideal)

I'd like it alot more if the ROIC was 20%. Why is 5.89% just right? That return is too low to cover your cost of capital. Growing businesses whose return on capital is less than their cost of capital destroy value. What is the average ROIC for Lanxess over the past 10 years?


Pretty much none of what you posted makes me want to buy Lanxess or look at it further. I know that sounds harsh, but you have much more work to do before you have sufficient information to make an investment decision. Work on answering the questions posed and you'll have a much better understanding of the company and industry Lanxess sells into. Most of the time you look at companies and end up not finding anything. This may be one of those times. 

Repost your revised analysis after you have a more compelling thesis. We appreciate compelling ideas and want to keep the quality of posts in this sub as high as possible."
2013-04-03 09:21:24,"Thanks everyone for your input, I've enjoyed reading the different opinions.  From what has been discussed here there seems to be two ways to look at this.

* Anyway you can increase EPS is a good thing.

* Increasing EPS via balance sheet accounting is not the best use of borrowed capital.  I fall into this category as I prefer a company to increase its operating earnings.   I've been long on HD since early 2008.

I asked a good friend of mine to run some numbers on this and got the following results and would welcome feedback.  Based on his numbers I still don't see the benefit in this transaction.

2013-04-03 03:28:15,"This is a dangerous view to have. EPS accretion through leverage is not a sustainable value driver, buying shares at a discount to fair value creates value for non-selling holders. There is considerable research about poor repurchase timing by management teams. Have you read BRK's 2011 letter?"
2013-04-03 03:09:55,"One thing not mentioned is the fact that interest rates are so low currently. I also bet, and so do many others, that big inflation is coming. This of course then causes interest rates to rise making debt attractive now as opposed to later. Additionally, the tax advantages of debt vs equity is quite nice!"
2013-04-02 21:11:38,"It really depends. I prefer a quick and dirty DCF, but that's just me.

It really depends on how you look at the stock.

EV/EBITDA is good for retailers in general, but Home Depot is huge, and it isn't going private any time soon, so an unlevered multiple isn't necessarily the best way to value it. I'd favor EV/EBITDA if I felt that:

1) HD was a takeover candidate

2) HD was underlevered, and could do a larger dividend recapitalization or levered repurchase to boost shareholder value.

I don't think HD is a takeover candidate, nor do I think it's a poor allocator in need of an activist to encourage it to make better use of capital. In fact, HD has been one of the best companies at returning shareholder cash to its owners. So EV/EBITDA, for me, would be out for HD. I'd instead do a DCF analysis and go from there.

2013-04-02 17:06:32,"&gt;Asness notes that the selection of a ten-year average is arbitrary

This isn't true as far as I know. Choosing exactly ten years (which, admittedly, sounds like an arbitrary, nice round number) of earnings gives the highest predicting power over the next years' market return. The study that shows that is available online, I think somewhere in the ""vanguard"" website.

Apart from that, IMO, you should do any juggling at all with a measure that is intrinsecally inaccurate because you would be defeating its usefulness. Women didn't incorporate to the job market until 50? years ago and you could produce a myriad of caveats more. What is sure in any case is that the US won't be growing at 3%. Few factors affecting GDP growth are easier to predict than the shape of the population pyramid in the next few decades."

2013-04-02 14:24:08,"Ive been long hd since 2009.  If issuing debt to buy back stock is so brilliant then why didnt they do it when the stock was wildly undervalued?

A common street wide poor management decision is to lever up to buy back stock when your companies stock is at a high.  And halt buy backs when a stock is undervalued and has fallen a lot (to conserve capital).

This why its so easy to go to google and find numerous studies on how large companies are absolutely retarded when it comes to trading their own stock.

The fact that you just immeaditely dismiss my distaste for this kind of frequently stupid decision making because you think i dont know it raises eps shows me all i need to know about your ability to see the bigger picture.  Or inability i should say."

2013-04-02 13:47:14,"First, let me admit that I don't follow HD that closely. That said, like most retailers, HD generates more in free cash flow than it generates in GAAP earnings - $5.6 billion in FCF vs $4.5 billion in earnings in 2012. So P/E isn't necessarily the best way to look at their earnings power.

Also, Home Depot's forward earnings projections (yeah, yeah, I know, forward earnings...) are much higher. HD trades at about 17x forward estimates.

Earnings can grow. Home Depots earnings are growing. So, over time, the spread between the rate paid on its debt and the earnings yield should also grow, enriching shareholders.

Home Depot is issuing debt really cheap. From your article: 

&gt;$1 billion of securities due 2023 that may yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal amount of 30-year debt that may pay a spread of 110 basis points.

HD's debt will cost the company something like 2.70% for the 10 year issues and 4.1% over 30 years. Any way you slice it, shareholders are winning here.

2013-04-01 11:09:57,"I'd second the person that recommended you buy an accounting book or take an intro course, it's helpful to buckle down the basics on this stuff.

Book value is simply: Total assets - total liabilities - preferred stock.

Book value is what's left over for shareholders, so net assets and liabilites and what ever is left is equity.

FCF, the absolute best way is CFO (with averaged working capital changes) - maint capex

I'm not sure what you're going with on the stability.  If a company has consistent EPS does that mean they're better than something where they're changing?  I think stability is a myth, unless you're looking at preferreds or some sort of an income hybrid I'd focus on why the company is worth investing in, and what are the driving forces behind it's numbers."
2013-04-01 09:05:53,"&gt; Why is 18.74 wrong for 2010?

18.74 has to be wrong because pharma trades in the single digits to low doubles, an 18x multiple would be a massive outlier and I know Bayer isn't. 


Book value is the value at which they are carrying these things though, and depreciation and amortisation are not necessarily accurate measures of value decline. What matters for book value from a value investor perspective is how much these things are actually worth. Bayer's biggest assets are their patents; are they amortising these properly? Could they sell them tomorrow for their carrying value?

&gt; I'm not sure how it can be above 1

Market cap not price

&gt; I don't know, why is it bad?

EPS is bad because net income is notoriously easy to manipulate through accounting tricks. It can also be a problem because of stock splits, one-off adjustments, non-recurring charges, etc.

&gt; I've read somewhere that it's not really a very good metric 

That's just not true. It's an easy proxy for FCF, and is the *go to* valuation metric in most industries outside of FIG. If you ask a professional where a company is trading, the answer will almost certainly be given as an EV/EBITDA multiple.

&gt;  For example, Novartis has 14.2, so it's more overpriced than Bayer. However, I was told that EV/EBITDA should mostly be used for telecommunication or energy companies, so it shouldn't matter much for a pharmaceutical company.

Novartis isn't ""more overpriced"" than Bayer, it's a different company. They have Alcon! And you should *never* look at historical ratios, only forward ones; investors care about a company's future prospects, not what it did in the past. They don't have a claim to those earnings. 

And EV/EBITDA is huge for pharma!! Massively so!

&gt;I don't think that I should understand how an industry works in order to invest.

But you do. You don't need to know the details, but you need to know the basics, which you can get from an industry primer. You need to understand what drives growth and sales, and what matters for valuing companies in that industry. For instance, depreciation is much more important for industrials than it is for media.

&gt; Also their profitability, ROA and ROE are diminishing year on year since 2007. Like I said, I could've figured this out from the Excel sheet, instead of wasting a day on reading the report.

But *why*? They are diminishing *because* of patent cliffs. But just because they are diminishing doesn't mean it's a bad investment!! What matters is whether investors have over- or under-compensated for this.

And you don't need to read the whole AR. You should read ER on the company first though to try to understand what their challenges and strengths are."

2013-04-01 05:41:57,"Fair enough. I probably didn't explain what was the point of my original question. I asked only the stuff which I wasn't sure if I calculated right. For EV/EBITDA, I knew that I did it right since it's obvious how to calculate it. 

Why is 18.74 wrong for 2010? They had a low EBITDA and low profit, you can notice that immediately compared to the years before and after. At the same time their share price remained the same (see how even the P/E was exceptionally high). Note that I only took random share prices from July and December of 2010. It's possible that it went up and down a lot during that time, so maybe at one time they had a P/E of 5... I wouldn't know. But it doesn't really matter if you look at it long term.

&gt; why you would care about book value

Good question about the book value. I went back to make sure I got it right and noticed that from 2004 I got the depreciation wrong, I wrote positive instead of negative numbers.

Book value is what the company would be worth if it returned all its debt and then it sold all its physical assets like chairs and buildings. The intangible assets are not counted in since they cannot be sold at an auction.

I was asking about this formula because I wasn't sure if I got it right:

Book value = Total assets + Depreciation - Other current assets - Debt

* Depreciation is a negative value so I add it to Total assets instead of subtracting it.
* Other current assets is goodwill, which needs to be subtracted from the Total assets.

P/BV needs to be above 1, otherwise it's overpriced. However, I'm not sure if I got this value right. Price is, for example, $50, and Book value is 24 billion... I'm not sure how it can be above 1.

&gt; why EPS is actually a bad metric of earnings?

I don't know, why is it bad? Seems like a pretty good metric to see if their earnings are going up in a 10 year period.

&gt; Do you even know what EV or EBITDA are?

EBITDA is earning before income taxes and depreciation. It shows how much the company would've earned if it didn't have to pay taxes and had no capital expenditures. I've read somewhere that it's not really a very good metric because it's possible to have a positive EBITDA, but the profit can still be negative. The only thing important about it is that is should remain positive at all times, if it's negative then the company has some serious issues.

EV shows the market price of the company, in theory how much would someone have to pay in order to take over 100% of the company. It's shares * share price + debt - cash, which makes sense since you would have to buy all the shares at the current price, take on the company's debt as an added expense, but you would get the company's available cash so it's an income.

&gt; You didn't even mention EV/EBITDA, which is one of the key metrics

EV/EBITDA is something similar to the P/E ratio, it shows if the stock price is cheap or expensive compared to other companies. For example, Novartis has 14.2, so it's more overpriced than Bayer. However, I was told that EV/EBITDA should mostly be used for telecommunication or energy companies, so it shouldn't matter much for a pharmaceutical company.

&gt; Do you understand pharma?

I don't think that I should understand how an industry works in order to invest. What if I have shares of 20 different companies, all different from each other because of diversification? Should I learn everything there is to know about the textile industry, car manufacturing, spaceflight, etc. before I invest in any of those? That's not really possible...

&gt; Do you understand the basics of investing? 

I've read a few books and based on my investments so far I've made more money than lost. Some of this was only luck, which is why I'd like to learn more, hence this thread.

&gt; Do you understand the basics of accounting?

I think I should learn more, but what I know so far should already be enough to recognize when a company is overpriced or in serious trouble.

&gt; Can you tell me what a patent cliff is and why you should care?

It's when their patent expires and other generic drugs producers start making their drugs at a cheaper price, so they lose profit. I've read about this in the Novartis report. Like I said, I haven't gone into analyzing Bayer because I want to know from these numbers if I should waste my time at all. And the numbers tell me that I shouldn't. I did a similar thing with Novartis, made an Excel sheet like this, noticed that something is wrong, but decided to read their annual report anyway. After going through like 100 pages it turned out that they indeed have problems for 2013... for example, the case you mentioned. One of their competitors was not approved for a drug in 2012 so they made extra profit, but they're expecting to make extra losses if another competitor does get approved in February. And then I looked at the news and saw that indeed, the competitor's drug was approved.

Also their profitability, ROA and ROE are diminishing year on year since 2007. Like I said, I could've figured this out from the Excel sheet, instead of wasting a day on reading the report."
2013-03-31 22:20:01,"OK, I thought about answering your questions, but you really are not nearly sophisticated enough to be making investing decisions on your own yet. Here are two questions:

1) What is the point of this 10 year income statement? Do you understand *what* these various metrics show you? Can you explain to me *why* you would care about book value, *why* EPS is actually a bad metric of earnings? You didn't even mention EV/EBITDA, which is one of the *key* metrics, and I can tell you right now 18.74 has to be wrong for 2010. Do you even know what EV or EBITDA are?  
2) What do you think you will learn from the AR? ARs are sales documents; they contain legal disclosures and can provide useful info, but only if you know what you're looking for. Even if you aren't going to buy Bayer though, I'd read the AR. It is technically 200 pages, but a lot will be pictures, and you can scan the rest

Do you understand pharma? Do you understand the basics of investing? Do you understand the basics of accounting? Until you can answer these, you shouldn't be investing. Working through spreadsheets is great for learning, and asking questions is good, but you're asking all the *wrong* questions. You should *never* invest based on historical data, *especially* in pharma due to patent cliffs. Can you tell me what a patent cliff is and why you should care? Because everyone else who is trying to beat you at investing can. 10 hours a day is not nearly enough to say you can't learn this stuff.

I'm actually confident about most of the stuff I did here, I'm only not sure if I got the formula for the Book value right. I can't take an accounting course since I work 10h/day...

Anyway, before reading a 200 page annual report I think it's better first to just get the data for the past 10 years and if it looks all right then I'll read the report for 2012. For example, in the case of Bayer, I see that they don't have stable profit growth, their cash flow and profitability declined this year, while the stock price went up and now they have a P/E of 27.19, so I don't think I should read their full report cause I won't buy their stock."

2) kind of wrong, interest is an expense too as well as taxes. These other expenses should be included in analysis and expenses should be categorized to see where it is growing or shrinking.

4) I have seen different ways to calculate free cash flow, but take a look at the cash flow report or simply google free cash flow. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow ...as you can see multiple different forms.

...after reading your other questions I think you should just take a financial accounting course. It's an easy class and quite useful in almost eveyrthing you do.

2012-06-25 12:56:42,"&gt;You can only know how accurate your inputs are ex-post, so I'd want a simpler system to implement to determine position size.
  
Good point, I've needlessly complicated the process.
  
&gt;Although these are just rough estimates, they can be a guide for me to use when determining position size. As I get more data about my record, I can adjust these winning probabilities as needed.
  
I'm starting to agree that this is the best way to incorporate Kelly, by using rough estimates and using the Kelly number as a yardstick when determining position size. Then over time the accuracy of this yardstick measurement will (hopefully) improve. "
2012-06-25 12:50:21,"&gt;You can assign probabilities to the accuracy of your inputs and reduce Kelly to lower percentage to account for possible mis-estimates.

&gt;Let's say you're about 75% confident that the $15 bull case price target is correct. But there is a 25% chance that it will fall between $11-$14:

&gt;(.75 * $15)+(.25 * Average($11:$14))
would yield an adjusted bull case price target of: $14.375

&gt;which would adjust your Kelly number down to:

&gt;Edge = (50% * ($14.375-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.1875 Odds = $4.375 f = 27%

&gt;You could then adjust all your inputs for the probability of them being accurate.

This model has too many moving parts for me.  It's hard enough to assess ""winning"" probabilities in the bull/bear cases. I would now have to assign another probability to how confident I am in my valuation.  On top of this, you attach a valuation range to your probability where I might not have pulled the trigger to invest.  Additionally, I would sandbag one of the inputs to the valuation (multiples, growth rate, market share, margins, WACC, recovery rates, normalized earnings power, etc) to adjust how confident I am, rather than attaching another probability at the end of the calculation.  The process has a false precision where the extra inputs could be an additional a source of error.  You can only know how accurate your inputs are ex-post, so I'd want a simpler system to implement to determine position size.

I know my record.  I'm an average stock picker.  Most of my investments go nowhere, and fortunately my big winners outpace my big losers. Using my record alone, the only way I get a higher winning percentage is if the investment situation is different from the norm.  I think of my winning probabilities like this:

Special Situations (Bankruptcy Reorg, Spinoffs, Tender Offers, Liquidations, Risk Arb) - 65-95% 

Equity With Other Catalyst (Increased Distribution, Earnings Beat, Temporary Crisis, Legal Judgement in Company's Favor, etc) - 50-65% 

Equity With No Catalyst - 50%

I'm anchoring on the relative certainty or merger arb situations to handicap the probabilities in other equity investment situations.  Although these are just rough estimates, they can be a guide for me to use when determining position size.  As I get more data about my record, I can adjust these winning probabilities as needed.

For bull case valuation I would stick to what I already do.  I'd want to find investments where I can purchase equity for at least a 1/3 discount to my assessment of intrinsic value.

Bear case valuation method would depend on the type of company I'm investing in.  My valuation would be based a normal worst case scenario for the company.  If the company is a net-net I would choose liquidation value as a bear case.  If it is a cyclical company, my bear case valuation would revolve around earnings power at a discount to normalized margins/multiples.  If its a faster growing company, my bear case valuation would revolve around slower growth rates and smaller margins.

This is new for me as well.  Let's see how I can incorporate this into my current mock portfolio. "

2012-06-25 12:23:20,"Hell of a presentation, thanks for posting"
2012-06-25 08:55:30,"Wow, excellent post. I agree spot on with your evaluation of using Kelly for M&amp;A deals, where both the bull price and bear price are reasonably obvious, and the probability of ""winning"" is more certain.
  
For normal equity investments, the two inputs of:  
1. the bull/bear prices  
2. the probability of ""winning""  
are much less certain to estimate. 
I'm not comfortable using a 50/50 split as a probability of ""winning"". How do you or I know that is an accurate percentage?  
  
Additionally the bull/bear case prices are not easy to identify. Two analysts can come to different intrinsic values for a certain stock. And that being said, the market may price the stock completely differently (both in a bull and a bear case). 
  
I agree with your final insights: Kelly inspires much more confidence in its results when (a) the risk/return or probability of winning is high, AND when you can achieve a high level of accuracy when measuring the inputs. In these cases I would be comfortable using a Kelly value that is closer to the true Kelly value. (i.e. 3/4ths Kelly, etc.)
  
Additionally I would say that the use of Kelly in less-certain circumstances still has value! For example take your calculation:
  

Edge = (50% * ($15-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.5  
Odds = $5  
f = 30%  
  
You can assign probabilities to the accuracy of your inputs and reduce Kelly to lower percentage to account for possible mis-estimates.
  
Let's say you're about 75% confident that the $15 bull case price target is correct. But there is a 25% chance that it will fall between $11-$14:
  
(.75 * $15)+(.25 * Average($11:$14))  
would yield an adjusted bull case price target of: $14.375

which would adjust your Kelly number down to:
  
Edge = (50% * ($14.375-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.1875
Odds = $4.375
f = 27%
  
You could then adjust all your inputs for the probability of them being accurate. "
2012-06-24 23:47:35,"I thought alot about this in the past couple of days because I also didn't know how to start quantifying the probability of ""winning"".  I thought of something that will help us both.

I dabble in merger arbitrage with smaller companies as the spreads are usually large enough to warrant investigation.  I usually only look at friendly, cash, acquisitions for investment.  I estimate the probability of these deals closing at 90+% (95+% after the acquirer secures financing).  You can find research papers that elaborate on price implied M&amp;A closing odds, [M&amp;A closing odds based on characteristics of transactions](http://people.hbs.edu/mbaker/cv/papers/arbitrage.pdf), as well as the actual records of successful M&amp;A transaction closings in different time periods.  Those estimates will come in around the figures cited.  In situations like this, it is easy see how large of a position the Kelly Criterion recommends.

For example, [On May 14th, 2012, TII Network Technologies (NSDQ:TIII) agreed to be acquired by Kelta, Inc for $2.15/share](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/TIII.O/key-developments/article/2540236).  Before the announcement, TIII was trading at $1.45.  This deal is not predicated on Kelta finding financing as they have enough cash and credit to consummate the transaction currently.  In the days after the announcement, you could have easily bought shares for $2.06 and they expect the deal to close in the 3rd quarter of 2012.  With this investment, you have a prospective 14% unlevered annualized return opportunity and enough information to plug into the Kelly Formula.

Kelly Formula: f(Position Size) = Edge/Odds

Since this is a friendly, cash only, takeover not subject to financing, I'll peg the probability of this transaction closing at 95%.  Let's assume that if the deal doesn't close, TIII will trade at its price before the acquisition announcement, $1.45/share.  Therefore:

Edge = (95% * ($2.15-$2.06)) + (5% * ($1.45-2.06)) = $.055

Odds = $.09

f = 61.1%

It's easy to see why many use half/modified Kelly positions as a 61% position in any security would make me uncomfortable.

Now, you will not find equity investments where you have a 90% probability of winning outside of merger arbitrage and other special situations.  [CXO Advisory follows ""guru"" bullish/bearish statements](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/#notes).  The rockstar gurus are right 66% of the time.  The average guru is right 48% of the time.  Although their ""study"" is colloquial and more macro than micro in nature, it mirrors the pronouncement I've heard; ""You are absolutely killing it if your stock picks are right 60% of the time.""  Since I'm definitely not a rockstar guru, and my long term track record doesn't show abnormal stock picking skill, I will always say my probability of ""winning"" is 50/50 in normal equity investments.

After all the previous setup info, let's go back to your example you posed (Stock XYZ trades at $10/share and you value it at $15/share).  You still need to calculate a bear case return to effectively use the Kelly Formula.  Let's say in the worst case scenario, the company liquidates and brings in $8/share to equity holders.

Edge = (50% * ($15-$10)) + (50% * ($8-10)) = $1.5

Odds = $5

f = 30%

Lastly, the insight I get from the Kelly Criterion is that investors should focus on situations where the return/risk is very high, or the probability of winning is very high.  Sometimes I hear analysts cite return/risk ratios when pitching investments.  It is now obvious to me why they do this.

Both of us should now be able to put the Kelly formula to good use."

2012-06-22 19:43:28,"The upward price mobility depends on if you think that the people that are shorting the stock are right or wrong.  If they're right, the stock will keep going down.  If they're wrong, the stock should rip upwards in a short squeeze at some point in the future.

[Nasdaq has a website where you can view the short interest in a stock](http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx).  This information is updated every 2 weeks with a 2 week delay, i think.  You can use this to back into how much institutional ownership a stock has.

Using SVU as an example, [it has 103.3M shares sold short](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/svu/short-interest).  That's 48.6% of shares sold short.  Using the 111% figure cited above, SVU actually has 62.4% institutional ownership."
2012-06-22 18:20:59,"wow i never even thought of that. makes complete sense.  now in terms of reading into that, would it be safe to say that those over 100% have more question marks in terms of upward price mobility than most ""winner"" stocks that hover around 70% ownership (ie. GOOG/AAPL/etc.)? or is it that, regardless of percentage, some of the ownership could be long and some short- ie. even a stock that has 11% ownership could all be on the short side? and is there a website that breaks down the ownership details in this regard?"
2012-06-22 18:14:18,"It means the security has high institutional ownership and it is also being shorted.

When you think of the mechanics of shorting, a individual (or institution) borrows shares from another investor (or institution) and sells those shares back into the market.  As a result, more than one person can ""own"" the same shares due to shorting.  

[For instance, SVU is at 111%](http://www.google.com/finance?q=SVU)."

Owner earnings formula doesn't actually say that you have a terrible year in years that you make large capital investments because it doesn't actually use cashflow, but net income excluding depreciation.  So you never subtract from performance capital expenditures.  So you have no impact on ""performance"" in spending years, and a nice impact on subsequent years.

The reason net income (including depreciation) is fine, is that you are likely to need to replace the depreciated asset near the end of its depreciated life, so it is a decent estimate of future cash outflows."
