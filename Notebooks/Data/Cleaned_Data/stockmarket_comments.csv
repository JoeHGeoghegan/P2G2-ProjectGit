2014-01-30 17:28:33,aka a potential buying opportunity
2014-01-30 17:26:55,"Hahaha no offense taken whatsoever. I personally wish I waited a bit to buy it, but $1.70 is so cheap I couldn't pass it up. I hope you're right about that. Thank you!"

2014-01-30 15:49:26,"Might put a small position on at $1.40, but I (no offence) would like to see it drop to $1.20. Sounds like petty numbers but if it actually makes it to $5+ the extra 20 cents a share difference turns into a bigger deal. 

If I miss it, and it doesn't get under $1.40 then it's my own fault and I won't have as many shares as I would have liked. It's what ever. 

Good luck man, I think you have a good summer sell coming. :)"

2014-01-30 12:12:33,"I worked at one of their biggest mines in Canada (Northern Ontario) last year on my work term for school. I was dumbfounded by how much money gets thrown around out there but I guess that's just the nature of the mining industry. Anyways, I realized how crappy the company was doing from some of the supervisors out there I'd talk to (mostly due to gold being priced so low) and bought in around $17.45. It might be a good long term investment if gold decides to go up again eventually but I wouldn't expect anything soon. Also realize that they are very unproductive during the winter months, at least for mine expansions. We had to put the project on hold because of the weather and not being able to get enough work done in it. "
2014-01-30 12:10:49,uhh.. what? You said you were short 1785 and you just added above 1790... How could you possibly have just lowered your average?? I dont think the high is in yet but good luck with whatever you are doing over there.

2014-01-30 11:42:35,Glad I didn't panick sell.
2014-01-30 11:42:03,"Any action above $20 would technically be very significant, so until that happens, I would wait on the sidelines.

ABX has had a terrible couple of months, but the fact that the $15 support held is a good indication that some buyers are nibbling.

2014-01-29 23:56:56,"I think people are automatically assuming QE is pumping directly into the markets and that simply isn't true.  You have to think of the trickle down theory. There is no incentive for banks to lend with low interest rates. I think over time you will see the effects of QE once it is profitable. If you think about it, about 2.5T is sitting in reserves as of Dec. 2013, up from 1.5T in Dec. 2012. However, if you look at circulation that 1T...that ratio is completely screwed. Circulation was around 1.1T in Dec. 2012 and barely 1.2T in Dec. 2013. 

Obviously there is more to this, but if you think about housing in some of the major metropolitan areas, they've already returned to 2006-2007 levels if not higher. S&amp;P500 was sitting at all time highs at one point in 2013 and to me a lot of that had to do with that little spike in interest last year and that addition 100b that made its way into circulation. Imagine another 300-400b making its way down as interest starts to increase. Circulation from 2010-2011 was around 800b for comparison. 

Now I'm not directly saying I'm bullish. There are reproductions to actions like these. I think the market will be trader dominant over the course of the Fed tapering, meaning that you will see fluctuations in the short run based on long term macro events. Simply put, if I can build a position on dips on something I intend to hold 10-15 years down the road I would do that, particularly financials. "

Buy at a low, sell when it gets close to your predicted max, and then if you can find any shares, short the dump. I'm telling you, it's exciting.

- Why you believe that it is a good investment (With concrete, tangible examples).
- When you believe you should cash out (i.e. when/why do you believe it is no longer a good investment when it reaches a certain point)
- Things you plan to monitor closely to ensure that you continue to be accurate in your reasoning.

Hope that helps!"

Such unexpected moves could have investors caught short historically weak names or vice versa long historically strong names.  Thus the potential for a tradable opportunity exists.

But if you are just trying to keep up with the inflation and maybe make some extra, then spread your money around these companies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average

2013-01-10 12:56:12,"start with the income statement. look for trends in top line revenue and bottom line profitabilty. if a company seems to being growing nicely and profitably double check the balance sheet and make sure that they have enough assets or revenue coming in to cover their liabilities.  I find vuru.co is good for identifying trends, but dont always agreee with their ratinggs and price targets. if you dont trust your own research you can always invest in a bigger company that will grow a little and yield some income like a wal-mart or mcdonalds. while you wont get awesome returns and get rich over night, you will preserve your capital and be less exposed to risk. the concept most people dont get: compounding returns. think of it this way--- lose 50% of your initial investment... takes 100% growth to get back to where you were. your investment should really depend on how much capital you're willing to risk and what kind of return you desire. look into the sharpe ratio: maximizing return for minimal risk. "

2013-01-10 12:35:18,"depends on the time horizon, amount of risk you're willing to take, and whether you're investing in growth or income. I assume since you only have a few thousand you are probably looking for growth. If you can afford to lose the capital, at your age I would speculate and put it into something that could potentially hit big. I like CPSS, HK, OPK and GTAT in that order. but due your due diligence on the companies. there is no reason to assume random people on the internet know anymore than you do. "

Based on my research, ThermoDox is their only drug candidate. But it has been applied to different cancers, including liver, breast and etc. The study for primary liver cancer is at phase 3 and the other studies are at phase 2.  The main component of the drug is Doxorubicin, which is an approved cancer drug for leukemia and such. The innovation of ThermoDox is the new delivery method called liposomal encapsulation. Similarly, there is a drug called Myocet (available in Europe and Canada, not the States), which is another liposomal doxorubicin used for breast cancer treatment. And based on my understanding of the mechanism of doxorubicin, it targets on the process of DNA replication, and quite versatile. So In my opinion, the chance of positive phase 3 results is pretty high. But you never know for sure."

2015-02-14 20:28:50,"I wasn't accusing you of cherry picking. In fact, I wasn't even taking issue with your questioning how good analysts' calls are. I was really just chiming in on the general subject in hopes that some might actually read what I said, realize that there's more to the subject than they thought, look further into it, learn some things, and be better off for the effort.

A few thoughts on your points ...

Analyzing any large company is complex, and consistently accurately predicting its financial performance, both with the exacting precision, and the narrow focus on short time frames that the ridiculous quarterly-reporting system requires, is inherently an impossible task. So, analysts are only analysts because they can get much closer at doing those things than everyone else.

We also have to remember that analysts can only model financials and evaluate the quality of management as determinants of long-term stock valuation ... they cannot predict what dictates stock prices in the short term, which is purely human emotion (a.k.a. sentiment). If some piece of news came out tomorrow that caused investors to panic and drop AAPL stock to $10, that would not mean that the analysts were ""wrong"" about the true value of the stock. And, the recent collapse in the energy commodities market is another example. No one could've accurately predicted the timing, severity and length of the worse crash in oil and natural gas in decades."

To be clear, I'm actually not discouraging you ... just pointing out how important it is that you understand that what you would be doing with your $10k is just shy of betting it all on red at the roulette table, and is by no means ""investing."" At least read a half dozen research reports from the professional analysts who cover the company ... and not just the ones who are as enamored with the company as you."
2015-02-14 18:55:25,"Yup, that's it ... just in case you don't believe it if you only hear it from one person."
2015-02-14 18:51:04,"Many investors like to blame their own failings on analysts' ratings, but the truth is that, while analysts are indeed wrong sometimes, more often than not, the far bigger problem is investors' own lack of understanding and general misuse of the system. There are many ways that is the case, but a couple of examples ...

Most analysts' ratings are accompanied by a suitability rating ... you may have never heard of that because 90% of people gloss right over them and just look at the buy/sell rating and the price target, without even reading the research report those shorthand conclusions come from. For example, a stock can be rated ""strong buy"" yet also rated something like ""high risk"" or ""aggressive"" in order to make the distinction that the stock is only a ""strong buy"" for aggressive institutional investors and/or professional traders, not the average Joe Retiree. Yet, greed makes Joe only see the strong buy rating and price target, not the suitability rating.

Related to that, making any investment decision based on an analyst's rating and/or without reading the research report the rating came from is the equivalent of reading a headline about a legal case and deciding who should win the case ... not only did you not even bother to read the article, but you failed to recognize that the article is only one non-lawyer's interpretation of a tiny fraction of the actual total facts of the case, without the rest of which it is literally impossible to make even a remotely accurate judgment. The proper way to use analysts' ratings is to read at least two full reports (usually several pages each) from tier-one firms, but still only consider the consensus rating and price target from all analysts combined."
2015-02-14 18:19:16,"&gt; 1. What exactly is the guidance? Is that a particular document or just some comment? If it's a document, is it included in SEC filing document?

Guidance is the management team's estimates for revenue and EPS (and sometimes a whole range of other financial and/or operational information). Some companies issue particular documents that have ""guidance"" in the title, but that's somewhat rare. As an example, see Aetna's ""guidance summary"" documents [here] (http://investor.aetna.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110617&amp;p=irol-reportsOther). More often, when guidance is issued, it is in the form of a comment within each earnings release and/or conference call, sometimes only on an annual basis, but more often quarterly. Additionally, it will often be in a 10Q or 8K filing that accompanies/follows an earnings release.The protocol differs somewhat for each company, so it's best to get familiar with the practices of each company in which you have a stake.

Regarding MU, ""Q2 guidance was light"" means that the guidance the company issued for Q2 is below the consensus expectation from the analysts that issue research reports on the company. From the quote you posted, it's unclear whether it is the revenue, EPS or both that has now been guided lower than analysts' previous expectations. It is a fairly common occurrence and wording."

2015-02-14 14:21:40,"In this case, and I could be wrong since I come from a European context, but I would equate that to its internal forecasts for Q2 revenues, meaning they're not expected to be that great over last fiscal year's Q2. I've never heard the phrase that guidance could be light, though - definitely a new one for me. "

2015-02-14 00:36:55,"I wonder if the 10k of ""savings right now"" is ""new"" money for investment, or if it's all the money you saved up over the years.

If it's new money, or money you are willing to lose in a risky investment, then ""investing"" all of it in TSLA is like gambling that isn't a serious investment or savings plan. TSLA has a lot of competition, and any new company developing new products is a risky investment. Serious financial managers would not have TSLA be any more than 5 percent of their stock portfolio.

If the 10k is money needed within the next 30 or so years, such as part of a life-long retirement saving plan, then investing in a index mutual fund with a low expense ratio maybe the best idea for the next few years.  Maybe buy $500 worth of TSLA, but plan to keep it long term because the cost of each buy or sell trade can be significant for only $500 worth of TSLA stock. Good luck.

&gt;The __DeLorean DMC-12__ (commonly referred to simply as __the DeLorean__ as it was the only model ever produced by the company) is an American [sports car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car) manufactured by [John DeLorean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeLorean)'s [DeLorean Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_Motor_Company) for the American market from 1981–83. The car features [gull-wing doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull-wing_door), and an innovative fiberglass chassis and underbody structure, along with a brushed [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel) body. The car became widely known and iconic for its appearance as a [modified time machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine) in the [*Back to the Future* film trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_(franchise\))*.*

2015-02-13 23:27:23,"Your guess about profit margin seems to be the best answer to why Costco has no Apple products.  I guess Costco and their customers see Apple products as overpriced.

About me it's customer loyalty that Costco loses.  I find it hard to justify buying a Costco card when I'm shopping for a smart phone and computer and see Costco ads for Samsung Galaxy, Verizon Droid by Motorola, HP, Windows, Dell Inspiration and many more names other than Apple.  I found a better deal for the PC I wanted elsewhere, and had to go elsewhere for iPhones or a MacBook Pro.  I'd thought Apple products would bring more customers to Costco, but reading about the stores being so busy, maybe their keeping value products instead of expensive brand names maybe more successful in winning customer loyalty. They would probably have to sell iPhones at a loss to win more value seeking customers.

"
2015-02-13 22:52:51,"No not really. But if you want to put that much into a company you need nerves of steel. You can't let the day to day fluctuations get to you. You have to think about 5-10-15 years. You have to play the long game. 

Remember fortunes are made in concentration and maintained in diversification. "
2015-02-13 22:47:52,"if 10k were 10% of your potential investment, I'd say investing it in TSLA would be a gamble.....it may likely pay off, but it's still risky. Investing everything you own in TSLA is insane.

If you want to own some TSLA but 5 shares, max. Invest the other 9k in mutual funds. "

2015-02-13 20:23:30,"I don't know if it was Buffet or Graham that said investing should be thought of like playing baseball without called strikes. You can wait as long as you want for the right pitch.

For me, I like some reassurance that the company won't disappear in the time frame that I want to invest, which is typically very far in the future.

We all know Elon Musk is tremendous businessman having an almost religious conviction in his product, but let's look at the market; his competition. We have several car manufacturers out there now, they are very well established with deep pockets and even deeper R&amp;D capabilities. So what happens if/when they release the electric cars that will directly compete against Tesla?

Right now, Tesla is still stuck in that stuffy luxury car niche; competing against Mercedes, Audi, BMW. In this short amount of time, the Tesla brand has become more and more popular, but their production is still lagging anything to be considered a legitimate threat to luxury auto makers. Their results from last quarter also fell short from reaching what analysts thought they would be on track to produce. This has a lot of people hesitant.

Tesla stock has priced in some extreme growth for the company; growth that has yet to materialize except in market valuation. In the end, what really determines the movement of this stock beyond its fifteen minutes of fame is how many cars they can roll off their production line, and how quickly they can add extra digits to their earnings report to expand production capability.

However, the longer the auto industry takes to step up and provide a direct competitor to Tesla, the more Tesla manages to survive and the more likely that a midrange car is released, which could signal the tipping point that investment firms will finally step up and say it's time to expand production. 

Right now oil has dropped to crazy low prices, so it makes fresh investing money even more rare for Tesla. What I would be watching for is how Tesla, the business entity, responds to this monstrous lull in oil prices which might last a month or a decade. How does the Tesla brand, an exclusive producer of electric vehicles, survive when the alternative just became much cheaper and sexier to investors. 

If the production numbers don't lie, and it stays on a pretty decent run despite the tsunami it is fighting against, then you are looking at a true anomaly in the market. A diamond in the rough with ridiculous brand advantage. 

But if it doesn't work out that way, you just lost a lot of money waiting for the world to think like you, and you didn't even cushion yourself by buying the company when it was trading close to its book value. There is an intimidating gap between the reproducible worth of Tesla's physical assets and how much the market is valuing it at. The only thing that can sustain that gap is a verifiable crazy brand franchise value, which has yet to materialize for me. 

So I would say wait a few more pitches, and swing when the right one comes by. Remember, a lost opportunity costs you nothing, but swinging at a bad pitch is even worse."
2015-02-13 20:07:47,"Since you were curious, here is Vanguard's Total Market Fund Return from both 2007 to present and 2009 to present.

[2007-present](http://imgur.com/8K2ApoR)  The final value of $10,000 was $17,286.44
[2009-present](http://imgur.com/N9YSv6I)  The final value of $10,000 was $28,896.90.

These are both based off of monthly returns.  Though none of this should be surprising.  If you started investing right in 2007 you got in right before the peak of the market.  During the recession stocks were absolutely crushed.  Even bonds took a beating during this time period.  For the entirety of 2009 stocks and bonds had a correlation of roughly 30%.   Diversification was at this point essentially problematic.  I hardly believe that a recession as terrible as this will be seen again (or at least I hope not)."

2015-02-13 14:37:07,"I'm sorry this topic has so many negative comments.  I'd hoped to see suggestions for improvements such as how to have Costco add iPhones and MacBook Pros to their selection.

From the stock market point of view, the issue of crowds and long checkout lines probably don't matter.  Costco can raise prices so fewer people shop there.  Higher prices can increase revenue so Costco can hire more workers to keep more checkout lanes open.  But hire prices would bring more customer complaints about high prices.  Either way the market probably doesn't care.  With so many people shopping there, it sounds like good news for COST stock holders.

There are plenty of mobile devs killing it like Toys For Bob, Supercell or Mahcine Zone but they are just drops in a bucket to Activision Blizzard or SFTBY.

Earnings per company in this sector have a near zero correlation with the earnings of the sector as a whole. It's not like in oil where if 1 company does well, it's very likely that the others are doing so as well (maybe oil isn't a great example but you get what I mean).

2016-03-01 11:22:12,"I've been under the assumption that the question was ""Can you determine the probability for the price of a given stock at a particular point in time?"" I don't disagree with a thing you said, however I'll argue that my points still stand. What is the probability that LUV will be $XX.XX 6 months from now? The stock market and economics are examples of a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system) and that is where calculating the probability involves ""accounting for"".

2016-03-01 10:41:38,"Every theory is bearish huh, lol.  Bad sign.  00 and 08 were also at peaks in commodities and many other markets.  Not the same."
2016-03-01 10:26:01,"&gt; Consider accounting for the probability of the Flash Crash, or the 08' crash, or oil, etc. events like those need to be accounted for when calculating probability.

Going to jump in here.  The topic at hand is (summed up) ""Does price momentum exist?""  I think the answer to that is definitively ""yes.""  There's plenty of research out there that discusses this - Cliff Asness is a great source (no doubt you're familiar with him).

On to something more specific:  this idea that you have to account for ""the Flash Crash,"" or ""the '08 Crash,"" etc.  

First off, if you're looking at historical prices, you've accounted for these things.  They're prices, just like other prices.  No reason to highlight them specifically, unless you're attempting to isolate outliers.

Second, these things lend credence to the idea of price momentum - they don't take away.  The Flash Crash came at the end of what you might call 6 days of downward trending prices.  The '08 ""crash"" was less of a crash and more of a slow motion tragedy that - as it is with a lot of tragedies - had an end that was slightly more spectacular than the beginning or middle.  The '08 decline didn't come out of nowhere - markets had been deteriorating for months.  

Oil - the price movement since the summer of '14 is a classic example of price momentum.  Nothing to ""account for"" here along what you've mentioned.

Etc., etc."

2016-03-01 07:52:49,"The problem is that all trading decisions depend on feedback, they don't exist independently.  If any reliable tendency existed, it would self-correct - i.e., if there were some independent, measurable tendency to go up solely based on moving some amount down, it would be noticed, and sellers would hold off and buyers would intensify, leading to overshoot and sellers in turn trying to outdo each other in anticipating the run-up, and so on, until it cancelled out."

2016-03-01 06:56:45,"Search for information on investopedia. I'd say it is the most friendly place to look for basic information about the financial markets. You should look for stocks definitions. Then move on to how stock markets works. And it kind of depends on what you're looking for, because it is easy as search &amp; demand. That is how it works. Now, what defines search and demand is ""the science"" of it.

A good addition to your knowledge of the financial markets is to be able to distinguish investors. The common distinction is between hedger, arbitrageur and speculator. The names are relatively self-explanatory but you should still read about it, just to be sure you completely understand how the basics work. 

There are a lot of other contents on investopedia you can read, of course. Specially in the product types, which you will have loads of information to catch up, unless you keep focus on equity products.

So they are lagging the overall market (which is declining because of corp. debt) this time. Transports used to decline first because people bought less and travelled less as a first sign of bad things to come, and the rest would fall with it. The only real unemployment we do have now is isolated to the oil, E&amp;P and engineering procurement and construction related to oil, and these are traditionally people with expendable cash, so with the rest of America still working pretty much the same and the weekly unemployment numbers and wages look decent still, the ttraditional relationship of DJT being the leading indicator of a decline isn't such a strong correlation .

2016-02-27 04:27:14,"IMO there are really no good books that will teach you technical analysis - which is mostly what will be used for short term trading - in a practical sense that you can use in modern markets. Any books written on technical analysis I've ever read tend to be about traditional patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, double top, double bottom, etc but those are patterns that EVERYONE knows and thus they tend to actually do the opposite of what you expect or at best be unpredictable since the herd follows them. To beat the market you need to develop your own system of patterns and ideas which can really only be learned through experience, or learning it from someone who already has the experience. 

As far as fundamentals, sure they are an aspect of short term trading, but fundamentals will usually only go as far as telling you when a move in a stock is an overreaction and when it's not. Unfortunately, for short term trades, it's not like you can look at an earnings release and say ""well this stock went up 40% but I think it is only worth a 20% gain"" since the market can remain irrational for long periods of time (case in point KBIO went from $.40 to $45 in a bout a week even though it was bankrupt, just based on speculation that Martin Shkreli was going to ""rescue"" it). Anyway the point is the reason that you're finding the fundamentals stuff geared more toward long term investing is that fundamental ""corrections"" tend to take multiple months (sometimes years) to happen. Stocks can stay over/undervalued for years so fundamentals really have no place in short term trading other than to give your technical case a bit more credibility. 

Anyway, that's my take. I've read a lot of books about this and I can confidently say the only thing that ever taught me anything was learning from a professional (I paid someone to teach me everything he knew) and experiencing losing money over the years to learn what not to do. 

I know that's probably not the answer you want to hear but it's the truth IMHO. Everything that I learned up to the point I paid someone to teach me I pretty much just learned through experience, trial and error, and lots and lots and lots of googling. I could have sped up the process a lot if I found my mentor sooner, lol "

2017-03-15 22:35:53,"When the announcement occurs, share price will adjust upwards to be slightly lower than the purchase price. As the deal reaches closer to the planned acquisition date and becomes more and more likely to actually close, the price will settle near the purchase price. Once the deal actually closes, your shares will either automatically be sold in a cash deal or be converted to the buyers shares in a stock deal (this is assuming you hadn't sold earlier). "

2017-03-15 22:19:37,"If the SPX fails to close down -1% for the next 6 trading days that will tie the longest -1% less streak since 1985 and if it fails to do it a day after that, that would be the longest streak since the 1960s! The all-time longest recorded non -1% closing days in a row for the SPX was 184 trading days back in 1963...we're still a way's away from reaching that milestone.

However needles to say we are quite ovedue for a nice washout one of these days. The question is when will it come, and what will be the catalyst that does it?

As you can see from the chart above, after a 100+ day streak w/o a -1% close on the SPX has historically been short-term bearish for the markets, however longer term bullish.

Ever since the U.S. presidential election this market has been on a rampage to the upside. Albiet, it has taken a bit of a pause as of late, until today however when it would appear as if we're right back into rally mode again.

It has been an impressive run &amp; streak. But, with all things this will end at some point. When that day comes is obviously anyone's guess. But, for now this market seems perfectly fine finding acceptance at these higher levels."

2017-03-15 20:49:35,"Buyouts/acquisitions almost always happen at a price premium to market. Usually the buyer can justify this premium because of synergies obtained through the acquisition. Imagine company X is worth $100 and company Y is worth $30. Company X can acquire Company Y and due to synergies (cross-sell opportunities, etc. values the whole company at $150 if they acquire company Y. Then they would comfortably offer Company Y $35 (more than market) to acquire the shares. Once the acquisition is done and assuming that the business strategy was accurate, Company X still comes out ahead and has created value even though they paid more than the market value of Company Y at the time of purchase. :)"

2017-03-15 11:25:03,"generally the buyers stock sees a dip, as the investors are looking at the money/stock the (buyer) is paying for the acquisition, and an acquisition =/= guaranteed profit.

The company that is being purchased will generally see a rise in share price, as they are generally offered a premium over their current share price to entice investors and account for the beneficial synergies they bring to the table.

You usually want to be on the bought side.

This does not always hold true, for instance, if the acquisition is considered to be accretive, and immediately adds to shareholder value, the value of both companies stocks can rise. For example, $TCX just acquired a company called ENOM recently, (domain registrars). This acquisition is one that immediately begins paying back to the company in terms of value. They increased their domain registration customer base to become the second largest registrar in the world. Their stock price saw a nice little increase. "

2017-03-15 02:33:14,"The efficient market hypothesis has various degrees and the question really is to what degree the market is efficient. Perfectly efficient markets can't exist (all information reflected -&gt; stockpicking doesn't matter -&gt; no one bothers to gather any information so how could it all be reflected?). There isn't a consensus since all tests require a pricing model and we don't know how to correctly price stocks (or if it's even possible).

So I think the main thing here is that people are using returns only, while they should be using risk adjusted returns, and even that only works if we have the correct pricing model (which we don't) and the market as a whole has a strictly mean-variance utility function (which it doesn't). 

TLDR: The market might be efficient to some degree because we have no fucking idea how a stock should be priced"

2017-03-14 23:52:25,"Hey Stock Jock-e I originally wasn't going to click on this thread since it was about Go Pro. I wasn't sure if this was an argument to buy Go Pro but now I can see its not. But just to add to it I can say that Go Pro has no future. Fit Bit on the other hand is a screaming buy in my opinion especially at this $5 level. I bought a huge huge portion of my position at 5.80 just the other day.

btw 1 Day hospitals doctors and insurance companies will require fitbits on all patients and employees for health coverage purposes and incentives. This to me is a future no brainer given the consumer side of it is great too. Right now investors are grouping Fit and Gopro into 1 category. So basically Fit Bit is taking a hit because of the sour narrative of Go Pro. Soon it will be Fit Bit that lifts or shines a new light on the wearabale tech space and the narrative will be that Fit Bit is the leader and can Go Pro catch up. Investing is a game of see sawing. NArrative, Relative, and Time Analysis matter. I preach this over and over again. Coincidentally your timing of asking the question lines up with the right timing of a Fit Bit bottom in my opinion. Whether it trades down another dollar or so from this 5.50 mark is a complete guess. Point is, now is the time to buy a little bit everyday for a nice dollar cost average going forward."

Net debt  
Revenue growth y/y over the last years  
Gross margin  
Operating margin  
Net margin  
P/E  
Operating expense y/y over the last years    

One important note is that stock price historically is completely irrelevant."

2018-04-01 06:19:58,"Everyone uses different metrics to determine if a company has value to invest in or is too expensive. Unfortunately, there is no holy grail metric or metrics to combine that make picking stocks easy. You will still be at the whim of the market and a lot of times there isn't any logic behind a stocks movement. 

A stock is only worth it's perceived value that another investor is willing to pay for it. If the majority of people think Apple will be worth more from being successful then the stock is going to go up. If people think the company is not innovative and is stagnant with nothing new(2012-2013) then the stock goes down. Even though they made 37 billion in profit then, more than any company in the world the stock still lost like 40%.

Of course they have to pay the artists/musicians as well but my guess is they’ll do just fine considering Apple Music is their only real competition.

With the volatility we’ve been seeing recently, easing in over the next few weeks might get you a better average cost than just dumping in there on Monday, we’re in for a bumpy road over the next few months and if you’re a long-term holder, putting in 10-20% on every big down day will get you a good average cost. They say don’t time the market, but the market is going to have a lot more big downs that big ups. It’s better if you can make those down days buying opportunities instead of days to grit your teeth and hold. But back to your original question, absolutely yes. Maybe diversify into small caps and international, but you don’t need multiple etfs tracking the sp500."

2018-03-31 20:25:04,"This is how I see it:

Stock market reaction would be a sell off. Reason being that stock prices are driven by a companies performance in making profit and how it's future looks in making money too. If the minimum wage was increased to $15 an hour, that would mean every business would be spending more money and profiting less. From that standpoint the market would perceive declining EPS from quarterly earnings as a negative putting downward pressure on stocks.

Small businesses probably cannot afford an increase to $15, especially in parts of the country where the cost of living is low. This would be a bigger increase than for companies in New York or California for example.

This increase might not be something small businesses can afford and either go out of business and/or lay off employee's to stay in business. Regardless the unintended consequence of raising the minimum wage to $15 across the country is unemployment goes up and then the Federal government is spending more money on food stamps and unemployment checks,they will be receiving less revenue's from taxes as will local governments, the economy will slow down and this will also add to the downward pressure on the stock market. A little of snowball affect.

Conclusion: Initially stock market drops from news. Then as time goes on, lack of performance from companies will keep stock market performance down."

AAPL trades in a very predictable pattern with short term FUD before earnings to drive the price down.

Last cycle ended this time last year and we've seen an incredible gain since. 

Remember that this company is not just the iPhone. That being said, Apple showed the largest growth in US phone sales in quarter 4 ever. I expect a big quarter and tepid short term guidance. Quarter guidance this time of year is always meh, and meh means billions in profit.

2018-01-31 16:09:27,"Hey, I might enjoy helping you through some of your questions if you can PM them to me. Might deepen my understanding as well.  

ETF stands for Exchange Traded Funds, which basically means a ""basket"" of multiple stocks traded together. ETFs allow you to buy and sell larger groupings or types of stocks more easily. For example banking stocks. You might point out that you could simulate an ETF by buying 1 share from each stock in a group, but that would be very expensive, and you would have extra exposure to the most expensive stocks since more of your money is tied up in them. An ETF can even out the share prices by holding different percentages according to the price of the stock, and they can be cheaper by offering you an arbitrary share of the ETF, which allows you to ""own"" (through the ETF) less than one share of each company.

Prior to ETFs, if you thought software was going to do well, you had to find the best software company and hope the market trends helped them specifically. With an ETF you can buy a whole group of software companies in general. This protects you from exposure to any individual company, saves on research work identifying who is in the group, and allows for cheaper per-share prices.

Be careful thinking ""I want to invest heavily in ETFs"" because you need to remember that is equivalent to ""I want to invest heavily in stocks.""  That may be fine for a 35 yr old who wants profit (seems ok to me) but don't let the ETF term confuse you. You're buying stocks. Sliced up thinly, but still stocks.

To check your understanding, compare ETFs to the similar (but slightly different) Mutual Funds.

Edit: you might look into dividends as a possible counter-proposal to ETFs."

Oil was very predictable in the height of our last recession. What the last two big bear markets taught me is after the dump, trading is slow. Retail investors stop, they are licking wounds, scared. So I found jumping into more professionally traded commodities, ETN, and ETF's is where you could still get volatility which brings profits and losses.

I rigorously track my performance against SPY, short- and long-term.

2019-04-16 13:29:22,I can provide you a screenshot of the questions that were asked by interested people who watched my videos here!
2019-04-16 13:19:21,"It is extremely unlikely that cryptocurrencies will become mainstream for trade. What makes them unique is also what makes them a bad choice for common use.

They are a token with provable supply and provable ownership. In a world where central banks have grown accustomed to using QE and low interest rates to expand the money supply, cryptocurrencies can't be inflated at the whim of central banks. But it also means their buying power is unstable they can't be stabilized by central banks.

They are completely trustless. This means that every node in the network has to agree on each transaction, which results in scaling problems that traditional banking networks handle easily. It also means your bank can't help you if you lose your private key and your credit card issuer can't help you if the store you bought from is a fraud. The most common consensus algorithms are also extremely energy intensive and wasteful.

They can be made untraceable. This inevitably results in them being connected with ransom, terrorism, drug sales, and tax fraud. As a result, governments are inclined to ban their usage, and many already have.

Every attempt you make to ""solve"" these problems (lightning network, custodial wallets) makes cryptocurrencies look one step closer to fiat money controlled by banks, except with no price stabilization. So, cryptocurrencies are probably useful for some specific cases. But you tell me, will they ever replace fiat as the de facto medium of trade?"

Plenty of us have read it, simple fact is, it’s not simple for the average person to use. It much easier to pull a $50 out of my pocket and spend it rather than to find someone who will accept a satoshi."

2019-04-16 12:38:02,"Crypto, more specifically blockchain for financial purposes, is a fantastic piece of financial tech.

That being said- not in the way most people over at r/cryptocurrency hope it will be. 

The idea that “oh look! I just bought a bagel with cream cheese with my litecoin!” Is just fucking stupid considering the long list of processes behind getting to that point. 

It just doesn’t make sense to replace current currency with a coin and I don’t think there will ever be a mass switch over to a coin which replaces standard currency. 

However, there could be a mass adoption of blockchain with a coin being a medium. The difference here... we just wouldn’t know it happened unless for a press release. 

Transaction times would simply decrease and become more secure. It would help open doors for other financial tech build around blockchain. And so on. It’s already something that’s going on behind the scenes to help with logistics bottlenecks. 

All that being said, it isn’t work investing in a coin with the belief that one day you’ll be reliant on a shit coin for purchases."

This thing is simply being driven by headlines and emotions right now...period! There is not one single shred of reliable economic data that can begin to justify a market rally of the magnitude we have seen last month.

Just,as,we,saw a substantially drop in March followed by a tremendous rally in April, I would not be at all surprised to see more highly volatile price,action in the months to come.

What’s the long-term investor to do? Market timing is a fool’s errand...we simply have no way to know what,is coming next. Just,stick to your investing plan...now more so than ever. Perhaps raise cash allocation a bit to allow a bit more capital to invest of a particularly good opportunity presents itself.

I am currently 70% stocks, 20% bonds and 10% cash. I am considering reducing stock exposure to 60% and raising bonds to 25% and cash to 15%, but I am still assesssing how that,will impact my total returns.

2020-05-01 01:34:45,"Big tech companies are still way overvalued in traditional measurements of PE ratio. I mean most of them range around 30+ PE and a healthy PE should be around 12-15 for a mature company, so I'd agree with OP. Also we are seeing the biggest recession and rapid fall of the global economy in a lifetime for most people and still market is looking strong. I'd say the market is completely irrational since a few years back and hype/irrational anticipation seems to be a major factor for stock growth in many cases, look at Tesla, Netflix, Beyond meat etc, the list is very long.. I'm not complaining though, just can't predict based on fundamentals anymore in modern sectors like tech, green energy etc. 

Question is, why is the market still so strong? Too much dollars in circulation perhaps? Internet and accessibility to the stock market in combination with traders who can't make proper valuations? I usually trade of fundamentals, mainly looking at PE or potential and YtY revenue growth but I'm guilty of jumping on the hype trains even if I know there's no way in hell Tesla or Beyond Meat is gonna catch up with their valuations."

There is no 'strategy' that guarantees returns. If there was one everyone would be following it. For stock market, the easiest way is to keep investing some of your savings into market (called dollar cost averaging). Pick stable 5-10 stocks that pay dividends with a small percentage in meme stocks like Tesla. A diversified ETF can make this easier. Your accounts will go green and red but after a couple of years there is a huge chance it will be green."

Not granite or potlights etc. But nice clean finishes that shoot the rent market value all the way up. That alone screens most bad tenants. Also i only do single family homes. Sure multiplexes cashflow better, but if find the tenant profile of higher quality with single family homes. When they mow the lawn, pay the utilities they seem to make it their own.

2020-05-01 00:47:30,100% Bullish
2020-05-01 00:45:12,"I don't know about comparison. I like real estate. There are a few things to know, there are additional costs from time, effort, management , upkeep , utilities. There are benefits like depreciation deductions and other tax breaks. There are also general market risks. That being said it's great income if you handle it well. The refinance scenario you describe seems unlikely or at least more difficult and there is a waiting period on refinance without showing your actual cost of improvements. I tend to think of real estate as very long term. My stock plays are much shorter term."
2020-05-01 00:41:34,"I'm also 80%+ invested in real estate vs 20% in equities. 

My take on it is the following:

\- Real estate is a much longer game than equities.

\- What little I've gained in stocks pales in comparison to the gains I've made in real estate (a 6x increase in worth over 10 years). And this is not being particularly aggressive with real estate either, it's mostly using common sense, knowing the market, and looking for deals when they come. My stock portfolio has come nowhere close to that. What is the S&amp;P, maybe 2x over 10 years, 2.5x with dividends? Pathetic.

\- Like stocks, real estate is only great if you can find deals. If you can't find deals, it's more of a liability than an asset. For the past 2 years, deals have been few and far between, especially in my area (Salt Lake City). Lately, I'm lucky if I see one potential deal every 6 months, and that deal more than often falls through. 

\- With real estate, you're playing with someone else's money. Sure, you can buy properties cash if you have it, but it's much more effective to mortgage them and leverage. 

\- It's difficult to panic-sell real estate, even if you try.  That solves my biggest problem as an equities investor :)

\- The tax benefits of real estate far surpass anything in equities. 

\- I've stuck to A and B neighborhoods, not because the cap rates are better but because I have a day job and it's much less stressful. That seedy 4-plex with a cap rate of 10% looks great until you need to do major repairs, or (heaven forbid) liquidate it when a brand new apartment complex opens across the street with competitive rent. 

\- I could go back in time and buy AMD when it was $2 a share, or Amazon at $50/share, that wouldn't be too shabby. But ditto bitcoin. History tends to remember stock winners and forget the losers. I'm not down on stocks, but I feel much, much more confident in my ability to pick real estate winners than equities winners. 

TL;DR: I'm with you. So far I've been very unimpressed with stocks compared to real estate."
2020-05-01 00:40:33,"Edge computing will increase the need for cloud computing. They work in tandem.

Also, the vehicle doesn’t send data to the cloud to make every decision. Most of it is ran off of preinstalled software. The same way you  don’t have to play a video game from the cloud, you can download it or by physical media. The software uses the cloud to download patches, updates, and additional features. The only way you could do this without the cloud would be to physically run an install on each vehicle. 

Edge computing along with sensors and machine learning will drive the real time “awareness” environment but you still need somewhere to store and process mass data. Even if you argue each individual car will process it’s own data it still needs to send it to “the cloud” to be stored, analyzed, and compared to other vehicles.

2020-05-01 00:40:32,"Hmm all that leverage is definitely great strategy. Here is an equivalent strategy. What you can do get a margin account. I think if you put in $50K into a brokerage you will be able to get like a million dollars in leverage atleast if not more. Since you like to 'invest' in 'safe' assets like Real Estate, you might want to look at safe instruments like bonds, REITs etc. Put that million dollars in and reap in benefits through dividends for life."
2020-05-01 00:37:50,"How much money have you made trading that data? Don't answer that out loud. I am not asking you to tell me. I just want to know if you have actually done regression analysis on your trades.

I wrote the model that made this trade:

https://twitter.com/GravityAnalyti1/status/1238107358276071425

You wrote a data scraper. I've already analyzed that data. As have numerous other people.  And, I already know it has no value. At least not unless it is seasonal adjusted.  Even then, it has no value to retail traders because you can't gain any advantage using it. 

But, if you want to share proof you have developed a trading model based on that data that beats the S&amp;P. I'd love to be proven wrong. I think it's great when retail wins. 

This provides value.

I wrote the some of the models behind that as well. And, it's free as long as we decide to leave it up. It is an event-based classifier. Have fun. I can turn on insider events but right now they are off, as they have no value.

Big surprise the obvious conclusion is the correct conclusion (tech = less physical shit to be affected by COVID). This isn’t rocket science. Also interest rates to 0 and pumping in trillions of dollars is definitely going to inflate all assets, in particular stocks. 

The same people who were complaining about a bear market right around the corner for the last 10 years since the Great Recession will now be saying the same thing until this bull run ends in 2030 (exaggerating, but not entirely kidding)."

2021-05-16 13:42:45,"What are your goals? Are you trying to trade or invest?

If you want to trade then you’ll need to learn about technical trends and signals. You should also have a platform like ThinkOrSwim to draw up charts and look at indicators.

If you want to invest, then you’ll want to learn about what are called “fundamentals”. You should essentially be able to read a company’s financial statements and then use them to come up with a valuation and price estimate for what you think the company will be worth in the future if trends continue. If you do your homework and anlysis thoroughly then you won’t be bothered by short term price dips since you’ll be confident that the company will perform well in the long term.

Traders typically trade in the short term and try to capitalize on swings in a stock’s price whereas investors truly want to own a piece of the company and have a strong conviction that it will perform well in the long term."

To my understanding the reason to do this is because as they're ITM those shares count as shares to the contract holder even if they're unexercised. 

So if you owe someone a hundred shares to balance a book you can buy 1 ITM instead without actually buying the shares. 

So the question becomes who needs to be able to say they have that many shares when they don't and why. It would be super shady if the contract seller further hasn't hedged for them either.

2022-05-31 22:33:11,"Gona warn you here, it’s much smarter to invest into a broad market index and secure a guaranteed 10% P.A return. You’re listing reasons like “I have a super long time frame” which is ironically the perfect reason for investing in the BROAD market and keep in mind Tesla already has nearly a $1T market cap and for comparison Apple is $2.3T. 

Tesla has a VERY high P/E ratio and that’s the cost of such a high growth company in a field where they’re leagues ahead of competition. But it’s inevitable the competition will catch up and if Tesla’s growth slows there’s no telling where the stock price will end up.

If you’re okay to loose a lot of this money then sure, keep it in Tesla but I don’t think it’s smart to put anymore in, you should gear all future investments into something safe and guaranteed that can take advantage of your time frame."

2022-05-31 21:56:56,"The fact that you are asking this question is proof that you should not be putting all your hopes into a single stock no matter what it is. The only way you could be justified in doing that is if you knew for certain that the stock would provide a return higher than that of the S&amp;P. You don't know that.

There's a chance that Tesla could quadruple a couple more times, but there's also a decent chance that in 2050 it could be half of what it's worth right now. It could go to 0. The valuation is such that it looks like the next couple of decades of growth are already priced in, and for what it's worth, my personal opinion is that it's going to be many years before it sees $1000 again, if ever. 

Everyone thinks they're fine with a stock going to 0, but it's only when the tide goes out that they find out what their risk tolerance really is. Not putting all your money in a single stock is a lesson that has been learned by market participants over and over and over again. If you insist on learning this lesson for yourself, well..."

rather than just buying 10 puts to cover the 1000 shares of common stock, buy to open 11 puts way OTM maybe at 90 by example. this way IF they tank huge , not only are you protected, but you make a tiny bit extra."
2013-07-21 01:27:57,"Thanks. It's true that it's just one indicator, and I guess I was a bit over-excited at having spotted the pattern at all. It's hard to guess what Goldman **really** thinks or wants (AAPL $1000 anyone?) so for now I'm going to keep it on my watchlist as we move closer to earnings."
2013-07-21 01:24:27,"&gt; some stocks work nicely with basic TA, some stocks simply ignore most basic TA and TSLA is a prime example of this.

This seems like a pretty important point. I'm wary of holding a long term position with TSLA, but if the pattern holds on its way to earnings and anything else funky shows up, I might throw some play money at deep OTM puts. Thanks for your thoughts.

Clarification edit: I don't hold any position with TSLA."
2013-07-21 00:38:51,"In my opinion the artificial inflation is coming at the worst time, economy is just starting to pick up.

You can put pressure on people's wallet when money is ""free"". However, I don't believe the economy has reached that point yet. In order for inflation to work, that money the Feds pumped into the market need a larger value to trickle down to the people. 

In my opinion the best thing the Feds can do once we start stagflation is lower reserve rates, and increase interest rates at the same time. "

Right now, TSLA is being heavily used by the professional daytrade/short term (few days) crowd. TSLA seemed pinned to 120 for expiry on friday and that's right where it closed.

TSLA earnings are Aug 7; and it's a who the hell knows...

I have a tiny tiny amount from its IPO ages ago, and a few weeks ago on the run to 100; bought some protective deep OTM puts.

Have traded it a few times last week on that lovely down move from 120 and up from 110.

Those moves made some sense, the large down and large up; but here, at 120 : no idea, let the tape itself tell you , not MACD or other TA.

If anyone is considering longing some or shorting some common stock for a longer term hold, be smart and hedge the other way with OTM options, TSLA options are surprisingly not that expensive (but will go up into their Aug 7 earnings)"

I'm a long term investor so I try not to get too aggressive with my moves.  (Except with maybe a few stocks to play).  I tend to keep lower risk stocks (JNJ, GLD, IBM, DIS), dividend reinvesting appeals to me.  I'm not too worried about the day to day but the long road ahead.

Quality and preferences aside, that is what people pay for. Especially in foreign markets. Jobs was against a cheaper version for the very reason. Sure there will be people that want to buy a cheaper Bentley, but the real money, the consumer loyalty, comes from the premium customers. Women understand this concept very well with their purses."

The way I look at it, Apple $495B company, they're not going to grow like they did in the past.  They will grow, but not as fast.  If you can afford to do so, buy more in small chunks.  if you have 10k to spend.  buy 3k worth now, 3k if it falls again.  keep doing this if you believe the fundamentals are strong.


Apple is returning money to the shareholders via both buybacks and dividends.  With the price so low, I wouldn't doubt if the board gave in to Ichan's plans and bought even more back.  For long term investors, this is the best thing that can happen.  "

2014-01-27 19:10:35,"Think of it this way, you only lose money if you sell when you're down. Just wait it out until you at least break even after commission fees, then sell your shares if you think you can't handle it.

------

&gt; I bought ANIK because...i believe its best selling product will continue to do well, or even better.

i have edited your last to include the general assumption that you don't know how to do valuations. it's ok, this is your first shot, so let's stick with the ""gut instinct"" part of your decisions, since that's probably the best thing you've got going. Let us not ascribe to genius, that which you don't seem to understand.

Looking at ONLY these 3 statements, has anything changed about those companies/sectors? Have any of your original assumptions be proven false? If yes, then you should sell, because your original investing premise is gone. If no, then hold.

2014-01-27 15:31:58,that is correct. many brokers won't even deal with these companies. they're SUPER sketchy.
2014-01-27 15:03:36,Most brokers will let you trade OTC stocks the same way you would any other stock. Some will charge a higher commission though.  The difference is that OTC stocks don't have to follow the same regulations as stocks listed on NYSE or NASDAQ.  Also liquidity tends to be significantly lower making it hard to sell in time in the event of a crash.  This means a pump and dump can ensure you lose all your money very quickly and you may not be able to tell you're in one until it's too late.
2014-01-27 14:54:59,"Thanks guys that's what I gather too.

And from my understanding the OTC type penny stocks are unlisted and can't even be traded on the normal markets like NYSE etc. Someone would have to put the effort into finding a broker that can deal with them on the OTCBB and get on board that way. Am I correct?"

2014-01-27 13:13:00,"Yeah, there are plenty stocks that trade under $5 on the big exchanges that are no where near as sketchy as the shit you see in OTC.

2014-01-27 11:08:47,"Its more to do with the market cap.

If AAPL has $500B in market cap, regardless what the shares trade it, you are not going to call a multi-billion market cap company a penny stock if the shares are below $5.

This is just my definition, I had a long and drawn out debate about this before."
2014-01-27 11:00:28,I consider everything traded on the OTC markets a penny stock.  Stocks under $5 traded on the major exchanges are mostly micro-cap which is more volitile than the blue-chip stocks but the OTC stuff is on a whole different level.
2014-01-27 10:04:06,"Potentially silly question here: somebody once mentioned that my stocks are down because of general selling in the markets (Dow and S&amp;P 500 were down too).

I bought a biotechnology ETF, not much valuation to do there, because I've read about the benefits of ETFs and investing broadly. Also, I feel biotech will grow as a sector because there is always demand for better drugs and healthcare. I bought ANIK because it's attaining great earnings growth, financials look great (revenue has increased while costs have decreased, good cash flow) and I've read its reports and i believe its best selling product will continue to do well, or even better. Also, it's undervalued compared to the industry. "

2014-01-27 02:10:34,"If you'd sold your stocks as the prices started to plunge AND kept buying in with your paychecks and the amount from the sale of stocks wouldn't your average cost be even lower? I agree with buying in as prices drop, but why not sell my preexisting holdings?"

I didn't have a lot of money then (or now) but what I could afford I used to buy as much stock as I could as prices continued to sink. I bought into some index funds and individual stocks. I have done very well on some of them as a result of keeping a level head and looking for value.

2012-07-01 04:43:21,"I'm bullish atm. Well, I always am long-term bull on silver until structural change in monetary policy and gov't budget happens. But I'm even bullish in the medium term atm.

Looking at the actual spot silver price it hasn't passed, but kissed the support which it also kissed in January 2012, September 2011, January 2011, and even November 2010 twice. That's a strong support! This is also really the first week of positive gains since the end of February. And if it were to go up to $35 it would create a nice inverse head and shoulders. And if it were to go up to $40 and retrace back down it would create a huge inverse head and shoulders.

SINGAPORE, June 29 | Thu Jun 28, 2012 11:07pm EDT

(Reuters) - The euro surged on Friday after European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said the euro zone reaffirms its commitment to use its bailout funds flexibly and efficiently to stabilise markets.


BRUSSELS--Euro zone leaders agreed Friday to a series of long-debated measures they hope will calm market pressure on Spain and Italy, including pledging to eventually allow direct recapitalization of euro-zone banks and opening access to the region's rescue funds to countries not in bailout programs.
After a summit meeting that dragged into the early morning hours Friday, the leaders also agreed that the region's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will not have senior creditor status when it takes over the loans granted to Spain for its ailing banks. A senior European official said Spain will eventually be able to take the loans off its sovereign debt balance sheet.
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said euro-zone banks will be able to directly access the region's permanent bailout mechanism once a single bank supervisor is established. He said the European Commission will soon make a proposal on this plan.
The decisions were immediately welcomed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who, along with Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, drove a hard bargain during the talks to secure immediate steps to help ease soaring borrowing costs in their countries.
Mr. Monti said the steps taken were very positive for the euro zone and should help to stabilize the region's economy.
Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, told reporters that ""considering the difficulty of the moment and of the discussions, we have managed to send markets a message that - I hope - will convince them.""
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said euro-zone leaders took good short-term decisions and that further work would be needed on long-term solutions.

2012-12-21 00:27:33,"Herbalife, HLF"
2012-12-20 22:50:32,"HLF

In an interview with Bloomberg TV this afternoon, Mr Ackman said his fund has over $1 billion riding on this bet, and is short over 20 million Herbalife shares as part of the trade. According to Factset, there is currently about 20.7 million Herbalife shares on loan for short trades, meaning that Mr Ackman’s fund doesn’t just have the largest short position in the company — it pretty much IS the short position.

And as Markit told Corporate Intelligence earlier today, about two thirds of all the Herbalife shares available to be borrowed are already out on loan (nearly all of them, it seems, to Mr Ackman).

That means those who want to tag along behind Mr Ackman and get in on the Herbalife shorting action will find it increasingly difficult, and expensive, to do from now on. You could try buying some put options, but those will likely get more expensive as well, if the market keeps turning against the company."

2014-08-07 13:08:39,"It's very difficult to say. I don't think that SCTY has had that amazing of a quarter - there has been very little news or hype about how much they've actually installed. Considering they missed on Q1 estimates, chances are they'll miss again, especially with the Silevo acquisition driving down their EPS. 

They could say some interesting things about what their future goals are for Silevo, but it's too early for something earth shattering (new panel technology), and after that 17% jump post-acquisition anything they could deliver on that end may have already been priced into the stock.

I'd play it conservatively on this one - it's better to lose less/make a smaller profit than to risk it and have your money stuck in there for months on end. If you truly got in when the stock was $80+, and you have a lot invested, might as well just wait. It'll definitely be up there eventually.

2014-08-06 19:13:35,"The channel -- the shaded part that looks like prices bouncing between two parallel lines (shaded and labeled ""Distribution"" on the chart)-- is proceeding towards the point where the last upward move (between Sep. and Nov.) met with resistance and stopped going up (right before the channel begins).  Basically, resistance is anywhere where prices are shooting up and then hit a brick wall.  That brick wall is resistance.  (The opposite is support, the point where prices are plummeting but hit a floor and have a hard time going any further).

It's common knowledge that once a stock breaks through a resistance level (as what happened here when the channel started by spiking up through that resistance level at around $25.84), that level becomes a new support.  Because previously broken resistance levels have a knack for becoming future support levels, it was a dangerous move to *assume* that the channel was going to keep going like that.  Because on the very right of OP's graph, the channel runs into that $25.84 possible-support line, and it's good form to at least wait and see if it bounces off of it (which it did, in a very violent and powerful way).

-edit-

The channel actually passed through that $25.84 support a few times on its way down, but it never 'clears it by enough'.  Support and resistance levels are sort of ""soft boundaries"".  So in this case, the support was somewhere around 25.53-25.84, and the channel never really pushed down through it with any real power.

2014-08-06 17:08:20,I agree with this. Compare SCTY and TSLA together. Their growth lines are pretty much the same. If one goes up so does the other. No doubt in my mind it goes above the highest high. All a matter of if you're willing to wait

If you really have a lot of doubt, sell part of your position, to the point where you can sleep at night and not worry about it too much.
"
2014-08-06 15:16:55,"I'm certainly not an expert, but I think much of the stock's growth is due to an Elon Musk/Tesla halo effect rather than solid fundamentals. It's over-valued. But it's a momentum stock that will swing wildly in both directions. Be careful trying to guess earnings. My advice would be to create a price hypothesis. If/when it hits that price, sell your shares or reevaluate your hypothesis. How much are you down at this point?

FWIW, my Tesla hypothesis is $300. I don't own any SCTY, but have a couple of friends who swear by its growth potential."

2014-08-06 12:56:09,"Sorry I got the dollar amount off by three.  And you're right about the literal meaning of the plan; but it's still idiotic.  It's asking people to pay extra so that their facebook data won't be counted toward their data limit, and it's assuming that the individuals using a whole lot of fb will understand that they won't be paying for facebook itself.  As well, the margin of savings between the 12 dollars and an extra GB of data is quite thin.  The people looking to save more than a few dollars a month are just going to either change the permissions on their phone to have facebook only function in wifi.  OR worse for Sprint, they'll hear about T-mobile giving you an incredibly affordable data plan and only slowing you down a bit when you go over your limit with not a single overage fee.  Honestly, I switched to T-mobile last month, and I think they're going to take a chunk out of Verizon and at&amp;t's profits.  For the 20 somethings without a lot of money to spend and the generally frugal, the price is too competitive.  T-mobile will continue to see transfers to their service, and they'll find better merger prospects in the coming years as they slowly invigorate themselves with those smaller margins and growing subscribers."

2014-08-06 00:32:41,Depends on the trader's time horizon. Time decay starts to become a big deal about a month and a half from expiration but the underlying needs to be talked about a lot for there to be volatility. 
2014-08-06 00:19:10,"What do you mean?

You expected a continuation lower but it broke out higher instead?

"
2014-08-06 00:10:10,"Not impossible, but the problem is that the options are usually priced in well enough that it's insanely hard to make money no matter what type of strategy you use to take advantage of the volatility.  

I think buying the stock several weeks to a few months before a potential run-up, and selling just days before the expected FDA announcement is a better approach, especially for small-cap biotechs.  And if you're really clever and good at writing, you can start a website and pump up the stock before the announcement. Just write emotionally-driven feel good stories about the drug's positive effects.  You will most definitely gain followers that way and it will ensure that the run-up occurs almost every time.  If anyone actually tries to do this, you're welcome."

Run-up to set dates like ADCOMs and docs, and post-catalyst action (bounces pref) are the way to go.

Alternatively, you could be right for the wrong reason, and get lucky, sometimes... Or you could be wrong, and lose.

There is just so much risk-loving hype built into these events that they are going to have to beat some significant odds to produce a return.

2014-08-04 21:14:38,thanks for the insight. I think the electric future is with tesla as GM isn't serious about it
2014-08-04 21:07:52,"My father has been long in GM for about a year now much to my dismay he  bought at 38 almost a year ago and has been down for 90% of that time. I was in big favor of GM going into  the summer their 2014 models were beautiful especially their GMC line. With that being said other companies have caught on to using nice chrome upgraded rims on theri base models and the new LED lights that only GM and Audi had before 2015. Long story short I dont like any of their new 2015 models nearly as much as their 2014 with that said I dont think they will sell as well and I wouln't buy the stock reguardless of how low it goes. There are better investments.

The other guy said the future enlies with the Volt which again I disagree. The Volt is a VERY small part of their sales and the EV market at least for the next 6 monthes isnt going to have an impact on their stock price in a good or bad way. 

"
2014-08-04 20:49:47,"I don't beleive they have ever made a profit on the volt. The last time I looked they seemed kind of expensive. And where I live I see lots of telsas, leafs Prius's, etc. but I see as many volts as I see unicorns. 

I don't see the value in GM... Except for their trucks which people seem to like. "
2014-08-04 20:35:06,"I think these two brands will be the leaders. if tesla can make theirs affordable and succeed in their battery visions, tesla ftw.

I think a documentary you'd enjoy would be ""the revenge of the electric cars"" which goes over teslas entry to the market, as well as the volt, and the problems they have overcome and are now facing."
2014-08-04 20:16:09,"I believe their future lies in the Volt. It is the best marketed EV right now, other than Tesla. 

I'm interested to see what they can do moving forward. If they can find a way to keep quality and lower cost, they may be in front of the EV race before long. 

They have the manufacturing power that Tesla doesn't, and a lot of their technology. With competition getting better and better it's how they up their game. Ford is strong right now because they got in front of the hybrid train, GM may be able to do the same with EV."

2015-02-13 09:22:30,"As a software developer, here's my take:

Macs started to get really popular in the software development community between 2005-2008, because of build quality and OS X. While the PC builders have gotten better, at the time, the build quality of Apple's laptops was just so much better than what Dell, HP, and the rest were producing. Likewise, in that time frame, Linux on laptops was still fairly painful (It's *still* fairly painful, but it's gotten better), and it's not like Linux actually has a sizeable market share, even amongst software developers, I'd guess only ~20% of devs actually run it on their own machines. However, OS X was suddenly a unix that even Windows people could happily use. So Macs began to dominate software development circles. I mean, even people who spent all their time writing .NET were buying macs!

Now, however, I see the pendulum swinging the other way. OS X has become increasingly buggy and bloated, and is actively upsetting developers. The rise of multicore and tools like Vagrant and Docker means a lot of devs are doing their development against a Linux VM most of the time, so they don't actually need the host machine to be a unix.

I actually think that in 2016, WIndows is going to start clawing back some of those developers who jumped ship for OS X in the previous decade. I mean, as a longtime mac user, I'd love to see the next release of OS X actually fix a lot of the complaints many of us have, but I'm just not sure how much Apple actually cares right now."

2015-02-13 08:23:55,"&gt; Average traders don't have the ability to trade oil futures without paying a premium, and right now the oil ETNs that are popular such as $OIL or $USO aren't a good investment because the futures price is above the expected future spot price.

Not that it's a big deal, but USO isn't an ETN. It's an actual ETF. [See here under 'structure' for more.](http://etfdb.com/2010/uso-vs-oil-a-better-crude-oil-etf/)

&gt;With that being said, even if you thought oil prices will go up slowly over the next year, you will still lose money there.

What do you mean there? Do you mean ""lose money"" as in ""not get the most return you could possibly get""? Do you mean ""not beat the S&amp;P500""? Could be on both of them.

Seriously wondering your thoughts on that one. I took the approach of buying USO shares at 17.60 and I've been selling covered calls on them so far. 14% return in the last month, though of course I don't expect to have that success all the time, maybe not even often. "

2015-02-13 01:41:28,"&gt;they limited the user's control over the system so that they couldn't fuck it up

See, this is a common misconception. Since OSX is Unix based, It is far more fuck-uppable (and quickly) due to the legacy of its core design architecture, than Windows which uses a closed kernel. However, it has been those Unix roots which have made the Mac a very popular platform for the power users (who might otherwise chosen Linux). At the same time, OSX made the most common 95% of tasks done on a computer by non-power users extremely easy and accessible to the average user (who would have otherwise favored the Windows, and indeed does when price sensitive). 

The result of serving these two markets very well has meant that Mac software has begun to catch up on what was once a commanding lead by Windows (and which Windows no doubt still maintains), which has in turn allowed Mac to appeal to two final major consumer groups: artists and technicians/scientists.

Software wise, I didn't have an issue with windows 7 or XP (I don't like 8 but that's just preference), and have run a couple Linux distros too, so I really don't care.

I believe this is because pop culture has made it popular to have a Mac as well as people realizing that while they pay more for the computer they generally  last for a long time. 

This brings me to another point. Throughout middle and high school I had a part time job selling computer and laptops. During that time I was an avid windows user and firsthand witnessed the changes the pv market went through from a power user AND regular consumers point of view. The main problem was that windows would eventually slow down or break or become frustrating to use. This was inevitable no matter what I tried. When I left for college I made sure I got Mac and I have been happy ever since. 

Not to say macs don't have problems, they have problems all the time (just ask some 2011 Macbook owners). However the genius bar at Apple is an amazing service and having an in house service option from the manufacturer/seller works really well for regular people. 

These are only a few points, but they contribute heavily to the revenue this product lineup generates. "

What it takes to run a house is minimal compared to what it takes to move a car.  It may seem like a house is a giant energy user, but compared to a car, it is not that much.  (My dad's 40HP generator will run his entire barn and quite large house, major appliances and all simultaneously, for example, and it's considered overkill.)

Of course, you have to charge batteries, which suggests local generation, most likely solar.  If you are just charging them from the grid, then there is not a lot of point, though it can be used to buffer high/low demand, and can serve as a whole house battery backup in the event of power failure.  

In an area with a lot of wind power, at times when the wind is low, the batteries can pick up the slack, and at times when demand is low, instead of idling the turbines they could charge batteries.   The same could be done for other periodic generator methods (solar, tidal, some forms of hydro, kite energy, etc.).   In fact, battery backup is a form of energy storage that can enable some forms of energy generation that otherwise are not practical, due to it's sporadic availability."

If the grid is charging your batteries then what's the point? If you live in a place where electricity is always on/off sure, but in most developed countries where people would be able to afford this tech, it probably wouldn't be needed. "
2015-02-12 19:05:48,"Well the I hear that the thing with solar is that you have to be connected to the grid. Power you produce is sold to the grid and then you buy power back.

Pretty common.   A whole house battery would be awesome.

Another application is industrial and remote power.  No more noisy generators at the county fair, or on a movie set, for example.

2015-02-12 01:22:15,"&gt;Company A is a $160 billion powerhouse that owns more than 100 global television networks, plus 7 movie studios, 4 video game companies, and hundreds of websites. Not to mention a little-known research laboratory that's developing the next generation of TV technology. (Like a new system that lets you use any object in your house — including your couch, your coffee table, even a glass of water — as a remote control). In fact, this company's growth potential is so strong that legendary hedge fund investor George Soros just snapped up a million shares.

Company B rose from the ashes of a declining newspaper empire. Now it's cultivating a niche TV audience that's especially attractive to advertisers. Allowing this company to generate more than $2.5 billion in revenue from more than 170 million viewers.

According to Investor's Business Daily, even though the entertainment industry is extremely lucrative, it actually has ""a puny number of high quality stocks."" And those are two of them.

Company C didn't make IBD's list...because it isn't really an entertainment company. In fact, even though it operates some of the most popular channels on TV (reaching more than 1.5 billion viewers in 180 countries), its business model is completely different. Its most important customers are actually elementary and high schools. And now it's entering another $25 billion education market with a breakthrough product that's half of the price of the traditional choice. So you can see why this company has been able to grow its earnings per share by an annualized 28% during the past five years.

I got optimistic a bit too soon (I hadn't noticed some important Info that had come along, I should check everyday). This important swap is now ending, should cause a bounce now...

2015-08-22 13:43:18,"You could be right, especially if the iPhone release next month isn't appealing to the consumer.  Apple could be in a lull until September 2016 because so much of this success is dependent on iPhone sales.  

Is it possible that Disney drops all the way down to the 80s.  Yes, definitely.  But with Star Wars in November, Shanghai Disney in December, and the overall adjustments that will be made to have views subscribing to their content; I think Disney could possibly be in better shape than Apple.

Patience is the most important thing.  If you can afford to hold onto these stocks during the dip, you will certainly see profits in the long-term.  Both Apple and Disney were both undervalued to begin with.  And all this talk about a price correction is ridiculous.  Quite frankly, Apple investors are probably selling off to lower the price of Apple shares so that they can go back and buy low and reap short term rewards from a potential stock increase after the iPhone 6s/6s+ release."
2015-08-22 13:35:50,The fact of the matter is that these media companies are content providers.  Eventually things will even out and people will pay in some way to have access to the content being provided.  The stocks will recover and more than likely surpass its peak.  It's all about being patient enough to reap the benefits.
2015-08-22 13:33:29,"Being patient and having a diversified portfolio is what I'm doing to stay afloat.  The key is to not panic.  Hindsight is always 20/20 but should've, would've, could've (s) are irrelevant.  Luckily, Disney and Apple are two of the biggest companies in the world, so I I'm sure the stocks will recover.  It's all about being patient.  A week or two ago, Apple's stock price took a dive, but then it recovered and got all the way up to $119.  Regardless of the state of the Chinese economy, they will be spending to go to Shanghai Disney.  Star Wars in November and Shanghai Disney in December; things will be looking up year end for Disney."

Do you look for gaps on individual stocks only, or also consider the sector or whole market?


I've noticed gaps in SPY before, these often get filled sometime later, but not always. 

If I remember correctly, there was an Island gap around the March 2009 bottom (6-10th I think). However this has not been filled (so far ?!?!)

Regards 22/8/2015  $spx, it looks like a gap around 2034. But the SPY has no gap, from what I saw at stockcharts.com


I just saw this interesting article on using opening gaps to avoid bad set-ups.

When combined with another strategy, it does look to have some merit. I'll save this tread for later :)

Did you follow the Markets or Finance back in 2007/2008?


In 2007 there was a huge inverted bond yield curve, The FED kept on ""taking away the punch bowl"", even as sub-prime property speculators &amp; investors kept on jumping on the bandwagon..

Meanwhile Bond investors saw a huge slowdown ahead and piled into long bonds.


Then Bear Stearns collapsed (early 2008), then Lehmans October 2008.
There was all the signs of contagion in the unbalanced economy.
So it was not a random occurrence, more like a series of events.


Where will the next series of events be? I've not seen it yet, but maybe it centres around China, or Student debt?

Will there be a S&amp;L, LTCM, WorldCom, Bear Stearns, MF Global moment ?!?!

Bear market is here. I wonder what the Federal Reserve will do to reinflate this bubble again. I suspect No interest rate hike in September and more QE down the road. Even if the Fed does raise rates, they will end up cutting them again and then reapplying QE. Too bad none of these options have ever worked though.

Besides, new Star Wars movie coming out this year, so there's so hope as well for Disney...unless it turns out really bad, of course. It will  most likely give Disney a nice bump for quite some time. 
The potential is here for both of them, we just have to wait and see, I guess. "
2015-08-22 07:00:38,"Selling them is your best option then, it may get even worse later. But then again, no one knows what's gonna happen in a few hours. It's always risky in this market, you're supposed to have realized it by now, right? Sorry if I sounded like a captain obvious here though, it's all new to me as well. "
2015-08-22 06:34:19,"Thanks for your reply. I only have an account with Robinhood right now. I know about puts and calls, but don't know what service I should use for that. Would you recommend etrade or something else?"
2015-08-22 06:12:22,"Honest answer: we're due for a correction, and probably more than the 10% we're seeing right now.  When it happens it might be truly ugly.  This could be the beginning of that, or we could hear some positive words from the Fed on Monday and see the market rally right back and shoot for the highs again.  Nobody knows.

The problem with what you're asking is that if you follow your gut you'll find yourself in the ""buy high sell low"" pattern that retail investors always seem to fall into.  It always feels the worst right before things turn around, and the compulsion to buy is always highest right as the market is about to turn over and start falling.

So we don't know if you should sell or not.  Maybe selling makes the most sense.  Maybe you sell, and 15 minutes later things start to rally - it's happened to all of us, so maybe you should just get it out of your system.  But learning how to take losses is part of this game.

Personally, I think you should look into learning about put options and how you can protect against market reversals like this.  You lose some upside by paying the equivalent of an insurance premium, but you defend against the downside of events like these so at least theoretically you make better returns over time.  "
2015-08-22 05:30:54,"Well technical analysis is itself a self-fulfilling prophecy so there is some truth to the idea that people thinking there will be a correction (note I said correction and not crash) may actually lead to one. I just have watched the market long enough to know that what goes up must come down. We can't just go straight up forever. The market ebbs and flows like the tides. People buy low, sell high. Everyone who buys eventually takes profit whether it's in their own lifetime or the next generation's, so over time there will inevitably be periods where lots of people want to take profit and other investors and traders get spooked out and cause panic and the like. It's all part of the nature of the market which was my point. I have been browsing Reddit the last few weeks and lately every single down move there are like 15 posts saying OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! so I was just trying to give people some insight since this is what I do for a living :)

EDIT: BTW I wasn't saying we stay at $165, haha I was just saying if things got really panicky that's where I would expect to see a bounce. I don't expect it to even get that low. If we sell off we probably go to like 175-180 and then start to grind back up to new highs. "
2015-08-22 05:24:53,"You're right. It doesn't have anything to do with that. See my response above...this article's title is kind of silly. It's also more cost effective to buy 200 shares instead of 100 if you're trading w/ a flat rate commission, which are both normal lots. "
2015-08-22 05:20:27,"Firstly it's not a ""wiki"" link posted above so I'm not sure what you're talking about. The investopedia article above is just saying that if you buy 60 shares with a $5 commission the ""commission per share"" is more than if you buy 100 shares with $5 commission (no shit...just like the cost per share is lower if you buy 500 vs 100, or 1 million vs 500k...not really sure why that link is posted cause it really has nothing to do w/ odd lots even though the title says the words).

Secondly I said nothing about cost and didn't say that you were wrong about never being charged for odd lots so don't get your panties in a bunch. You're not even talking about the same instrument anyway. A single ""contract"" as you referenced refers to 100 shares in options, or a single futures contract, both of which represent a normal lot size. An odd lot in a stock is totally different. What I said was that odd lots in stock trading will be filled WITH LOWER PRIORITY because they are less cost-effective for market makers and brokers (which is true). So if you place an order to sell, say, 517 shares, you will most likely get 500 in a single block (or blocks of 100, 200, etc) and be left over with 17 shares because it's a pain in the ass and not cost effective for the broker or market maker to find someone who wants to buy such a small/random amount of shares, especially if it's a cheap stock. If it's a liquid stock this isn't usually a problem in today's environment because an HFT will snatch up the last 17 from you relatively quickly, but in the event you're trading a thin stock there's a chance you will have to cancel the rest of the order and resend it at a lower price in order to fill the last 17 shares. That would cost you extra commission which is annoying and can usually be avoided by trading in multiples of 100. 

Anyway my original point was just that the original response saying OP should buy 20 shares instead of 19 because 20 is easier to fill is just plain silly because both 19 and 20 are odd lots and both will be filled with equally low priority vs a standard lot trade. 

In other words, calm your tittays"

2016-02-26 17:23:04,"Wow. That shit is all garbage.  /r/personalfinance are kind of boring ""watch it grow"" type people, but they do have some good advice on this basic stuff.  Just be cautious about their attitude toward investing.  They all think the most important thing is to save every penny for retirement, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your goals.  Personally Im not a fan of saving up for my death.

Anyway.  All those banking services are garbage.  Probably not free checking, ATM fees, shitty to no interest rates.  Dont use them for anything.

You need to go with a local credit union or an internet only bank:

Local credit unions will generally be the friendliest, have good loan rates, and still have ""brick and mortar"" buildings if you are clinging to old fashioned banking ideals.  They have the co-op ATM network so its really easy and free to get cash when you need it.  Every 7-11 Ive ever seen has a co-op ATM.

I found my local credit union to be frustratingly deficient on the technology front, so I switched over to Ally which is an internet only bank.  The whole idea that you need a physical building to keep your money in is bullshit these days.  Even with a physical building, your cash becomes an intangible number in a computer anyway. So far they have amazing customer service and with all the internet friendly features, they turned out to be WAY more convent than my local credit union.  Plus they give you a full 1% on savings accounts (as opposed to the 0.02% on that Huntington garbage) + free checks and some interest on my checking account.  They have a very friendly and convenient mobile platform as well as free ways to electronically send people money.  They use the same ATM co-op network for free cash withdrawal and also reimburse you up to $10 for ATM fees.

Whatever you do, avoid the big guy like BOA, Wells Fargo, etc.  They are set up to extract money from you and I have never heard of them having good customer service or anything else.  They are the stupid poor persons choice for financial institutions.

You also need a rewards credit card with no annual fee if you dont have one.

I try to learn as much as I can about a company: what products it sells, what it plans to sell, and how those products are selling.  google for instance is a juggernaut....it is not only invested in it's search engine but in almost every cutting edge technology that I predict will bear fruit decades from now-- too much to list.  Amazon is also another and recently the stock went into the $400 dollar range-- that was a great time to buy because I have not seen the stock hit that price in recent times.

Something like SDIV could give you steady monthly dividends that you could use to supplement your income. That fund has given a $0.1205 dividend per month, which, at the current price of $18.39, is a .0065 yield. Your 6k **might** get you $39.31 per month in extra income. You should always try to keep your money in the market (aka, reinvest your dividends) to accumulate wealth over time and get you in a better financial standing. All of these numbers are current and assume that the fund will issue the same dividend in the future, but all of this could change, and that's a risk you'd have to consider before investing.

2016-02-25 14:53:14,"This dramatic fall has created a net harm to the economy. The supposed $700 in savings for the average consumer has been more than offset by a number of factors. There have been hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in the oil field alone. The low energy costs have dropped production and profits, and have wrecked the balance sheets, in every other energy sector. Falling oil rig counts has hurt steel manufacturers that produce the heavy steel needed for the industry, and as so, the transportation industry is not transporting as much large goods either. As well, trains famously transport crude and coal, of which domestic production has been dramatically dropping for both, which is cutting into the revenue for that section of the transportation industry. Increased competition from trucking is also hurting the train industry. The airline industry is not benefiting as much as was expected. 

""In all, 9 million Americans earn their livelihood in industries tied to oil and gas, not just in drilling but in all the ancillary services that support drilling and production. That wraps in jobs in finance, transportation, cement making, helicoptering, welding, geology, engineering … it’s a long list."" 

We've also seen the banking/investment dramatically hurt over the effects of bad debt within the domestic oil production sector. The Bush doctrine of increasing domestic production to cut dependency on Middle Eastern oil has ironically backfired as OPEC's oversupply has clearly created large damage in what has become an economy highly dependent on the industries that are tied together through domestic supply. 

The crash in China hasn't helped either, which seems to have been a catalyst for a perfect storm that's causing a global recession in conjunction with all the other factors I mentioned and the reliance of other global economies on their own oil exports. "

2016-02-25 12:17:36,"I find it interesting how as more rhetoric is pumped out by media sources regarding the collapse of oil and recent market returns, the more people seem to neglect the fact that correlation and causation are vastly different. Perhaps the recent volatility in markets is due to the volatility of chicken egg prices?

Ok, perhaps that is an excessive example, but it brings up the point that markets have a greater correlation to the M1 money supply over the last 4 years than the market has to crude oil. It's [no secret](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=3zVx) that the growth of the money supply has slowed.

Just saying, as an investing community, we need to realize there are many variables influencing the markets and we should stop asserting that only one factor (oil) is causing the market doldrums. "

If you can sell a share to *anyone* for $10, why would you sell it to me? You wouldn't care. Unless I come to you and say ""I'm willing to pay $14/share to anyone willing to sell!"" NOW you'd be interested, and I'd gain a lot of shares and concentrate my control over the company.

2016-09-05 09:36:54,"I like this. Somebody here mentioned that it's not the stats that's going to convince people, it's basically their trust in you. Again, here's my feedback - hope this helps.

&gt; Experts say the virtual reality and augmented reality enterprise could be valued in the neighborhood of 30 to 50 billion dollars when the market for this product arrives, which they’re starting to do.

This is exactly what I'd like to hear: why it's even important. Even the next line about Zuckerberg is good, I think that can help build more credibility for your case.

&gt; I’m nineteen I love this market, I love its demographic makeup. Younger generation even younger than me, are heavily infected with the gaming bug. From my own personal reasons it’s something I’m close to and pay attention to regularly.

This was a great line - I think people will like the fact that this type of product is right in your domain...it's something you know and understand. You're also being unapologetic about being young which is good, and your framing it as being a positive thing.

I wouldn't be surprised if some older folks who hear this start going on about how video games are all their little Jimmy does, etc.

&gt; For all the reasons I just mentioned what do you think of buying shares of Sony @ thirty two dollars?

This is where I think you need to shake things up a bit. Before you close it up, I'd like to know the stuff you have under ""Addition:"". In simple terms, why is Sony so special? I'd like to hear something along the lines of 'well, the PS4 is killing it and Xbox is old news'. But why do you think Sony's VR plan superior to other candidates, why are they well positioned? That'd really tie your pitch together."

Apple stock generally drops on the day of release by 1% or so, and start picking up as apple registers record orders (somehow its always has record number of pre-orders/orders for the 1st week :) )

2016-09-04 23:22:40,"well that is certainly true ... i'm not gonna disagree with you there ... and you obviously bring up an excellent point about valuations at these prices

truth be told i'm actually not looking for much higher levels from here myself ... i'm mostly just looking for the russell to make a new high print but ultimately fail ... kind of like a FOBO (fake out break out) ... perhaps that would mark the final death knell (aka, blow-off top?) of this post-BREXIT rally if you will? but not necessarily the be all and end all on the bull market per say...

i tend to agree w/ you about people being waaaay too complacent ... i don't like to measure investor complacency solely by looking at VIX, but its hard to ignore when you see 11-handle prints there ... that gets my attention for sure ... as the old adage goes ""when the vix is low it's time to go; when the vix is high it's time to buy"" ...

there are so many risk events out there that could rattle the apple cart so-to-speak ... one of which imo and is unavoidable would be the upcoming presidential elections here in the states ... which imho if at any point the markets start sensing a turn in the polls where the republican candidate is starting to make even the slightest comeback in any way, could start to get markets a little edgy ... i don't see how the markets can possibly ignore this all through the election personally

europe ain't fixed, china still has its issues, and there are still a lot of hot spots out there in the world with fighting wars and the like, and we still don't know wtf the FED is going to do with interest rates, do they hike do they wait ... so much hype yet little to nothing done lol

anyway, not to get too lengthy with the post here ... i think you are right to feel the way that you do about this market (truthfully i am to a degree as well) at some point this fed hopium will end ... nothing lasts forever ... i do feel much of this rally has been orchestrated by the FED ... fed-induced if you will

the correction will come, and it's just a healthy process of markets anyway ... whether it's a -10% or -20% draw down ... something will have to give sooner or later i think ... but when that day comes is truly anyone's guess i suppose

we'll see what happens in these next coming months ahead as we near EOY ... i think we will see a pick up in volatility as we near the election ... but then once that has passed we should see a nice santa rally through year's end ... however i say that and look what happened last year ... we had a failed santa rally! lol

eek! sorry for the long post! didn't think it was going to go this long ... have a good trading week! and thx for your input in here! :)"

2016-09-04 20:08:14,"I can't speak to what kind of talk track a broker needs to have at all, but here's some questions I'd have based off of your response.

&gt; Alright well I believe the virtual reality market is about to explode with the cult like following it has coming online right now. Every cutting edge entertainment manufacturer is getting into this and if Steve Jobs was alive right now he's be the first person talking about them.

Why is it about to explode? What's the market potential? From what I understand there's some huge barriers for customers to get into VR. The equipment itself is expensive and you need a high powered machine to run anything. There's also a lot of players giving VR their best shot, what makes you think Sony has a competitive advantage over them?

&gt; Aside from this though, Sony's first place in the gaming console market with the PS4 doubling the sales of Xbox One which brings in huge revenues being as Sony gets a cut of every game sold on their platform.

How important is this to Sony's business model, is this their main source of revenue? Are there other critical aspects of their company that need to be contemplated?

&gt; I think this stock has lots of room to run for its good EPS and near 50 P/E. The technicals are great and the analyst concensus is targeting this stock at $42 in the next twelve months. 

How does the PE stack up against competition? Does the current share price have a lot of growth factored into it?

Also you have a lot to say about the technicals, but if I'm looking for an investment I want to know more about the fundamentals. Their cash flow, liquidity, growth, and the qualitative (SWOT) type of stuff that makes me believe there's a tangible balance between my expected return and the risk of the position."

still no -20% correction since this mega bull run started and only 3 solid -10% or greater corrections since then as well ... should be interesting to see just how much longer this streak can go on ... question would be do we make it through another 2 years and actually break that record long run 90s raging bull? that would be epic if it did ... we shall see lol :)"

2016-09-04 05:47:15,"&gt; my bad, what i meant to do was show the pullbacks on a ""closing"" basis not ""intraday"" whoops! i had the right idea here, but i used the wrong levels in this exercise since i used the ultimate intraday highs and lows for each pullback when i meant to use the closing highs and lows in this example ... my fault lol
&gt; the main reason why that is so important is because i wanted to show how long it has been since we have seen price come in -20% or greater (on a closing basis not intraday!) since the march 2009 bear lows
&gt; this might be a better chart to use here for my example - CLICK ME!
&gt; that chart uses the ""closing"" levels on the $SPX, whereas my chart in this thread uses the ""intraday"" levels -- which is okay and all, but obviously as you can see the difference between my chart, and of the one that i had just posted up in here in this post -- we have not seen price come in even at a minimum of -20% off highs yet since this bull market began! albeit we came awfully close in 2011, but just missed it by a hair, hah!
&gt;

2016-09-04 00:46:23,"Completely aligning with your thoughts here. I'd like to add we'll see some more tight choppy market as we head into FED's decision. The SP500 might touch 2200 after FED's decision of not raising interest rates and after that we might( i hope we do.. ) see some volatility / dip in the markets because of election uncertainty. 

I also predict trump to lose by only getting 30% of the votes and markets to rally until end of the year! (we'll find out :), sorry if I offend anyone here with this comment)

&gt; **[CLICK ME!](http://i.imgur.com/6e5tGyr.png)**

well, this was a bit tedious to put together lol, but i just wanted to make sure i got all of my #'s correct (case in point -- i am pretty meticulous and kind of a perfectionist when it comes to bringing up past data)

i doubled and triple checked my #'s here ... they are 100% accurate

what you see in my above chart is literally what the title says ... these are literally EVERY single pullback off highs of at least -5% (although i say -5% ... there are actually a few that are slightly less than that) in the cash s&amp;p 500 ever since the market bottomed back on march 6th 2009 (on an intraday basis)

all figures are taken from the intraday high of the move, down to the intraday low, and that's where you get the percentage figure for each respective pullback

some might think this is quite a meaningless chart to post here ... but personally i think it's kind of fascinating to see just how incredibly powerful this bull market has been since its inception in march 2009

one of the longest standing bull run's in market history ... and still we're only just -1.67% off the latest ATHs literally (from the ATHs of 2193.81 down to this past week's intraday low of 2157.09 = **-1.67%**)! in other words -- nothing to see here carry on lol!

resilient market is resilient and has been for 7+ years running now...

when this all ends is obvoiusly anyone's guess ... but let it be said here that NOTHING lasts forever (duh) ... at some point the music ends ... but obviously there is no sense in trying to fight it or time it, etc ... ride the way while it lasts

whether this has all been orchestrated by the FED (""the fed induced rally as some might coin it"") or not, still you just cannot deny that this has been one helluva breathtaking bull market run! i probably will never see anything like this again in my lifetime...

have a great long weekend r/StockMarket! :)

seems like its at an interesting area here on the chart ... stopped right on trendline support on friday ... you think bounce here? selloff seems a little overdone, no? maybe make one more higher low here? albeit the thing i don't like here is that it is trading underneath all the major moving averages and it closed on the lows on friday...too much momentum still on the downside?

thx!"
2016-09-03 09:27:08,"hi /u/username120415 sorry for my delayed response here!

honestly, there's really nothing all that noteworthy to tell you here, it wasn't a pick i chose because of the chart or anything...

it's no secret that abercrombie &amp; fitch is a garbage company (imo anyway) ... why do i say this? first, i was pretty disappointed about how their ceo apparently made a big stink about their stores not catering to heavy set people and supposedly being an ass bout it to boot? wow! ... i know of someone who was looking into their stores the other day and was interested in an item but they didn't have anything for his size, and they were almost in a way ridiculing him for even ""asking"" which i just personally found absurd imo

i don't mean to offend anyone here if we have fans of anf apparel, but c'mon... if you can't cater to everyone, then you can go to hell lol (relax....but i'm j/k of course)

but, i really couldn't care what happens with the stock here ... the place is garbage in my opinion anyway ... hence why i picked it short prior to its ER ... and, well, it obviously shows lol

other than that, there wasn't really anything special i saw as far as the chart was concerned...

anyway, thx for the post! ... and i hope to see you participate in our next contest in 2 weeks! :)"

2016-09-03 08:20:20,"i was meaning to post this chart update in here at month's end august on wednesday but today will do as we're approaching the end of the summer doldrums finally...

here are the official percentage changes for the major indices, wtd, mtd, qtd, and ytd -- **[CLICK ME!](http://i.imgur.com/AQ1AG0I.png)**

it has been a pretty wild year for these markets thus far to say the least...

from the very beginning of the year correction (which was one of the worst starts to any year in the markets in history!) to the brexit panic lows that we saw back in late june, here we are having entered the month of septembmer (which btw is notoriously known as being the worst month for markets all year...) still flirting with ATHs for the major averages ... thus far we are still contained within august's unprecedented narrow trading range, albeit the month has just only gotten underway here ... interestingly the vix closed back with an 11-handle for the week

i am wondering if we are just going to continue this horrific chop fest in this very tight range that we saw much of last month, leading up into the FOMC meeting which is scheduled for september 21st @2pm

i know i had conducted a fed rate hike poll in here the other week ... in fact here were the final results even before yesterday's NFP's -- **[CLICK ME!](http://i.imgur.com/sSyVqt5.png)**

pretty interesting how it was overwhelmingly in the favor of ""no"" even well before that payroll # yesterday ... and now that we got that meaningless # out of the way, has anything really changed?

anyway, for the sake of the markets let's hope for some much needed volatility this month!

personally, i will be shocked if we are to continue to chop it up in this range for much more longer than this ... especially with the u.s. presidential elections on the horizon (we're literally just 8 weeks away!) i think once we've gotten this next fed meeting out of the way in a few weeks, markets will start taking notice of the elections which could stir up some volatility, especially if the markets start sensing a comeback by the republican candidate imo

we'll see what happens! i hope you guys had a terrific summer trading, albeit kinda boring, but hey, that isn't to say there ain't any $$$ to be made in a boring market! lol

hope you all have an awesome long holiday weekend in the states! last unofficial week of summer ... it's amazing to me how quickly this summer has come and gone! admittedly, i will be a little sad to see it go lol ... but on the flip side i will welcome much needed cooler temps! this was one of the hottest summers on records i heard from one source the other week.

catch you guys next week!

Statistics fail.

If you have a binary (single-elimination) bracket, of course the winner is going to have flipped all heads.

If you run the tournament by requiring that the winner has (1) flipped the most heads and (2) consistently tended to beat a 50% average, THAT is a fair comparison.

Then, after running 100+ rounds (because 2^10 is simply not a large enough N), if someone has flipped heads 70% of the time, with every decile of their play beating 50%, either they've trained themselves to flip a coin 2N half-rotations, or that coin is lopsided.

THAT is a fair comparison."

2017-03-14 15:28:43,"&gt;  yet there is no underlying mathematical (or physical) strategy that could be employed by the flippers to consistently win.

That's not the same here, though. The medallion fund doesn't hand pick stocks and hold them. They program models that look at correlations in the market and then their proprietary algorithms decide what to trade based on these correlations. They employ over 90 Ph.D's to model the market and generate the returns they do. There is mathematics and strategy behind their trades.

A more apt comparison, in my opinion, would be an expert blackjack player. Sure, they can never know completely what anyone else hand is but they can make an educated guess based on past moves and then decide how to play based on that.
"
2017-03-14 15:23:40,"It could, and I won't say I know enough statistics to say it isn't but looking at the length of time the fund has been operating and its returns during that period, I would bet it isn't. 

The sp500 has returned 9.2% cagr from 1994 to 2014. The medallion fund has return 72% cagr over that time period. Even in one year earning 72% is many many standard deviations above the market return and then doing that for 20 years just seems too probable for me to believe its survivorship bias."
2017-03-14 15:11:01,"Malkiel also addressed this in the book. He analogized it with a coin flipping tournament with 1,000 players. Eventually, the tournament would produce the champions' bracket with the players flipping heads consecutively to beat out the other players. They would surely be seen as ""coin flipping experts"" due to their seemingly winning strategies, yet there is no underlying mathematical (or physical) strategy that could be employed by the flippers to consistently win.

Malkiel likened these successful hedge-funds and managers as the 'lucky coin flippers' that came out ahead, despite the thousands of other individuals not so lucky.

Not saying I agree whole-heartedly with either camp, but it's interesting nonetheless."

It wasn't in reference to projecting the market conditions from now to 500 years in the future."

2017-03-14 14:14:45,"The efficient market hypothesis, the idea that a security's price accurately reflects all public information, is total hogwash in my opinion.  Markets are not efficient at all.  A lot of the movement is just noise.  Large players can temporarily take markets out of balance.  Watch the DOM for a day to see for yourself.

Now as far as funds go the issue is that the way markets work make it difficult for any fund to maintain an edge for long.  An edge that is large enough for funds to take advantage of is going to be detected by the market, and filled by competition.  This eliminates that edge.  

However, small retail investors can still find an edge.  They have advantages that big institutions don't have.  They can still win by picking good stocks through fundamental analysis.  They can still win by taking advantage of the market making and auction processes that drive price movement.

Of course, most people won't be profitable in such venture.  But such edges do exist for those willing to do the work."

You are betting on a tremendous amount of volatility in the bottom half of the gold miners index.

You cannot be a long term holder of JNUG, as the continuous rollover of the underlying derivatives erodes the unit value.  It is best suited to playing sharp directional moves, and then getting off the position.

2017-03-13 17:53:49,"In this scenario, it wasn't really an 8% yield, but there are investments that do actually yield 8%.  That doesn't mean it's a guaranteed 8% total return.  An 8% yield just means its most recent dividends will pay 8% based off current price.  These dividends can be lowered, and the price also can drop.  So even if they do continue to pay the same dividend, you can easily lose money on the share price decreasing."

2017-08-24 04:38:15,"My personal reasons to stop my membership:

Perhaps good to add to my original post. My personal reason to stop taking his report, was simple. What triggered me to subscribe, even though his fee is relatively high to other subscribers, was that MMT Economics caught my attention and being in trading for years dealing with optimising trade entries and exits, I know that a hard stop does not work. This is also claimed by Michael Norman, and there is scientific evidence for this too.

However, following his trade recommendations it remained unclear to me what his relative sizing is and how big my account should be in order to be able to participate in all his recommendations on forex, equities, etf's, stocks, commodities and futures. To do all his trades I need an enormous account of close to 1 mln USD in order to play stocks against the futures he uses as bad hedges.

Until that day he recommended a forex trade, i got in but it was not mentioned in his next report. I reported this with him, and his reply was: ""I forgot it because I am not personally in this trade myself.""

I was shocked, this meant he did not take his own advice, and in combination with him preaching mental game to hold on to losing trades (that should have been closed, even without working with stop-loss orders) I really felt scammed because he is not losing himself.

On top of this, he added the position to his report the moment it got in the money. 

This could be a one time mistake, but perhaps you have the same experience with some trades?"

And as always, remember Wikipedia isn't guaranteed to be the truth. 


As one person mentioned, they are spreading to other areas, such as Amazon is. 

I know that they are big in mobilepayments in China (Alipay), they have a consumer and a wholesale business (alibaba/aliexpress). They are expanding into cloud computing, Alipay is a product under ant financial. It's the biggest finte company in the world, and also has credit rating, money market etc. 

There are rumors that they are about to start collaboration with ripple (cryptocurrency), but it has been denied that they have made an agreement (not that they are working on one). 

It is the largest retailer in the world. Surpassed wallmart in 2016.


The amount of goods grossed is larger than eBay and Amazon combined. 

It has expanded into media and entertainment where it has 3 digit growth. I believe they have funded some movies etc. 
They also have ownership in football. 

They have more than 80% of all internet sales in china

They also own parts of groupon. 

They have designed a car, and have startet taking pre-orders. 

They make maps

They have an instant messaging service

Own a newspaper. 

A medical supplier

Own browser. 


They havde had ownership in yahoo. (might still have, unsure). 

Largest ipo ever at the time. (might still be). 



One of the differences (as far as I know) is that Amazon sells goods alongside their sellers. Ali doesn't sell anything by themselves. "

What is the current ""climate situation"" that could potentially affect this particular stocks' valuation? Fundamentals are good and sound, but forecasting based on climate alone is very risky. Many people lost a lot of money by doing exactly that. "
2017-08-23 16:01:16,Well I think it's time to ride the bull it just closed at 15.09 tomorrow it will probably dip down a little but I could see SNAP gain 20% within the next few weeks.

2017-08-23 07:39:53,"Some people think it will come sooner, some people think it will come later. Truth is nobody knows, and by the time a downturn comes it's possible that things have gone up so much it's still ahead of where it is today. That's why 'buy the dip' isn't a sure thing."

2017-08-22 22:43:46,"Snapchat is starting to take the place of texting for the younger generations. Because it is instantaneous and disappears right away, it more closely resembles real conversation to them and appeals to their need for immediacy. Texting is closer to emailing for them because you can read it and answer at your own convenience without seeming like an asshole ignoring it, unless of course you have read receipts on. Just what I have noticed from the current high schoolers and middle schoolers. "

The only issue I could think of is that I don't see older millienials, xillienials, and Gen X switching over. It would have to rely on younger millienials, Gen Z, and any future new population assuming there won't be a new social app on the scene by then. If Snap's user growth is already slowing, then future growth might be capped by its current advantage."

2018-01-31 11:43:32,"&gt; Day trading has been extensively studied and very few out perform, especially over long term.

Out-performing the stock market long-term is rarely the goal of day trading. Many people do it for income and can earn a steady income trading options whether or not the market is going up or down. The reason they don't beat the market is because they're not reinvesting their gains, they're living off of them.

Most people who repeat the phrase ""trading won't beat the market long term"" don't actually know how or why people trade.

Edit: People who ""buy and hold"" but withdraw money to pay the bills (i.e., retired people) don't beat the market with their investing strategy either... because they're not re-investing gains."

2018-01-31 11:36:47,Day trading is all fundamental analysis...  People break that down in smaller fractions of time and read charts to give them a good estimate on when to buy or sell...
2018-01-31 11:36:13,"Heads up...Ross is a good trader but he makes a looooot of money from his chat room, much more than from trading. It's much easier to take risks in the market when you have a guaranteed 6 figure monthly income from selling DVDs, chat room subscriptions etc outside of trading.

I'm not against day trading by any means (in fact have done it full time since 2013) but just take everything with a grain of salt when it comes to these ""gurus"". His free content is great and there's a ton of it out there you can learn from, just be aware that it's always easier when you have that huge cushion of income from another source, which you most likely won't have right now.

I’m usually thinking that I value an option at $5 and it just dropped to $4. I buy it in the morning at $4. Next thing I know, the stock has recovered and the option is now at $4.8 and even though I like it at $5, I sell it, excited to make 20% in a few hours. I think if I had a much larger amount of money, I could be happy to do the same with stocks. 

Important caveat, I’ve been breaking down my results from last year and my positions taken for less than 30 days were atrocious while my positions taken for longer than 30 were incredible. I would probably be wise to to take a lesson from that and stop with the short duration trades. "

Keep in mind that i am Swedish and therefore have mostly traded the Swedish stockmarket, which i am sure differs in some way from NYSE.  
I do however know that the technique used that i used for stock day trading is widely used in trading institutes in the US, and also London.  
  
It is called flow trading / tape reading and you do basically not look at charts at all. You look at the order book (level 2), the finish ticker and volume. With help of these you try to spot the current trend.  "

2018-01-31 09:34:19,"many things. I day trade. Here is what I use and see in no particular order.

1. Market overreaction - bad news hits and stock drops at it feels like a overreaction try to buy and sell in a short term to make 1 - 5% on the bounce. catch a falling knife, playing the cat bounce is often the references to it.

2. momentum that was explained below.

3. pressure, you see a bunch of pressure building then jump in and out to ride the buy / sell trend that week, day, hour, etc.

4. Target price hit, many have I hope to buy or sell limit order set to 90 days, when it hit it automatically happens.

5. Trending, does the stock start the morning high and sell off through the day - well get in the game skippy and short it in the AM until it fails.

6. Gut, which often is the most successful once you have 5 years under your belt. Sometimes you spidey sense just kicks in and you follow it to profit town.

7. Binary events - earnings, approval from a governing body, product release, etc. get your coin out and make a bet.

8. Subject Matter Expert - if you become an expert in a vertical or industry then over time you see opps to scalp a few points. You know the companies, you know the balance sheets, you know what you think it is worth - boom you have a base line. above short, below buy / call.

9. charting - not even going to get into people drawing cups, people, cats, batman, racetracks, volcanoes, etc.

why are people against day trading? because it is hard. It takes losses. No, a fake money account won't teach you because it has no pain attached to it. But if you are a good student of mistakes and wins then after a year or two you get better and hopefully become profitable."

There are many theories and most use a long term trend. AQR for example uses a 1-3-12 month average (essentially add the 3 returns together and then divide by 3). 

If you're trading with personal money,aka sub $10 million, I wouldn't worry to much about timing the time of the trade. Studies point towards late morning as optimal time in recent market trends. Also, you're most likely the fool if you can't identify the fool in the market...

2018-01-31 05:31:06,Buy the fucking dip! :-)
2018-01-31 05:26:19,"&gt;Can someone explain what the Bid and Ask numbers mean when looking at a stock quote? 
&gt;
&gt;For example; I open my TD app. Search for “Stock A”. Stock A is currently closed at $6.50. Beneath that number is:
&gt;
&gt;Bid: $6.48 (34)
&gt;Ask: $6.52 (60)
&gt;
&gt;What do these numbers mean? I’m more concerned with learning what it means when the stock market is closed.

That means the bid (current highest price someone is willing to buy at, and literally speaking, a pool of buy limit orders at that price) is $6.48. There are 3400 shares (34 lots of 100) in that pool of orders. Could be one order or many, and there's no way to tell since the order book is aggregated, but 99% chance it's many orders, since the market is big :-)

Other side says the same, but for sell orders. Currently there are 6000 shares for sale at a limit of $6.52. 

In this case thus there is a 4 cent ($6.52-6.48) spread and a 2600 share sell imbalance (6000-3400)

&gt;
&gt;At times, the bid number in the (brackets) next to the bid price is MUCH larger than the number inside the ask brackets next to the ask price - and vice versa. What does this indicate and does it provide any useful information?

In after hours it doesn't mean as much because there aren't very many market centers/exchanges open, so there are bound to be big spreads and large imbalances just due to whatever was left on the books when the market closed. During the day however, if you see persistent imbalances it can mean many things and is absolutely significant. You might think a big bid outweighing a big ask is a bullish sign, but in reality smart money doesn't often show their big trades on the book. More likely, if you see a big block of stock being bid it is because someone is trying to create the illusion of a big buyer, in order to prop the stock up so they can sell. Similarly, a big offer can be a bullish sign since it can indicate a large buyer trying to hold the stock down by creating the illusion of a large sell wall. This isn't always the case but without level 2 access and watching the tape (time and sales) in real time it's very difficult to tell since these bids and asks are mostly put there by high frequency trading algorithms that can change them in literal nanoseconds. To determine what's really going on you need to watch the tape and level 2 order book in real time with professional trading software (DAS is my preferred software for this), and do a lot of reading in order to understand how to ""read the tape"" (there's a term to Google for further research). 

That should help!

Impact of high frequency traders: Regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines. Regulators determined that high frequency traders sold aggressively to eliminate their positions and withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.[23][24][25][26] A July 2011 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an international body of securities regulators, concluded that while ""algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk, their usage was also clearly a contributing factor"".[27][28] Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) were the underlying cause of the flash crash. One hypothesis, based on the analysis of bid-ask data by Nanex, LLC, is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-ask spread) to exchanges in batches. Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.[29] However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.[30] Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on May 6.[29][30] On September 3, 2010, the regulators probing the crash concluded: ""that quote-stuffing—placing and then

"
2018-10-08 04:08:04,"&gt; Malls became pretty worthless only recently. Sears had a massive portfolio of top tier real estate for a long time

The problem with malls is they overbuilt, and underserved. The next big business concept is definitely an all-in-one shopping center, or all-in-one store, where you can do everything. People say that's Wal-Mart but it isn't. No place has hit on this concept yet. But the one who figures it out will handsomely profit. It's the same strategy that software companies use. They try to get people under one eco-system.

2018-10-07 16:11:45,"This was an interesting thread that got me curious, so I decided to pull their SEC filings from EDGAR and review their balance sheet and legal filings. 

It looks like Sears has about $5 billion in real estate on the books, and another $5 billion in inventory/goods. It looks like over recent years they’ve had sales of around $15 billion a year, and have $3 billion in loans on the books. They have been averaging a net loss of about $1 billion a year. This only includes Sears Domestic. It does not include Sears Canada nor K-Mart. 

They have a lot more real estate than I expected, but at their current burn rate even if they sold all of it, it still wouldn’t buy them all that much time. "
2018-10-07 15:48:25,Walmart does the same thing... kinda. When a Walmart buys land they offset the store from the road. Knowing that the frontage land is now worth more because a future Walmart will be there. Then they sell that land to McDonalds.

2018-10-07 14:56:10,Billions? I doubt it. Sears has some good real estate but not a lot. There isn’t much of a market for purchasing “dying malls.” Often the renovation costs make it so that companies would rather just build from scratch.

I think it might get to the $84 resistance before it stabilizes / goes slightly bullish for a while. I think this will all happen before the end of the month."
2018-10-07 14:42:37,"The simple explanation is that government bond yields are going up as a result of the interest rate, so some investors are moving funds out of stocks and into bonds, causing stock prices to fall (though the stock values are arguably unchanged). 

I believe the topic you are interested in would be monetary policy, i.e. what the Fed(eral Reserve) does. There has been quite an interesting trail of policy since the 2000s, with quantitative easing now being phased out and the interest rate on the USD being raised to higher levels. "
2018-10-07 14:40:41,"Is Sears real estate really worth that much? I don’t think so, lots of those big box stores sit vacant for years before they’re destroyed. Like CompUSA or Circuit City.

2018-10-07 14:38:15,"MU is a solid long term play . Just buy shares and sell weekly or biweekly calls. The fundamentals are solid. Management is executing really well and future is bright for memory. 

  The problem is the media spreading FUD for their agenda. The problem is the convertible bonds , hold 5% bond and sell calls on it , bash the stock to expire all those almost 1 million open interest in calls .

  Media says memory peaked and it's going to crash, micron says otherwise , it's peaked but not going to crash. Now if you are a big institution , it's better to sell mu and preserve money just in case memory crashes even though every data says otherwise. 

  So I don't see it going anywhere until we experience the bust cycle and Micron prove to the market that all the analysts were talking shit . When that happens this is gonna explode considering by then they had bought back 20% plus of the shares bust cycle expected to happen in 2019 and also look at the put open interest in 2019. 2018 was almost none, 2019 the put open interest matches / higher than calls"

(The new ones at least).  Maybe it's because disneys brand hasn't produced actual quality movies in my opinion besides Pixar films, but I can't personally see myself dropping Netflix to go for Disney.  Netflix has more original content and attempts at creating quality content while Disney is trying to bank on marvel/Star Wars.  I've seen most of them.  Some were fun.

Learn about how monetary value. Money. 

Learn about economics. How money travels throughout an economy and in/out of it. Learn about imports/exports.  Learn why one country relies on imports and another on exports. 

Why did we shift from bartering to trading gold and silver coins, why did we go from gold and silver to  representative money, the supply and transactions of which are facilitated by the government. 

There are a broad range of topics that are all related to money and therefore the stock market and trading. 
I personally believe that an understanding of the 'foundation' of a topic should be first, before diving in and learning its details."
2019-04-16 03:12:31,"Like others have said, day trading is a bad move. However, learning and investing is probably the most profitable move you could possibly make in your life!

Being an avid reader is a massive advantage, I can tell you that first hand.

The 3 must reads, in my own opinion. They contrast each other very well, giving you a great unbiased foundation to build upon. Top 3:

Mindset by Carol S. Dweck
(A non-finance must read for anyone in business. Start here even if it's not about finance.) 

One up on Wallstreet by Peter Lynch
(The best book to start with on finance.) 

Little book of common sense investing by John Bogle. (A must read to understand what you are up against. The best book on investment fallacies and index funds by Bogle himself) 


Other great reads in no particular order:

Built to Last by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras
(a fantastically researched work on how companies are built to last forever) 

Good to great by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras
(In my eyes the best book written on business. How do companies built into something truly great.) 

Stocks in the Long run by Jeremy Seagal

Little book that Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey

Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor by Howard Marks 

A Random Walk Down Wallstreet by Burton Malkiel (the book I personally started with. A great book on fallacies in investing. I used to have it at the top, but it has some slight flaws and Bogles work is simply better and more modern) 

The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham
(A snap must-read, however not a good place to start. Mr. Market can be dry and hard to follow for the newbies.) 

The Warren Buffet Way by Robert Hagstrom
(A great book if you want a modern view on traditional ideas, as well as a focus on Buffet) 

 Security Analysis by Ben Graham
 (A textbook but a great one. Read this one if you start to understand but still can't answer the question ""how to people set price targets or valuate companies"") 

Last but not least, I'd get through all of Warren Buffets shareholder letters written for the Birkshire shareholders. It's insightful and gives great insight on what matters when looking at companies according to one of the greatest men of all time. 

Not a book, however a great place to read is investiopedia. Quality, unbiased and factual articles explaining terms and concepts. Grest place to learn.

Good luck!"
2019-04-16 03:03:53,"I'd recommend Clark Howard's guides for first time investors at https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/investing-retirement/beginning-investors/ 

Near the bottom is a link for intermediate and advanced investors. Clark will nearly always give advice strictly for investing for retirement, not day trading, but IMO it's the best place to start anyway. Learn what you can about why he gives each part of his advice and then you'll know what terms to look up on Google or Investopedia or other site. 

At your age, I'd start looking into investing in a Roth IRA. Careful though, they have quite a number of limitations since they are retirement funds that you won't have to pay taxes on any gains. 

Good luck!"

2019-10-23 21:36:12,"The catch is that they're they're high yield bond funds, in other words debt from poorly rated companies.

When the economy is doing good, and risky companies need to borrow money, the can do so, except they have to pay far more than more credit worthy companies do. Which could be a good investment. Except, if the economy tanks, those companies that were already on such shaky ground that they had to borrow at 6%, 7%, 8%, they're far more likely to default on their obligations.

Bondholders will still fare better than stock holders, but still. They are risky investments - don't even think of them as ""bonds"" in the traditional sense of ""safe, boring, stable"" investments. They might appear that way now and for the last 8 or so years, but there is risk associated with them.

Mid october they just initiated a no testing period, launch collab with Buffalo Grill, another big chain restaurant (360) based in France, that SPECIALISES on Grilled Meat. How bold is that, BYND?

First time that I tasted the burger, but their 'meat' was amazing to me! Full of flavour! Though the waitress told me that she had mixed feelings about it so to each their own.

But if Les Echos is honest in their article, vegan and vegetarian revenue in France is soaring while representing only up to 2% of the population (imo french aren't truly vegetarian), and tourism is huge in France so.... upside?

Yeah it might be bad but let's see that ER first.

It looks like they're spending a lot on collaborations which is normal in order to grow and thrive

If they gave a good ER, the only thing that will hurt them is NOT competition BUT a bad economical downturn, and a near one, because they are growing and it's expensive...

2019-10-23 16:48:11,"Oh okay, yeah I think OKTA will be fine in the long term. Not a fan of quick trading like that but to each his own. I'm a dividend growth investor with some riskier cloud stuff in there as well."
2019-10-23 16:46:16,"&gt;Is the earnings the dividend you'll receive if you own the stock?

No. Earnings is what the company earned. Dividend is set completely separately.  Dividends can and sometimes are more than the companies earnings, but this is not sustainable.

&gt;What if it's negative?  You just lose money?

It means the company lost money.  This will often times mean the stock price will go down and that would be like you losing money, but not if the shares were already priced expecting a negative earnings report.

&gt;Also, what is the actual call vs the report?

The call would be a discussion about the earnings report.  The report is the official numbers."
2019-10-23 16:45:41,"so buy puts? also earnings on Monday, sell puts beforehand or buy more?"
2019-10-23 16:44:02,Which is unfortunate bc those are enterprise cloud companies and WeWork is a REIT
2019-10-23 16:43:48,I can’t tell you exact numbers cuz I can’t remember but i started to get into swing trading and I can make 4-10 dollars a day.
2019-10-23 16:43:11,I bought one share of okta and then used the rest for other stocks. I didn’t want to pile all of my money into one stock in case it came down and I was right xD. The only thing is I was down like $20 and I had no idea what I was doing so I made good trades and some more bad trades.
2019-10-23 16:41:23,Let me know when you find out
2019-10-23 16:40:03,"Correct, WeWork was the icing on the cake that continued the drop."
2019-10-23 16:39:24,How many of what did you buy for only $350 if I may ask?
2019-10-23 16:37:18,Boca burgers are nasty IMHO.  I am a fan of Dr Prager's bean based burgers though.  Several others are good as well.  Never understood Beyond Meat as there were always good meat substitutes and what it the barrier to entry?  Extruded patties are an old technology.  Recipe's are not copyrightable.

2019-10-23 16:25:54,Yea I just got into investing over the summer and bought it then. I only have 350 in my acc so the drop that happened next really took a toll on my portfolio lol
2019-10-23 16:23:26,That’s exactly how I feel about Impossible Burgers—the beefy flavor is kinda the whole appeal. I’ll have to give Beyond another try.
2019-10-23 16:10:25,"I'm not a vegetarian but I do eat meat substitute products from time to time. Beyond Burgers definitely seem like a big step up compared to Boca, Morningstar, etc. but yeah I think most of the success is from buzz and getting them stocked next to the ground beef instead of the vegetarian section of the frozen aisle or next to the tofu. The price being so much higher than beef and with no significant difference on the nutrition label means I'm unlikely to buy them again now that curiosity has been satisfied. I'd assume it's the same for a lot of people that initially tried it either at home or at whatever fast food chain."
2019-10-23 16:06:45,Where is the demand coming from?
2019-10-23 16:02:58,I’m a vegetarian and appreciate Beyond Meat because it tastes like meat. I miss sausage and hamburgers. But health and future generations are far more important than my desire for a particular flavor/texture. It’s a nice substitute.
2019-10-23 15:58:27,I'm not sure as well.  Vegetarians I have spoken to are not a fan because it tastes like meat.  I'm a meat eater and I enjoy it because it tastes like meat.  I don't see them dong well long term.
2019-10-23 15:55:56,"More expensive than the real deal, people who would pay more to not eat meat at a fast food joint, probably don't eat at fast food joints. Also Beyond Meat patties at my grocery store are on sale, 8 bucks for 2 patties, or I could pick up twice as much real meat for half the price."
2019-10-23 15:48:40,"Speaking as a vegetarian consumer the exuberance for Beyond Meat has never made an ounce of sense. Veggie burgers (and ""chickin"" etc) have been around forever. As far as I can tell Beyond Meat is just Morningstar Farms with a marketing department. Whereas Impossible Foods, with their crazy engineered hemoglobin yeast, have some actual technology and an interesting / new product.

Can anyone expound on what is the novelty/value of Beyond Meat?"
2019-10-23 15:32:32,Ridiculous growth prospects were priced in. It’s still way too overpriced I’m afraid.

The people who don't constitute a strong portion of the capital flows lost their capital.  Those that do, did not. Just because we are at whatever double digit unemployment doesn't necessarily have as pronounced an effect if it only accounts for a small marginal portion of the demand.

Also, I know at least some investors who believe that covid-19 will cause many governments to re-think just-in-time global supply chains, and so they are in part betting that there will be significant government subsidies over the next few years with the goal of boosting domestic manufacturing industry. This will be good for large incumbents, who constitute the greatest share of value-weighted indices."
2020-04-30 22:02:59,Ah! The fed is the most obvious culprit here. But are they the only one? 🤨

2020-04-30 21:56:36,"For me I like to see shares sliding a bit get bought up by insiders. It's more of a red flag to me for companies sliding that maybe it's sliding for a reason when they don't buy. 

For me the insider selling is a bit more useful in the sense that I interpret it as a good time to sell. That's just a tiny bit of information that has no major impact on my decision. 

Say I were to own CMG. I see there's insider selling and they are not too far off their February highs. Combine that with a bearish stance on the market I currently have, I'd definitely be looking to sell CMG and take some profit.

That's pretty much all I look at it for. And that being said, I've never actually sold off that info either. But I'm not into anything as volatile as Tesla or CMG where I could lose hundreds in any given day. 

So TLDR: I have no fucking clue what it's used for hahaha"
2020-04-30 21:56:15,"Ya I hear ya. We all know this is a farse, just trying to maneuver it as best we can.

It’s a risk and I’m pretty new to investing but I believe this could be a game changer if the 20 patient trial goes well and I want to be in early. I’m in for the long haul on this and I put in my DD. I’m willing to lose big for the chance to gain big on this but I know not everyone agrees with that approach. Yesterday and today were for the day/swing traders looking to make a quick profit. Most people still in I’m assuming believe there’s relative long term growth potential.

2020-04-30 20:39:37,"The option selling strategy you propose is selling strangles. As far as I can tell, they way you propose doing it has no connection to the underlying. If you would normally sell strangles on the underlying, go for it. I would say that your plan of placing orders if the underlying passes your strikes is risky though. If the underlying hits your call strike, you buy 100 shares and then it drops, you've just lost money. And now you have 200 shares. Same thing on the put side.

The more common approach to your situation is to sell covered calls. If you bought at 55 and the underlying is at 50, sell calls at 55 and repeat until called away or you've recovered your loss."

It currently isn't a great form of medium of exchange because or its transaction costs, and volatility, but it is a great store of value because the supply is mathmatically fixed, and scarcity into the future is known, among other reasons.

In the same way that Gold and cash aren't perfect, but through certain infrastructures many of these systems are solved (cc processors, or 3rd party custodians) sp too will BTC develop an infrastructure that can stabilize it (like the lightning network), but ultimately it is designed to be a deflationary asset. And like gold, will always be rising in value in the long run.

1. Yes the industry will recover, but what ""recovery"" looks like is debatable in the post COVID world
2. Timeframe uncertain, other high growth sectors available to park money, the ETF JETS (tracking global jets index) is up 30% in last 6 months, slightly better than SPY but trails QQQ.

I do think there will be bounces along the way with things like industry stimulus etc once congress get their act together, but overall I don't believe this is a good sector if your goal is growth"

Take CCL. It's an attractive price, but they're burning through cash like crazy. What if the second wave (or third wave) of COVID is even larger than the first? What if 2021 is a repeat of 2020?

It seems likely that they're going to be quite affordable through AT LEAST Q2 next year. I'd rather pay a bit more for a sure thing then risk it all IMO."

It was my first time trading outside of straight buying index funds and although maybe NIO will continue to go up I'm pretty psyched to have nabbed a couple months worth of living expenses in just a couple weeks. That's better than I imagined for my first active trading experience.

2021-05-16 13:23:54,"Yeah EVs got slaughtered, but you have to look at some of the reasons/possible reasons:

1. Speculation vs recovery stocks.  Energy was a major laggard not long ago, but the conditions are ripe for the market to want to see huge gains on commodities amongst other plays which are safer than spec/growth with inflation.  A lot of stocks that have been hot are cyclical, however, and if anything, the gas shortage only illustrates a growing need for EVs.

2.  Traditional manufacturers stepping their EV game up.  This is a genuine concern, but it definitely also means to invest in companies with a solid bull case.  Tesla made it through the fire and cheap valuations, so did NIO, so it’s really just a matter of finding quality.  They more than likely won’t all be winners.

The options part you can’t take back.  I was similarly optimistic about the EV dip only to see it dip further and further, but thankfully I’m not in the options game.  Shares will take patience, but there is still enormous upside for any of these companies that actually make it through.  Call is yours, but with anything where the stock’s valuation doesn’t line up with what the stock should be worth, I would hold."

2021-05-16 12:46:14,"Well done.
Haven't verified the reports myself, but studies show that people in general are not rewarded for taking risk. Higher risk generally means you'll do worse than average. Coupled with the belief that we are all above average in everything we do, perhaps pennystocks and speculative plays are not for everyone? High risk and hubris is generally bad news for any investor. You generally see and remember the plays that turn out well, but that's not an accurate representation.

If what you're doing isn't working, try something else. Less risk, learn valuation, check out different investing strategies and see what suits you.
Oh, and also, check if it's all you or an unfortunate combination of you + timing :) 

Best of luck!"

2021-11-22 17:04:56,"I would argue that the majority of people don't buy soup with PayPal either. PayPal's dominance is in the retail online space. I think there is a real risk of market share loss for PayPal as crypto moves from industry adoption to retail consumer adoption. No one knows what that time horizon is (although I think it's closer than others seem to) for this. But, if the intent is to invest in PayPal, I think it's worth discussing how far away we actually think crypto is from consumer-level adoption. 

As for stability, I agree. Stability is a huge hindrance to the actual use case for crypto on a consumer level. Up to this point, the locations that have seen the highest consumer use case for crypto are areas where inflation has created more instability than using crypto.

I personally think major/global crypto adoption for consumer use will first come through pre-existing companies which would bode well for PayPal. The spot where I think we might see this the most in the near future is Visa's already developed API for cryptography. I would assume PayPal is already looking into doing the same thing."

But people usually use likes of GM, F, or TM to show how TSLA is ""overvalued"".   It is obvious that TSLA EV market share will decline, but total car market share will continue to grow exponentially for years to come and will stabilize only after the majority EV adoption. And, yes, TSLA is not ONLY a car company. This reminds me how people ridiculed Amazon valuation at 30B, and used to point out that it is more than other bookstore chains valuation combined. And Amazon would need to sell all the books in the world to justify that ridiculous 30B valuation."

2021-11-22 15:58:42,"I am heavily invested in digital assets and payment stocks like PayPal and square.

The biggest problem with PayPal is that, from where I can see, blockchain payment would eliminate any need for PayPal.
Sort of like the remittance market will be destroyed within 10 years imo.

There are a few advantages still for traditional finance. One is dealing with fiat, another is you can deal with scams and get your money back.

But none of those really need PayPal, it needs banks and credit card company.

Of cause, this isn't saying PayPal won't adapt or this would happen within a short time, but I am actually quite bearish.

Look at what can be possible with lightning tech.
This is already working but opened to limited countries.

2021-11-22 15:42:54," I don't think a long time is accurate from the stand point of investing. The market is forward thinking. Many of the Layer 2 protocols for ERC-20 (Ethereum) as well as other very low transaction cost blockchains (Algorand, Solana, etc.) are already seeing adoption in market sectors and/or will be rolling out in the coming quarters. 

Many of these blockchains are still small players when we look at the whole but the scalability is already there for most (if not all) of them! It's really just continued adoption from more companies that will be holding back crypto in the near future. 

As for PayPal offering crypto, it only has 4 options Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash (in a centralized PayPal wallet). If I was an investor in crypto as an industry, I would want an exchange that offers more then just 4 options. If I were to be using a centralized exchange then the trust of using a legacy company like PayPal is the one benefit I personally see. So, I don't really see their current crypto strategy as relevant. That said, if PayPal announces that they will be competing as an exchange with more tokens or will be creating their own centralized swap/paypal based payment on X blockchain... then I really do think their already large user base will allow them to catch up in the space. It's really a question of are they already building out their blockchain platform/exchange?"

2022-05-31 21:18:35,"If you sold all your Tesla shares right now and put them in a safer investment that yielded a 10% return each year, the sum would be worth a million dollars before you're 50. That money alone would enable you to retire 15-20 years before most of your peers.

You have enough investment money already that you can invest it conservatively and still be set for life.

On the other hand, if you don't sell it and Tesla stock drops down to where it was from its inception up until 2020, even the highest values from that time, then you're SOL. Your entire investment would be worth $20K at most.

I got in at 50 and out at 750. Tesla is a great company it's just priced for unusually high growth. If it doesn't grow at roughly 30% or more then your returns will be less than the market. Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Do the math on the revenue and profit growth. Lots of stock valuation videos on YouTube.  The guy from the channel named ""invested"" just did a good valuation video last week. If you are ok with the risk/reward then hang on, if not then dump them. Many value investors recommend more concentrated portfolios as opposed to blind investing but typically only when they really understand the investment opportunity and ideally have a small downside. Tesla definitely has a big down side if it doesnt keep up the growth rates."

2022-05-31 21:04:29,"The only way that Tesla's valuation makes sense is if they release L5 FSD for realsies.

If they do then I buy the argument that Tesla is as much a software company as it is a car manufacturer. They can earn high margin recurring revenue with a massive moat.

If they don't then you own a luxury car company worth more than almost all other car companies combined that produces like 1% of cars on the road. You will get absolutely rekt.

2022-05-31 21:02:06,"Depends on lots of things. What is your net worth? How much of Tesla is that net worth? Any investment advisor will say a diversified portfolio is best for consistent growth while limiting downside risk. 

Yes you are 29 and it seems like a solid runway ahead but in 2008 the recession lasted many years and blink, now your 39. 

But back to your question. Tesla is not going away anytime soon but the growth will slow as other catch up. What you really risk is missing on growth in other companies while taking single company risk. 

In 2050, a million bucks will be starting salary for professionals. So think higher….

Oh, and if you get married, risk appetite will probably go down.

2022-05-31 20:41:18,"And so what man? I know all this and know even worse market mechanics, you know about entropy and variance swaps they have on GME that make them a ton of money each time GME runs when they're forced to cover FTD exposure from ETFs, or their quarterly futures roll over.

First statement, go buy level 2 data. You'll see the order book, you're not getting the worst deal, you're getting the deal that had actual liquidity available. If you're going to buy 100k GME shares your kinda deserve to get the worst deal if you just use a market order and not a limit order.

Second, yeah that's they're job. They're legal requirement as a market maker to make liquidity. And in cases other than GameStop it benefits investors. Prevents aggressive pullbacks from panic selling etc.

Third, ETF abuse is a problem but some investor long on SPX wouldn't be affected by it because well hedge funds and instructions want SPX to go up and it will. And SPX is so liquid there's no point doing it. Plus if SPX goed to zero they will only double their money. Suicidal play to do long term. It doesn't affect long term investors. Also you realise Games price action is controlled by Delta hedging of options. And the reason we went down today is because there's a large put position. Not a direct short attack?

4, other than this being a borderline conspiracy. The brokers best interest is usually the markets best interest and therefore a long term diversified investors best interest. You'll need to provide evidence of brokers all collaborating and manipulating votes significantly.

Payment for order flow? Doesnt affect the economy, and the long term investors in it. Only affects margin swing traders, and requires a significant amount of resources to abuse.

They lend out stuff using your position as a hedge but don't actually lend out your position directly. What about the fact that BlackRock and other companies lend out huge amount of shares or make available. Those are theirs and not retail.

The swap position still can be accessed by the SEC, yeah it sucks retail can't see it, but it also prevents institutions fighting each other and retail getting caught in-between. Again this doesn't affect a classical long term investors either.

So again, how does this affect a investor that buys SPX, VT, VUG or VTI. Or even better how does this affect retail that follow the hedgefunds agenda and go long on what they go long on."

2013-04-17 13:53:25,"&gt; Personally, I don't like to count on house values rising (it being ""cheap"")

Yeah I'm not counting on making money from the rise, being able to rent is the big advantage.  If I'm pulling rent and the value just keeps up with inflation I'd be very happy.

What I meant by cheap wasn't that they were undervalued, just that they weren't overvalued and were unlikely to fall much more.  "
2013-04-17 13:48:31,"Personally, I don't like to count on house values rising (it being ""cheap""), but house prices right now compared to rent in my region makes plenty of sense.  If you can get a 12% ROI before expenses (rent a 100k house for 1k a month), then leverage it with a 4% loan (say for 80k), you have some very nice looking margins."
2013-04-17 13:46:52,"Number of reasons.

The top reason being rate of return.

I feel current valuations will remain stable.  I don't know if we are on a bottom or the start of a new bubble, but I don't expect housing prices- at least in my market- to drop significantly enough to *hurt me*.

My income will be based off of *rent* and my monthly cost.  If I get the house at the right price, I don't care what happens to the value of the house; if the value of the house drops 10% but my income remains the same, I shrug and keep depositing my rent checks.

If the value of the house rises 50% or more, but rents don't rise 50% or more, then I sell it and reinvest the money in another source that gives me a better rate of return.

The second reason being that real estate is one of the few big markets in which you can actually buy something under its value with good searching and negotiating skills.

If a house flipper can consistently spend $80k cash to buy and fix up a crappy place and sell it for $100k, then I can spend $80k cash to buy and fix up a crappy place and rent it like a $100k place.  Depending on how you want to look at it, I'm either beating market returns significantly with my 80k, or getting an instant 20% return on my investment and then making regular market returns off of that.

Third reason is that I've come up with some particularly clever methods of financing working with private lenders.

Basically, I don't think I can beat these returns elsewhere."

2013-04-15 19:10:13,"Hi eyeTrade,
Thanks for your interest.
I hold a constant long UPRO position, selling chunks on market highs and buying chunks on market lows. My complete portfolio and methodology is published there on HSM and updated twice a week.

The only thing that changed from the Sunday update was I rolled the 2 SPY APR 157 contracts to May 160 this morning before going to work when the Dow was down 70pts. Note, these 2 contracts are whats left of a 4 contract position that I sold 2 to pay off the remaining 2 (i.e.,there free contracts to let ride) 

Come Wed I will do a mid-week update (most of the time I get around to it) here:
http://www.hotstockmarket.com/t/258962/weekday-late-night-charts-and-analysis/20#post_2949130

Black Swan events happen and a position swing trader like myself is fully prepared for it. Of course, there is always hindsight that says if I knew I would of sold more earlier and I would of liked to get to 1610 where I had planned to let another chunk of UPRO go but that's the way it goes.

As it stands, I have to look to the technicals for signs of stopping volume where price looks to be putting in a foothold before deciding anything.
Most of the time anything under a 5% pullback gets no reaction from me other than short-term options. I will wait for at least 8% or more to reload on UPRO lots.
Truth be told, I'm glad for the sell-off and I hope it pulls back a lot more. I was down to splitting lots of UPRO for sale as my position was significantly shrinking on the nose bleeding highs of the S&amp;P.
Corrections are healthy for the market as well as for my style of trading."

2013-04-15 12:56:01,"The velocity of money is a fancy and confusing word. According to the quantity theory of money MV = PQ. P is price, M is money supply, V is velocity, and Q is quantity of goods sold at the price.

IMO the most valuable form of the quantity theory of money is where velocity is removed from the equation. It hides inside the equation for GDP. And we say M/GDP = P. 

So if money supply goes up 10% and GDP goes down 1% then we have 11% inflation. If GDP goes up 10% and money supply goes up 10% then we have 0% inflation.

When people pay down debt, when debt is money, then money disappears. It needs to be re-lent out for that money to reappear. The market knows no difference between ""real money"" and ""lent money"". So when lent money decreases, so does demand, and prices. 

When A bank forecloses, they sell the house and pay down the debt - money disappeared. When a business is doing so good that they start paying down their debt, deflation happens again. When a government loses credit rating, their borrowing slows down and deflation happens again. When a consumer has all his credit cards maxed out - currency stops being created. 

When interest rates are low...more debt is created across the board, and so money supply increases. 

Inversely, when a depositor takes out cash from his bank the bank must sell assets to give him his money because they don't actually hold any of it. They need to stay within their reserve ratio, which may be a 10:1 ratio from lent money to deposits. 

Banks are necessarily insolvent in this system, and it's an extremely delicate system that I don't condone at all. And Im not surprised you know nothing about it, because no one does. You sound like a lunatic if you say that banks are insolvent and they are licensed counterfeiters. "
2013-04-15 12:24:57,"This is interesting... I have to think about this for a little bit.  I apologize but can you elaborate on the last point?  My general theory that I've been working with is that the key to inflation is velocity (which is why we haven't seen it yet).  This has led me to believe that at the root of velocity is the banking system and fueled by debt rehypothecation.  So basically what I am saying is that I think if banking heats up (aka they started ""irresponsibly"" loaning again) we will get really nasty inflation but a near term stronger economy. Not sure where I'm exactly headed with this.  Am I explaining a similar phenomenon to what you are referring to that the mortgage crisis killed velocity therefore leading to deflation and the Fed is printing to keep the money supply going?"
2013-04-15 12:13:04,"Here's a post I made in ELI5 about why:

""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier

The reason the bank wants your money, is because they can turn around and loan it out. They lend your money to someone who's buying a house, or using a credit card, or investing in a business venture. The receiver of that loan then spends the money.
Somewhere along this timeline is when money is created. Because once that loaned money is spent, the money is then put into another bank where it is lent out again. And again.
They keep track of the amount of ""real money"" or the monetary base. 

http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE

And the amount of total actual money, or MZM.

http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZM""

So really, the mortgage crisis created deflation. Notice that gold didn't skyrocket until after QE1."
2013-04-15 12:09:25,I feel like I'm having a brain fart... but how could the money supply growth rate be slowing in an environment where they are printing money.  Sequester?
2013-04-15 11:56:22,"Yes usually.  But I don't feel like that's going to happen here because the market is so bottomed out.  The real estate has an intrinsic value much higher than what would be dictated, so the prices won't fall as much.  As in: No matter how much bond rates rise, people aren't going to start selling their house for 40k.  At that point it's more valuable to keep it and live there.  

It's kind of an edge effect.  "

2013-04-15 01:08:52,"Study options. Do high probability trades. For example, learn what delta is. It is also a gauge of probability. This is why an At-the-money option (stock is trading at the strike price) is always a .50 delta. It has a 50% probability of expiring in-the-money and a 50% probability of expiring out-the-money. The further in the money the higher the delta and the better chance you have of making money when **buying** options. Now selling you want the opposite. You want to sell the low probability delta. You want them to expire worthless. Sell OTM.  Also, if you like a stock and are willing to buy it at $x amount, think about selling a put instead. You collect premium and if the stock drops you end up with the stock at the strike price you sold minus the premium you gained. If it goes up you made your premium and can go find the next stock. Only do this on a stock you are willing to own. "

"
2013-10-23 17:14:53,"No. eTrade is a broker.  eTrade charges $9.99 commission per trade.
So if you buy $1000 of stock, they'll deduct $1009.99 from your account. 

Then if you sell it later for $1500, they'll add $1490.01 (1500 - 9.99) into your account. 

Your total gains were $480.02 (1490.01 - 1009.99).  You'll report that on your tax return. If you held it more than a year you'll pay 20% taxes, so $96 (480 * .2) will be deducted from your tax return.

&gt;The rules adopt a new term ""pattern day trader,"" which includes any margin customer that day trades (buys then sells or sells short then buys **the same security on the same day**) four or more times in five business days, provided the number of day trades are more than six percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day period. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that the customer day trades. The required minimum equity must be in the account prior to any day-trading activities. If the account falls below the $25,000 requirement, the pattern day trader will not be permitted to day trade until the account is restored to the $25,000 minimum equity level."

You evolve over time.

Your strategies, preferred vehicles, trading style, they will all change and grow with you.

&gt;Now I'm the first to admit that my technical analysis isn't all that great to begin with but what I do need to learn is how to factor in the news.

Maybe that is the problem, ignore the news, trade on what you see. The price is truth.

Unless you are trying to trade earning releases ahead of time, eg shorting AMZN now ahead of earnings, then news should not be a big factor in your trading.

By trading on news, you are being reactive, not proactive.

The best traders I know take positions ahead of news events, not after."
2013-10-23 11:17:24,"You generally pay a flat commission to the brokerage for each trade you make (buy or sell).  There are some exceptions such as buying into a mutual fund directly from the company that manages the fund (buying a Vanguard fund directly from Vanguard), or when contributing to an IRA or 401k plan.  Also some brokerages have a list of no-commission ETFs you can buy.

Mutual funds and ETFs have an ""expense ratio"" which is a percentage that the company that manages the fund will take annually to pay themselves.  Some mutual funds also have a ""load"" which is a percentage that you pay upfront when you buy into the fund, but it's generally recommended to only buy no-load funds. 

You pay taxes on the capital gains (profits) you make from a sale, and the dividends that your stocks/funds paid you.  You report all this on your tax return and it affects your tax return/bill.  You pay a smaller percent on stocks/funds you hold for more than a year.

2013-10-22 21:51:07,"Buying one call contract gives you the ""option"" to CALL 100 shares of underlying INTO your account at the option's strike price, you pay $""strike price"" per share. Buying a put contract gives you the ""option"" to PUT 100 shares you own into someone's account, making them buy the shares from you at the put options strike price. 

Say you sell one GOOG 1050 call that expires months from now. GOOG is currently at $1007. You'll get a credit. If GOOG rises to say 1080 within a few days, your short 1050 call could be exercised. It WILL automatically be exercised ON its expiration date months from now if it's above 1050. If it is, you're on the hook to provide 100 shares of GOOG to the person who bought your call, they in turn will give you $1050 per share. 

However you get the shares, if you had them to begin with or if you have to buy them at current market value, $1080, you'll need to come up with them no matter what. 

The best way to protect yourself is to buy a call, say a 1055 GOOG call, that way you can exercise it when GOOG is at 1080, pay $1055 per share, then give the shares to the other guy. Loosing $5 x 100 in the process.

Selling a 1050 call and buying a 1055 call at the same time obviously leaves you with a credit, much smaller than the credit you would receive if you had only sold the call. It's actually a percentage of the max loss, could be 10 to 40% (avg) and this is where IV comes in. Higher IV, higher options prices. But if GOOG stays around 1000 for the next few months, you will get to keep that small credit. This trade I just described is what's known as a bearish call spread, one of the two legs of the IC."

One option contact covers 100 shares. 50 contracts covers 5000 shares. 5000 shares of nflx costs  quite a lot more than simply going long options to cover your short options."

2013-10-22 19:45:38,"Trading options is more complex than trading binary instruments (stocks, fx, futures, etc) as there are a lot more moving parts. Options are like ternary instruments, they allow one to profit if the underlying goes up, down, or sideways. Best way to get started is to learn what a put and a call are. Then move onto basic positions. The best approach I can recommend is to pickup a beginners book. I read [this](http://www.amazon.com/Options-Beginner-Beyond-Opportunities-Minimize/dp/0132655683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382484663&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=options) - the first version - which taught me the ropes quickly. I also picked up several other books afterwards that got into the subject on a deeper and more technical level. One of the most fascinating things I've learned so far is what implied volatility is. See [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1l76vw/option_trading/cbwkok9). With IV you can work out statistically the chances of a trade profiting. Like someone else mentioned, www.tastytrade.com, a free streaming live options talk show, is based on statistical trading and not trading on fear/hope.

  Traditionally, iron condors are traded with index ETF options such as the SPY or IWM. There's obviously less risk of a massive move in a short amount of time. Though black swans do exist, see 2008, euro crisis, debt ceiling, etc. If the s&amp;p or the russel stays in your IC's range until it expires, you win. You profit on theta decay this way. Since ICs are short volatility, there was a huge drop in NFLX implied vol today -went from 70sh to 50sh. That 20 some odd point drop in IV alone amounted to over 50% of $4800. The rest was from theta decay and delta."

2013-10-22 18:02:03,Yeah options are risky but rewarding as well and I prefer them because you only need a little bit of capital to trade and use option spreads to limit risk to make buying option contracts cheaper(but also limit profits). I highly recommend watching Tastytrade's videos on YouTube to learn and downloading Thinkorswim's papermoney app to practice trading them.

Still glad I closed it since it is going lower in the post-market.  

In my journalling I noted, high IV is literally intoxicating when you are a habitual option seller, but like most intoxicants it can lead you to do some reckless things."
2013-10-22 17:38:21,"An option in it's simplest term, a contract to buy or sell 100 shares of stock for a certain price(strike price) at or before a certain date.

The reason it's so big is that there's 50 option contracts in the trade; If you do a 1 contract trade, then you'd be risking $400 to make $100 but in most cases you can actually make a trade where you risk $50/100/200 to make $50/100/200. There's actually a ton I could explain about options but: 1. it would take me forever and 2. someone out there could explain much better than I can.

I can narrow it down to this strategy, which is selling an Iron Condor. You basically sell two vertical spreads, collect money right away(since you're selling options), and by this method you want the stock to be within a certain range when the contracts expire(in this case, Saturday/Friday after close) in order to keep that money(called premium). The reason why this trade is looking at a big loss is that Netflix is getting destroyed so there's a chance for it to go below $275 before the contracts expire."

GLW is fairly valued here at $14, there are some buy side analysts out there with targets in the $20 area, but who knows when that will happen.

If things are going well at GLW (he should know how business is going), then it could be worth it to hang onto the shares, collect that 2% dividend and see how it goes.

If this is a big chunk of money, he may want to consult with an investment adviser.

If this is an option which allows him to buy the stock at $1.57 and sell them at current market price, he basically has to make that transaction before August. He can go long on GLW stock, or he can sell it.

Even if you do not make it in the long run, the different things you can learn from the traders will be of great benefit.

Another friend of mine was trading safe, making small consistent gains, but the shop was not satisfied with his go slow approach. He was not scalping enough intra-day or getting the rapid returns they wanted. He was basically forced out even though he was in the green.

At the end, even if you fail, you get a lot of experience you can put towards your own trading when you have enough money to do it on your own.

2012-06-27 15:59:08,"Sure, college courses teach 0 technical analysis so a lot of what I learned was self taught. Read a lot of William Oneil and Jesse Livermore. Very basic formation and pattern recognition (Cup and Handle Formations, Ascending and Descending Trendlines, Consolidation patterns, etc). 
The broker I ended up working for pretty much one upped everything I taught myself. He taught me how to read volume, setup efficient scans, how MM and institutions influence the openings and closings, basic options setups (still don't trade options), Fibonacci retracement, RSI, etc.

I'm still pretty novice at TA, but definitely improved. I made about 7% of my base salary last year (with only 15k and staying within PTD guidlines!). I dont do it for the money, I just really didn't want to lose what I learned. "

2012-06-27 11:55:19,Not sure what your asking me and how signal to noise ratios are really relevant here.  Care to explain?  The pricing is down because the stock is trying to breakdown out of support.  Also those option prices were taken mid day when the stock was about 30 cents higher.  
2012-06-27 11:31:19,"&gt;Yes I'm definitely going to keep watching the stock for a good entry, although in a couple years I don't think it'll matter too much.

You're right. I was looking at the trade from a short-term perspective, as I have no reason to believe that NBG is undervalued right now. 

&gt; can you share what it's like to trade full-time? 

It's different for everyone. Personally, I focus on short-term trades (several minutes to 2-3 days max.). 

I could probably write a small book about my experiences so far... it's like a neverending rollercoaster ride, always ups and downs. I love it, because I learn something every day, be it about the market or myself. There's the analytical side to trading (set-ups, technical/fundamental analysis, money &amp; risk management,...) which I see as my strength. Then there's the psychological side (sticking to plans, emotional detachment from trades,...) which is my weakness.

So right now, I'm working on my weaknesses. I have to be brutally honest to myself, which can be very very hard. For example, today I know my mindset is not right for trading. This has cost me a lot in the past, so now I force myself to stay on the sidelines and watch.

Overall, I found it to be much more work than I though it would be when starting out. I'm definitely putting in more hours than I did at my previous full-time job - but it really doesn't feel like work to me. I love doing it, probably because I've always loved maths, statistics, computers and psychology.

&gt; Is trading the stock market your sole income?

I would love to be able to say that I'm consistenly profitable... unfortunately that would be a lie. Right now I still have to supplement my income from trading with savings set aside for this purpose. Once these run out, I will have to take on a part-time job - but I'm working hard to make sure that I won't have to do this.

I took on a huge risk when I started trading full-time. You definitely shouldn't do that unless you've already proven that you can be consistently profitable or your financial situation allows you to take this risk.

2012-06-26 20:58:39,"Some TA is actually at the edge of fundamental analysis, only with respect to price movement rather than simply price level. 

When a bear trend is in motion people become more and more inclined to sell the lower it goes, vice versa for bull trends. This psychology can get more complicated if you look deeper. Take for example the cup and handle. A security rounds down, bottoms out, then rises back up to it's previous high for days or weeks, then the prediction is that it will break out eventually. During the round down, you have a typical bear trend where people want to stop losing money in the bear market. At the same time people start covering and buying in as it get's cheap for it's fundamentals. Then you have a typical bull market in the rounding up phase. This is where it gets really technical. When it hits previous highs the low-buyers start taking profits and getting skittish that it wont pass previous highs yet. The ones who never got out at previous highs are more inclined to take their profits than risk that roller coaster again. Keeping it around that previous high for a short while. After it's hung around there for a while it becomes more and more apparent that it's not going to fall, so the sellers stop selling and a new bull market is started.

I think magic is a complete misunderstanding of what it is, it's simply the mechanics of greed and maybe some game theory in combination with a variety of different buyers and sellers who happened to get in or out at certain prices, which in the end results in some typical patterns forming in the price finding process."

Truth be told, when bearish headlines start coming out saying the stock should be dropping 50%, that is usually a sign that the bottom in near. Same goes for the upside, when you see the main stream media start telling you AAPL should be at $1500 next month and everybody agrees, its time to get the hell out!

Im not saying this is the bottom for FB, but when you get major slams from places like Barrons, its a great time to stress test the longs and see at what point they simply become unwilling to sell. This creates a floor on the stock that is good to use as a stop loss level if you go long. At the moment the $20 level is holding, lets see how it does when the market  goes south.

2012-09-21 00:39:50,"I think the bigger issue is the shift from one generation to another. Things were design to be interchangeable, consumers can maintain it themselves. To being built more to a cost, and space efficiency. Most computers/electronics today are so hard to work on you might as well have a degree in electrical engineering, of course this is just exaggerating, but you get the point. 

Desktop computers are a slowing industry, not doubt, but dying? I don't think so. It's gone from a consumer dependent product to being really just an industry dependent only product.
Families and small businesses can get by with a notebook, a tablet, etc. Industries can't. 

However, tt doesn't help that if your business is large enough it is much more efficient for many of the applications to be centralized or on a cloud to some sense. My company, I operate through multiple centralized servers and my employees can operate on a dummy client. The dummy client doesn't have to feature a high end processor, large ram, large hard drive capacity. We're fine with older Core 2 Duos with 2GB of ram and a 240GB hard drive (2x120GB on onboard RAID0+1), the processor and memory provides plenty of head room to keep the PC running smoothly. All of them were built to a cost, I don't believe each one cost more than 400 bucks. Almost none of the applications run off the terminal itself but rather the servers. Servers take care of firewalls, anti-virus, Intuit products, MS Office, etc. It almost defeats the purpose of upgrading, normally when a company upgrades their 3 year warranty has expired. Being a handy tech guy growing up, it helps to be not too dependent on warranties. 

PC manufactures are not worth investing in, but it's still a needed industry. "

On the flip side, there are people out there buying guns thinking that there might be laws which would regulate future sales of weapons.

I'm sure with the hysteria about gun laws forcing the demand for firearms up, there will be some bigs profits posted by swhc and the likes.

2012-12-17 18:11:16,"Yea. That's what I mean.  To me, one year is more than a few months. 

 Also I feel Colorado's personal home-growing market could be a bigger cash-cow for growing supply stores than the big warehouse grows, because of the efficacy of scale works against the little DIY personal use guys.  Smaller grow lights can cost more than the larger industrial ones because more units of the big ones get made.  This means that a small closet grow Op' can need almost as big of a cash investment to do it right, as a full bedroom grow does,  (and as stated any new big players won't even be expected to be joining the party in Colorado for a year.)

   They say the the guys selling pick axes to the prospectors were the real winners of the gold-rush. I predict a similar outcome with legalization; the price of finished cannabis should drop precipitously, but the price of growing supplies should stay a little more stable as that facet of the new legal market expands exponentially.  

For example: the price of pro-biotic friendly soil bacteria and fungus is outrageously expensive at the hydro stores, it's great stuff, but buying good soil fungus and bacteria to help with growing healthy cannabis plants can cost as much or more per gram than the finished top-self MMJs themselves sells for.

 I consider myself an intermediate home trader, i still work at a full time job and run a part time business as you need a lot of money to make it worthwhile and if you are really good at it.  If i buy a $5.00 stock and it goes up 1% in a day ($.05) I would need 4,000 shares to make $200.00 before trading commissions.  at $200.00 per day i couldn't leave my current employment and $20,000.00 it a lot to risk upfront w/o any knowledge or experience in the market.    

the first tactic i used was to find stocks that were undervalued.  this works some of the time but don't expect a quick turn around when it does work.  I am sitting on $25,000 shares of canceled worldcom stock and lost money recently on rite aid (RAD) - bought at $1.70 and sold at $1.00 - i didnt cut my losses early.  

Also there is no reason to day trade.  all trades can be setup in advance.  I setup my trades the evening before or morning of when i want to buy or sell something.  If i really need to trade mid-day i can use my lunch time.  "

http://valdaoresearch.com/archives/the-us-equity-market-vs-industrial-production/

It's very difficult to short the US stock market given the manipulation going on.  Especially with the continually declining trading volumes.  

Unfortunately, the active shorting won't be able to start until it's obvious US companies are not meeting the forecast numbers 4Q12 and 1Q13.  And they'll need to miss be a wide margin...

Shorting is tough to do and requires good research on individual industries and companies (most don't put the time in on useful research to short properly).  Shorts must be watched like a hawk in this environment...

There are two ways to make more than the standard market return. 

1. You buy low and sell high. To do this you have to be smarter than the two other guys, the first who just bought too high too late and the other guy who initially sold too low too soon. Is you dad stock smart?

2. You leverage up. For every $50 your father invests, he could borrow another $50. If things go well, he just doubled his returns. If things don't go well however, he just doubled his losses.

2012-12-13 16:46:06,"If he truly wants to be an investor, then he needs to read up on it as others have suggested. This should take months to years before actually putting money in. Signing up for an online site will give him access to a virtual trading account (Optionshouse has this, but I know others do as well) this way he can get the feel for trading without the risk of losing anything.

I'm also going to assume most of this advice will fly in one ear and out the other. People who want to day trade see the $$$ that CAN be made...but unless you get lucky, you are more likely to lose it. 

The biggest advice I give to a new investor is to 1. not buy a company thats a ""penny stock"" (stock price under $5) and 2. ALWAYS research a company before buying. This means checking out financial statements, understanding what that company actually does to make money, and then decide if you think they will be able to continue growing.. remember, stock prices are more tied to current and future growth, not what they have done before."
2012-12-13 15:09:20,Agreed. You have to also consider what percentage of gains you will be happy with. More money means your trade doesn't have to move as much. 
2012-12-13 14:30:54,You're not daytrading if you've never lost a dime in a trade. 
2012-12-13 14:23:25,"&gt;If he is planning on trading with anything less than $50,000, he is setting himself up for failure. Commissions and fees will eat away at his profits.

I hear this a lot, and it doesn't really make sense. Most pattern daytrading accounts have an option for per-share commissions, (I pay $.01 per share up to 500 shares, $.005 thereafter). If you're trading position sizes reasonable to your account size, have non-trading money set aside to live on, and paper-trade until you're consistent, $30k is plenty to get started.

That being said, I agree that it's important to decide for him to decide how much he can lose, and that a year to learn is realistic, if not even a little on the quick side."
2012-12-13 13:51:17,"I get paranoid when I hear this.

I didn't study the market much, thought ""hey, this is an opportunity no one else sees!"" the first time I invested and gained 25%.

When I hear things like 80% of day traders fail, I think (well, shit. Did I get lucky?)

So far I haven't lost a dime in a single trade, which makes me even more paranoid. &gt;_&gt;"
2012-12-13 13:17:19,"Agreed. AT LEAST a year. He has to learn about how the market works, technical indicators and crunch the numbers of how much he can actually make with what he plans on trading with.

If he is planning on trading with anything less than $50,000, he is setting himself up for failure. Commissions and fees will eat away at his profits. A few bad trades will be enough to put him out as well. 

Even ""paper trading"" will not expose him to what it is really like. It is much different when you are using real money. Keep track of how much money he has in his paper account as well. It is easy to say ""okay, I learned my lesson and wont make that mistake again"" but then see what the profit/loss looks like on his account.

If there is no talking him out of it, make him set a MAX amount he is willing to lose before calling it quits. I would recommend 10%. "
2012-12-13 12:50:12,"Tell him not to spend over $100 on his trading education and send him to [Big Mike's Trading Forum](http://www.bigmiketrading.com) to watch the ""Where to start?"" webinars.  He should expect a year or more of watching the screen for 4+ hours a day before even putting money down.  Tell him most teachers are a scam and not to waste his time or money.  There is plenty of free information on the internet."

2012-12-13 11:40:25,"Sure.  Most traders lose money.  About [80% of day traders fail](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/03/10/an-80-chance-youll-fail.aspx)

He needs to have an edge if he wants to be a winner.  And he doesn't now.

If he's serious, have him devote to learning for a minimum of a year, maybe trade stocks on paper for that time to see how he does, and reevaluate.

If he's not willing to do that, then I can't help you."

2012-12-13 10:34:03,"Some here will probably disagree with me on this one. Don't bother investing $2000. The kind of gains you require to overcome the commission costs makes things too difficult. Pay off any and all debt and continue saving your money, preferably in a savings account that yields some kind of interest."
2012-12-13 10:17:50,"There is a big difference on speculative stocks and penny stocks.  Penny stocks are very high risk and are prone to manipulation... at least here in the States. A lot of those penny stocks don't support enough volume to give you liquidity unless you happen to hit it right. You can get stuck with illiquid shares even when you have an unrealized gain. If you are young, it is fine to speculate, but I'd keep penny stocking to a minimum. Check out www.timothysykes.com if you are interested in penny stocks.

2012-12-12 23:30:09,"First, since you are asking this question you really shouldn't be picking individual stocks, better to go with broad indexes.  Also, considering the excessive amount of private debt/nominal income buildup in Australia, it wouldn't be too smart to go all long equities at this point in time.  You have to look at valuations, and they aren't very attractive right now. Most importantly I would stay away from financials or even short them, and go long healthcare and technology."

You are going to have to put in some time here and study up. $1000 into blue chips or the Australian index will not generate much gains, but will diversify you.

2014-08-03 21:49:32,"The good thing about zynga is its a company not based on selling products so much as creating a hit game (ie: Clash of clans, candy crush, kim kardashian fashion game lol...) so if you have faith that they arent just sucking their revenue dry and that they could create another farmville you might be okay. With that in mind its highly unlikely. They had so many chances as the only company with great revenue from facebook games to enter and dominate the app market and they just sat idle on farmville facebook games and that is what is sinking their ship.

I personally would hold if your not too heavy into it give it another year...I have a gut feeling that they are going to at least throw a new in-house game out there in the next 3 to 6 monthes and if I was you I would immediately download and try it out see if it could be a winner if its not sell on the good news and get out while you can."

&gt; Yes. Extra hours trading is available at TradeKing. Pre-market orders may be entered between 8:00am - 9:30am ET; post-market orders may be entered between 4:00pm - 5:00pm ET on regular trading days. You may enter limit orders only. An order placed during an after-hours trading session is only good for the session during which the order was placed. If an order is not executed during a specific after-hours session, the order expires at the end of the session and does not roll into the next traditional or after-hours session. Orders not yet executed can still be canceled before the close of a session, in the same way as during traditional market hours. Orders executed during an after-hours session are considered to have been executed during the day's traditional session for settlement and clearing purposes.

After taking some losses from increasing short exposure, I game up by the week's end and went back long. 

I don't think this is going to turn into a bear market just because the bears are probably too scared from the last few attempts. I doubt they will short with serious conviction.

2014-08-01 08:14:04,"It's not about being good or lucky...it's about being smart. Read about risk management and reward to risk ratios in trading. Check out www.swing-trade-stocks.com ... One of my favorite sites for getting started with swing trading. Learn to read candlestick charts and some technical analysis patterns. You can use freestockcharts.com for charting until you get some better software. It's much better than Google finance or anything like that. 

As far as when to buy/sell...well that is the art of trading :-)

Oh...and yes if you're smart about it you can trade for a living. I do! Beware though...it's stressful and far from easy. I'd venture to it is the most difficult thing you will ever do as far as a career. "
2014-08-01 08:10:06,"That is the art of trading. I use a rule of minimum of 2x my risk. Once it hits that I usually sell a third or a half and move my stop to break even. Then I will scale out another third or the other half at 2.5x, 3x, etc. If you keep track of your commissions and the number of shares you're selling at each level, it's possible to add all the profits together to determine your net reward to risk. Generally speaking you will lose 40-60% of your trades so you need to be trading a minimum 2:1 net reward to risk... Preferably higher due to the fact that you will not be scaling out on losses."

2014-07-31 23:24:42,"Agreed! I think that Swing trading is a great way to start out. It's how I started out and every successful trader I know started out swing trading. Don't worry about becoming a day trader. If you start as a swing trader eventually you will turn into one naturally if it's going to happen. You'll just get so your ""swings"" will work so quickly that you can get out the same day and suddenly realize you're a day trader...haha

Also, stay away from penny stocks. They are the devil, lol "
2014-07-31 23:13:59,"^ This is great advice and something i didn't follow when i first got into the market ... lost a bunch on small $200 positions that i had to hold too long just to break even. Once i clean up a few positions i am going to be buying larger positions so i don't have to hold for more than a day or two before getting out with my profits. 

Another thing you might want to think about is what kind of trading are you interested in Day trading / Swing trading / DRIP / passive / long term / short term ... there are a lot of different strats and it's something that i have been learning slowly being in similar shoes as you OP ... personally i have been swing trading on momentum until i can build up enough capital to actively day trade it's a little boring but it's more fun than mutual funds or passive long term investing!

2014-07-31 23:03:06,"Scottrade's platform is laggy. Are you sure it's actually lagging on the execution and not just lagging on responding to the order? I have never seen a 5 second delay in scottrade elite though I don't use it very often. My executions on it are pretty much instant. 

If you're positive it is lagging on the actual execution, make sure you have enough RAM and that it's not the application itself lagging. I've had that happen with Thinkorswim. Also, I am not sure if the virtual trading is affecting things but it may be. Most of these companies tend to give low priority to the servers they execute virtual trades on, because, well, they're virtual and don't matter. My guess is it's a local problem though. Make sure you have enough free RAM, CPU, etc. 

For what it's worth ST Elite is not really a professional platform. It's lipstick on a pig for the most part and like ToS is mostly just flashy stuff to make people think it is powerful. You would find a lot better performance with something like DAS, Tradestation, or some kind of custom software. "
2014-07-31 22:57:11,"THIS! 

Keep it simple. Save up $2k or so, then open a simple brokerage account. Don't try to buy $100 worth of something. Invest a decent amount, maybe two stocks, $1k each in your $2k account, and make sure you don't let your loss get too big...maybe $50-100 out of each $1k investment. The key to profitable investment is risk management. Keep losses small and let winners run. Don't fall into the trap of believing that just because you invested $2k in something you are risking the full $2k. Usually you will only risk a small portion of that, and it will give you a good chance to make 5-10% relatively quickly and if it doesn't work you just get out for a 2-3% loss. "

I wasn't trying to be rude. I was being serious in the hopes you'd reconsider trying to day trade with &lt; $25k. If you don't understand prop trading, how to find the companies that do it, you probably do not understand the implications of day trading, level 2, time and sales, dark pools, HFTs, ECN fees, commission structures, etc. The $25k limit exists for a reason. It's to protect both the broker and the client. With all these companies there will be catches: profit sharing, platform fees, ECN and routing fees, inactivity fees, wire in/wire out fees, and with many of them you risk them taking your money and you not being able to do anything about it because they are not under the same regulations as retail brokers. The thing that tipped me off is that you said you are trying to avoid the free-riding rule and did not even mention the pattern day trading rule which indicates you might not even know what it is. The $25k limit is not related to the free riding rule. That's why I am guessing you don't fully understand all the rules/risks of day trading. It's not that you can't learn it, but just be careful. 

Make sure you know what you're getting into. "

RustedMechanical is right about the commissions, they will be pain if you only start out with a few hundred euro.  Every traded you make, you will be praying to earn enough to cover the cost of the purchase and sale.  That is no fun at all!
I've helped three friends into investing, the same way I started.  Here's the short story....
Save up a small pile of money, £1000-£1500. I started with $2000, which was a good pile of cash for me.  Consider it to be 'Education' money.  The amount you are willing to lose in the name of learning how and when to trade.  
Open an account with a very reputable and simple to understand brokerage.  Scottrade for example.  $7 a trade.  Simple to manage.  
Next, do your homework.  Look into stocks of companies that you have some sort of interest in.  The last friend I helped liked the 3D printers. He thought they were fun.  So I told him to learn all he can about the ones that are publicly traded.  If you invest in companies, industries or products that you already have an interest in, it makes it easier to continue your research and stay current with what's happening.  
Then make your first purchase.  See what happens.  Hopefully it goes up.  Make your first sale.  Just break the ice.  

That's all for now. Hope this helps. "

""Sell in May and go away""

""Sell in May and Go Away..."" is believed by many to originate from the Victorian era when wealthy individuals would vacate London in May due to the unbearable stench from the sewers, realising their investments beforehand.

Not so, according to Professor of Economic History at the Sorbonne, Dr Avril Poisson, whose paper on the subject explains that is actually an old English nautical term originating shortly after the invention of the telegraph.

When in Portsmouth preparing his flagship for battle with the French in 1865, first Lord of the Admiralty, Sir John Therjowkesonu, actually telegraphed the message: ""Sail in May - we go; aweigh!"" to his illiterate Factor, the hapless Owain Watson in London.

Sir John was a well-known private investor, and his Factor misconstrued the message -- erroneously relaying the communication to ""sell in May"" all the First Lord's substantial holdings -- as his master was going ""away"".

Ironically, this proved to be a timely call as the market slumped on 1 May -- a huge percentage fall triggered by the Lord's own across-the-board selling in what came to be known as ""Mournful-Monday-Mayday"".

The saying ""sell in May and go away"" has stuck ever since and is still deemed to be wise advice for investors as shrewd as the fortunate Admiral."

 [**Cargo cult**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo%20cult): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __cargo cult__ is a [Melanesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesia) [millenarian movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennarianism_in_colonial_societies) encompassing a diverse range of practices and occurring in the wake of contact with the commercial networks of colonizing societies. The name derives from the apparent belief that various ritualistic acts will lead to a bestowing of material wealth (""cargo"").  

&gt;Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a ""[vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(spirituality\))"" (or ""myth-dream"") of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality.   This leader may characterize the present state (often imposed by colonial capitalist regimes) as a dismantling of the old social order, meaning that social hierarchy and ego boundaries have been broken down. 

&gt;Contact with colonizing groups brought about a considerable transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the trade networks involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new *social* relationships, with material relations being secondary. 

&gt;Since the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen. For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western [commodity fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism).  Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term ""cargo cult"" for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.

2014-05-01 16:08:13,"/u/CallMeNeil and the thread thereafter are 100% right, but I'd just like to add:

If you can't stick to your plan, then you're not making any progress. Any gains you get are an illusion: you will eventually fail. Don't trade to make money, trade to trade well.

And don't ""play at trading"", which you are. You rattle off a whole bunch of numbers, when you're up and when you're down... it doesn't matter. If I told a robot to buy 6 completely random stocks, I'll be up and down sometimes too. Stop focusing on that. It's like when people play at being entrepreneurs... they follow the trappings of starting a business, like getting a perfect logo and making an LLC or all that other stuff, rather than actually selling a product or service. It's like a [cargo cult](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult); if it looks right, then it will work! But it won't.

I used to sit at my computer at precisely 9:29am every market day, watching the ticker count down to the opening bell on my broker's website. I had coffee in hand, half a sandwich sitting next to me, a few useless financial news sites tabbed on Firefox, Pandora was all loaded up... I was a trader! It was time to start trading! I was a damn fool about it, and thankfully I didn't have to lose **too** much money before I figured that out.

Being a trader is not about trading. It's about having a plan. If your plan says that right now is a bad time to trade... don't. Don't sit at your computer. Don't watch the market go up or down. Don't trade just because you haven't traded in 3 days and you feel itchy. And once you place your trade AND have exits all planned out, don't follow your stock.

Don't watch it grow, don't watch it shrink, don't watch it do anything. If at all possible, set your stop-loss and profit taking points in advance so your broker will automatically fill them if they reach those prices. Then, take a step back. Watching your stock won't help it, you'll just get emotional. Take a step back and let your plan carry you. You're 20: go get laid or play some video games. You'll be surprised at how you managed to completely miss a scary 3% dip in a stock you bought only to take profit and be up 5% on it 2 days later. You'll realize that the market behaves on longer time scales than you're used to thinking in, that losses are part of the game, and that, if your plan is solid and you're following it well, the gains will come. Today's loss pre-sages tomorrow's big win. Be confident in your plan.

I highly recommend [Trading in the Zone](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Zone-Confidence-Discipline-Attitude/dp/0735201447/ref=la_B001IGOXOE_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398974328&amp;sr=1-1) by Mark Douglas. The ""experiment"" at the end of the book should help you understand how you need to start thinking if you want to succeed."

Becton Dickinson–The medical products maker earned $1.45 per share for the second quarter, missing estimates by five cents. However, the company did boost its full year earnings outlook, calling the second quarter ""solid.""

Generac–The maker of generating systems fell two cents short of estimates with first quarter profit of 72 cents per share, with sales falling short as well. Generac said the cold winter weather delayed the installation of residential units.

Cigna–The insurance company earned $1.83 per share for the first quarter, well above estimates of $1.54, though revenue was slightly short of estimates. Cigna did see improved revenue from areas such as group disability and life insurance.

Intuitive Surgical–The maker of surgical systems has been told by the FDA that it has addressed manufacturing violations that had been mentioned in a prior warning letter.

Beazer Homes–The home builder lost 31 cents per share for the second quarter, wider than the 20 cent loss analysts had been expecting. Revenue was also short of estimates, with new home orders falling 8.6 percent amid bad weather."

2014-05-01 08:01:57,You a cool dude
2014-05-01 07:20:18,waza waza harigato. why the tips? gentlemen
2014-05-01 05:42:28,"Thanx! I actually understood this on , well, my own paining errors as well. I learnt that i actually placed on high beta stocks and now am checking stocks and funds for such parameters (like standard deviation, sharpe). I know i should get even more knowledge, but a year ago i was sure less smarter and decided to actually start small - the sum was of no issue. With time i was recovering and placed more bets, no other way i can call it, cause indeed - i had no deep understanding of what i am investing in. Although i did chose some good stocks based on deep analysis of others (Himax, Micron tech) and they could have brought me more as i could have made 100% on them easy. But even with the people dissecting the company, each time they would start a dip i'd bail - and each time i would regret afterwards and get back in. 

Recently i got to learn more on technical analysis, and i actually managed to make a good call! Exited Himax at 14, and it is around 8-9 now (i could have exited at 16, but i was sure it could go up more). So i am wondering if it is the time to buy - but i have no clue if it is or not because i don't know how to know this yet. Technicals may show me a floor, but fundamentally - maybe something is wrong or it was a hype? It is high beta. 

Indeed it is not even day to day for me sometimes - it is hour to hour. I cannot stop micromanaging and reading all sorts of stuff on the stocks once they are in red - ""what is happening !!"" is the feeling i get. Funny enough my whole stock market adventure started with FB. I waited for the ipo, seen it dip, wanted to buy it at 20. and at 23 before the earnings i missed to buy as i needed a day to transfer the money. Same with Zynga - they decided to report early. Still both of the moves are playing...gambling on earnings. I even have a rule now selling before earnings. 

I guess the catch i have is - i should indeed not day trade. All my losses are the fees that i paid over the year. 4% of my total sum! Then again if i should be an investor, i would need more confidence and understanding - i could get this with getting more knowledge on what i am actually doing and investing in. And as people noted, i need a plan. I also need diversification - i was almost 70% in US stocks, and MU/Himax had around 15 or even 20%  of my money - yes, i went that batshit crazy. Luckily i sized down before i went in minus. With time i came up with a set of rules for myself and still, i was at some point avoiding them. Ill need to make a more firm plan, size down my total exposure, and learn more on technical and fundamental analysis. And as greenbartrading noted, i would need to get my head in the right state for this. 

With this, i think i don't want to be a day trader as it seems to be too much of stress for me - and i know you can't win all the time, but i sure hate the heart rush i get when i am loosing big and fast. "
2014-05-01 05:23:42,"Thank you sir! And thank you for a great comment - i re-read it several times to make sure i understood it fully. I was afraid i would be stomped by people here telling me to go back to kindergarden and that these posts are not to be here. I figured out trading is 80% emotion - if i would not have those fears to get into the positions sooner, and not have those fears of losing money, i actually would be better of (after seeing a simulation of other actions). Still, a plan it is. One question to you though - do you employ technical analysis at all? I see some people not watching the fundamentals and doing all on technical analysis - is this a correct way at all? (i am sure no the only way, but is it possible to make it useful bidding 70% on technical analysis and not caring that much on fundamentals and news?)"

At 100 it's right at the top of the trading range, hitting new highs.

The divergence you are talking about occurs because whatever was weighing down the RSI has fallen off the look-back period. Imagine share falls 20% and then 50 days later even if it hasn't moved back up the RSI can keep getting higher, becase what matters is the recent range. 

So, you could have a stock going up and RSI falling because the old data is falling out of the calculation tables. Basically meaning, that it's old news. Add to that, the fact that technical trading is a jsut a market hive mind strategy. If enough people start looking at same lines and number they all draw common conclusions. "

2014-04-30 21:17:17,"&gt; It is a difficult thing for most people to double-down when they are heavily invested in a LOSING trade. You are psychologically looking to get out / sell with a minimal loss. You are not looking to buy. You are filled with emotion and panic.
Think of it this way... you can make 6 mistakes, each down 50 cents, before you equal 1 mistake down $3. One mistake down $3 is a big hit, and it also fucks up your mind for the next trade. You just lost $600. If you had only lost $100, and had faith in your plan, you'd know making $100 back is not a difficult task. But if you lost $600, and you do NOT have faith in your plan, you know getting that back is hard.

This sums it up quite nice! Indeed i can't double down, i can only sell a half of it.I did have a track record indeed, and believe it or not, i did not worry so much when i was in plus, so i got worried only when i actually got in minus. It is hard for me to see the stock going up as, indeed, i do not understand quite well the stock behaviors as it is so different and random - you never know what news come out, when and how fatal are they. In any case to double down you would need to still keep your investment in the stock - that is already a problem. I think you have something there with the research - any link to an article? "

While i was invested in some companies that did mediocre, i had other ideas to get into . I put more money in account to get into them and ultimately i did get up on the account - but as my account grew, my risk grew as well. And once the markets changed direction i got hit hard cause i had risky positions. I had a big plus in biotech fonds and that equaled to my stock losses, soon as biotech started failing with the stocks, my account suffered a decline. Live and learn i guess....more learning to do!"

Without ""safe"" investments that the Fed/Federal Government took that away, people are pushing more money into equities. Not necessarily because they perceive a certain value for these equities, but because it's either invest or equities or lose money to inflation."

On your chart your can see that MACD has been falling since the middle of May! Yet TSLA kept going higher.

In my younger days I would have taken that falling MACD as a sign the stock was about to tank, yet up it went for another 50 points.

When momentum kicks in on stocks like this, most indicators are useless. Traders will stick to the basics like trend lines and areas of previous support and resistance.

2013-07-18 21:34:09,"I'm not exactly sure what you are asking, but if you want to discuss moving averages 101 here's a good place to start:  **the moving average crossover strategy.**

First, pick two moving averages, a slow one and a fast one.  Take [this long term chart of gold](http://www.kitco.com/lfgif/au3650lf_ma.gif) just as an example.  It has a 60 day moving average (blue) and a 200 day moving average (green).

The strategy is that every time the two lines cross each other you either go long or sell short, depending on which way they crossed.  If the fast-line crosses the slow-line from below, that's when you go long.  If the fast-line dives down through the slow-line from above, you want to short.

So for example, looking at this chart you would have short sold gold around Sep 2008 at a price of about $900 an ounce.  Then you would have covered your short some months later at about 850(?) or so and gone long.  Then you would have kept that long position through thick and thin and you'd finally have sold when gold was well over 1600 or so, at which point you would have gone short.

Based on that little example it seems foolproof--in fact if you did this with gold prices exactly as presented, you'd be rich.  But nothing's ever that easy.  

For one thing you'll never get out exactly at the top nor will you ever correctly pick a bottom. You'll be the kind of investor to buy once the party's already started, and then sell at the first sign of trouble.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing!

However, if you follow this strategy to the letter you'll end up sometimes buying something only to turn around quickly and sell it.  (Or the opposite on the short side.)  This is called a ""whipsaw"", and that's why this strategy is not a nonstop train of winning trades. 

Another problem with the moving average crossover strategy is that there are an infinite number of moving averages to look at.  Do you compare the 60 day with the 200 day, or the 50 day with the 100 day?  Computers have found that the 7-day and 23-day comparison is often valid!  They are all possibly significant.  But if you pick the wrong moving averages to compare your results could be utterly different.  It's always easy to find the right strategy in hindsight.

Best of luck."

2014-11-09 22:26:13,"If you are new to technical analysis, it would be very confusing.  Technical analysis is a very board field.  It's a rather nonsensical question to ask whether technical analysis works because everyone eventually have to find their own niche, their own way of analyzing the market.  They may all fall under the heading of technical analysis but everybody does it a little differently.

Another thing to remember is nothing works all the time.  A megaphone may work in some situation but not others.  The key to find methods that works high percentage of time.  Even then you will find it's effectiveness diminish over time as others discover the same pattern and front run or trap you.

2014-11-09 21:23:12,"Your questions get to the heart of confusions around technical analysis. If it's not predictive, it's useless.

If you can't create a testable system with a positive expectancy (likelihood to make a profit), you're going to have a bad time.

There is a boatload of nonsense out there regarding market analysis. Stay skeptical and keep on learning :)

do any of these trends make any predictive power?  it seems like you could always just point at the geometries of prices vs time and say ""here is a megaphone shape"" or some other shape.  but what does that tell you, specifically, about people's intuition to buy or sell?  and what if the megaphone shape fails to hold up over time?

or do you use this to indicate general trends to triangulate risk?  it seems very useful for that. anyway, thanks for the help/time.

2014-11-07 15:37:11,"I thought there were two or three companies that tried this and it was rejected, could be wrong.

I heard Jim Chanos once say that SHLD doesn't have any more good real estate left. The attractive pieces were already sold. Who can take over a 5 - 10k sqft lease: WMT (who doesn't do mall sites), HD and LOW (ditto), DKS maybe. So they wait for their expensive leases to end and then leave the site, which doesn't change anything for equity holders except mean there is more inventory at other stores that aren't selling shit. If they own the real estate, what do they do with it since if it could be sold, it probably would be sold.  

If these other stores become more valuable to the owners because of the real estate, then the best move would be to kick sears out and chop up that large platform to sell to restaurants (but Panera &amp; Chipotle don't move into low income neighborhoods last I saw) so it is MCD, Long John Silver or something similar if that, which already have a presence in those neighborhoods. 

If I buy SHLD and get the REIT shares once spun out that could be interesting, but then I need to short SHLD again. Someone smarter than me probably needs to figure out what to do with this company, I have no clue. "

&gt;The retailer, which has been coming up with an array of maneuvers to raise cash to get through the holiday season, announced Friday morning that it is looking at forming a REIT for 200 to 300 of its stores. (Sears operates about 1,870 stores in the U.S.)

&gt;Moving to a REIT structure has been a big trend among corporations this year, and offer companies a way to slash their tax bills. REITS must pay out at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, but in turn pay no corporate taxes. Just yesterday casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment Inc.PNK -2.67% announced that it is considering spinning off its real estate into a REIT.

Also I think there is bias in the portfolio so not really worth it in real life. Fundamental analysis and value investing should be what you should look for."
2014-11-06 11:22:21,"You can't play Warren Buffett's game.  He can call up IBM's CEO and have a nice long chat with him, you can't.  Warren Buffett invests in people more than anything else.  He would invest if he thinks the company officers are good business people.  Unfortunately, with tech companies, good people aren't always enough, and we don't know if that's enough for IBM, and even if it is, it could be many years down the road.

We are in a booming bull market and IBM is in a multi-year low, that's always indication of a sinking ship.

2014-11-06 10:52:25,"sorry a little late with this post here (meant to have it up yesterday) while i'm not one to personally give too much significance on this, but i know this is one of wall street's most favorite indicators ""dow theory""

basic dow theory is when the dow industrials and dow transportation indices both closes at an important high or low

here is a slightly more detailed explanation of dow theory for those who are new and have never heard such a thing-

&gt; **What it is:**

&gt; Dow Theory is an analysis that explores the relationship between the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA). When one of these averages climbs to an intermediate high, then the other is expected to follow suit within a reasonable amount of time. If not, then the averages show ""divergence"" and the market is liable to reverse course.

&gt; **How it works/Example:**

&gt; Dow Theory has its origins in the writings of Charles Dow -- founder of the Wall Street Journal and creator of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. His editorials pioneered technical analysis. On his death in 1902, William Hamilton continued Dow's work, writing editorials of his own until 1929. Robert Rhea then collected the work of both of these men and used it as a basis to publish The Dow Theory in 1932.

&gt; This book expounds upon many key principles of technical analysis, such as defining the nature of the primary, secondary and minor trends. Dow Theory divergence is fully explained in the idea that ""the two averages must confirm.""

&gt; In Dow's time, the two averages were the Industrials and the Rails. The logic behind the theory is simple: Industrial companies manufactured the goods and the rails shipped them. When one average recorded a new secondary or intermediate high, the other average was required to do the same in order for the signal to be considered valid.

&gt; If the two averages acted in harmony -- with both reaching new highs or lows around the same time period -- then the price action of each was said to be confirming.

&gt; However, if one average went to a new high, while the other was left behind, then there was bearish divergence. If the opposite occurred, with one average reaching a new low while the other held above a previous bottom, then the divergence was bullish.

&gt; At present, of course, the rails are now the Transports. However, Dow Theorists argue that the principle remains valid. As such, they contend that the activity of the Industrials and Transports provides a filter to detect whether the stock market is in a healthy or unhealthy state.

&gt; **Why it Matters:**

&gt; The behavior of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  typically grabs the headlines. Few investors, however, are aware of the tenets of Dow Theory. By understanding the Dow Theory, traders are better able to spot hidden trends that more experienced investors may be noticing. This allows them to make more informed decisions regarding their open positions."

2014-11-05 22:25:03,"They'll gladly give you an account.  They want you to open an account, it's a sure here you go type deal. A margin account is a different story but that's far into the NO territory for things you do for quite a while.  You fund the account with money that you have, and more importantly- can financially withstand losing.  Margin talk is ridiculous at this point in time for you.

It sounds like there may be a credit check involved but unless you worried about a potential minor ding to your credit score its not a concern tho.  Credit checks only effect temporary so I guess read up on how much a credit check effects your score and how long if that's a concern. Otherwise, get it done.

They will ask you questions about your finances, those aren't for determining if you'll be allowed to open an account, those are required by the SEC.

I'd suggest learning the tools/research before you even fund your account, even if your trading plan doesn't really involve much detail, take some time and immerse yourself in the environment.

2014-11-05 16:03:15,"my apologies for the late response here...been super swamped all day today

well, to be perfectly honest here, i feel my opinion is good as anyone else's... what i mean by that is, simply, while i could give out of my belief of what i think may happen, i am often reluctant to do so as i don't want to steer anyone in the wrong direction or mislead anyone into any particular belief... perhaps one could say that this is approach is far too conservative and not very convincing at all... true... but, i try to leave my opinions &amp; beliefs out of the markets, and just trade what i see, not what i think or believe... and in this case what i see in the charts (this particular chart anyway) right now is that a stronger dollar (at least for the past 6 months as is illustrated in this chart) has meant weak commodities such as pm's and crude oil as is exhibited by the comparison chart i had posted early this morning... while this relationship hasn't always been 100% perfect to a tee, it's worked out more or less a majority of the time...

i honestly do not know with 100% certainty if this strong dollar continues into the future, if i did i likely wouldn't be here right now... but, just looking at the chart right now, while there may be a short-term dollar pullback (which would more than likely mean a short-term rally in the metals) in the near future due to the nature of just how oversold the metals have gotten down here, and how over extended the dollar has ripped on the upside in the past 3 months...the usd had recently broken a long-term downtrend line that goes all the way back to 2002 on the weekly time frame = bullish dollar, and bearish commodities...

apologies if this is not convincing enough of an analysis, but this is just what i am seeing in the charts right now... making no absolute assumptions or predictions as to what will happen as i feel that is kind of a futile effort personally..."

2015-05-18 15:07:19,Agreed!
2015-05-18 15:06:59,"Sorry, I was very sleepy. 

On the long term, I don't think you can predict price change based on premises like ""over valued"". I mean, you say it's not based on actual results, but how good are current profit rates? How much debt they still need to pay? Stuff like that.
The stock market sells expectation and takes everything into account. Expectations are mostly based on actual results, guesses and speculation only matter on the short term. 

In my opinion there's no such thing as "" overvaluation"". If the company keeps growing and showing us good numbers (profit, lower debt, etc.) there's no reason to predict a consistent price drop.

2015-05-18 14:59:59,"&gt; According to Tobin’s Q, equities in the U.S. are valued about 10 percent above the cost of replacing their underlying assets -- higher than any time other than the Internet bubble and the 1929 peak.

Of course, by ""underlying asset"" they're talking about factories, buildings, machines, land, etc.  What they're not including in this valuation is intellectual property and innovative technologies that exist digitally.

For example, Google's algorithms have substantial value to the company's ability to generate revenue, but for the purposes of the Q ratio, are worthless since they are intangible assets.  This of course, isn't a real picture of the value of Google... Facebook.... Netflix... (insert any company in a service industry with substantial intellectual property)

I love their ""history"" tab:

&gt;H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. was founded in 1868 at the Union Bank Building in Boston, Massachusetts, located at the heart of the strongest financial center in post-Civil War America. Housed at 40 State Street in the same building as the Boston Stock Exchange, H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. had the advantage of crafting each line of business in-step with the financial landscape of the time.

Sounds fancy, but then for a contact number, it tells you to contact the CEO directly, so its obviously a small company.

Not that its bad, but I do find it interesting to see how these things operate.

Did they recycle and existing company name or did this company actually exist since 1868?

2015-05-18 06:25:34," You need to do your own research. Media won't provide tips for free, analysts won't work for free. Media provides what people want to hear. Forbes will never be known for bad tips, even if they really are bad, so they lose nothing. Good analysis takes a ton of work.

Also, if you want to win in this game you need to take responsibility. Be accountable for your own mistakes instead of following tips and analysts and blaming them later for your losses.

Finally, in my experience, when stuff like that reaches the mainstream media, it's either too late to profit anything or too early to bet with enough accuracy. If there were enough information to paint a promising picture, the price would already be high, since the stock market sells expectation. Everyone I knew who tried to profit ignoring this principle failed miserably.

Before delving into these types of situations, I think all traders would find value in understanding the biases and, more importantly, heuristics that we are subject to.What I mean by heuristics, is that we often try to find mental shortcuts to justify decisions. This is what happens when we start looking at situations from an oversimplified point of view.

In reality, everything is much more complex and the most effective way to make stock market bets is by accounting and controlling for the most important variables in specific industries/companies/markets/etc."
2015-08-21 19:49:30,"I think if anything, the internet security-based companies (or companies which bought out internet security firms - think Intel, Mcafee) will be affected the most.

2015-08-21 19:46:39,Thanks for the response. I did some research into insurance firms but haven't seen any noticeable changes in valuation that might correlate to the hack. So you're probably right - people with divorce insurance policies likely make up a very small portion of the customer base.
2015-08-21 19:42:05,"I feel like if someone got their data hacked at ashley madison, they'd be very very wary of putting their information into another dating website. I'd even go as far as to say that maybe these other dating sites' consumer base will feel unsettled in their own company's online security. I wouldn't say there's any way to predict what would happen to other dating websites.

As for the divorce firm situation, I still think that the number of people affected is way too small to know which insurance firms will benefit the most. At most, you'd have maybe 50% of the ashley madison clientele married (a total guess - but I thinkk it's a fair estimate). You'd have to essentially guess which firm has the highest overlap with Ashley Madison. I don't think this is a large enough size to cause any significant increase in insurance firm profits.
"
2015-08-21 19:20:28,Almost certainly. It's just a matter if you're able to stomach the losses in the short term.
2015-08-21 18:52:57,"Media is taking a dump right now.  In order for these media companies to recover, I think they need to offer cable-less subscription services.  The number of cord-cutters is slowly increasing and media companies need to put a strategy in place that will allow for a seamless transition for users who were tied to cable but are now open to streaming content via the internet.  As far as Disney's stock is concerned, I agree that Star Wars and Shanghai will give it a nice bump...so long as the products are good.  

As far as Apple is concerned, I think it's possible that Apple reaches 120 again this year.  It's also possible that Apple won't reach $120 again until next year's iPhone 7/7 Plus release.  S model years are not ground breaking.  Like Disney, I don't see why Apple can't reach $150 per share.  That being said, I don't see why Apple couldn't reach $500 per share within the next 10 years.  Apple car, Apple cellular service, Apple television streaming, improved Apple music streaming, and of course the evolution of the watch, phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc.  The potential is there for big gains."

That being said, I'm wondering how much more of a dip the stock will take.  I'm also wondering if Star Wars and Shanghai Disney will be enough to help the stock recover.  I don't see why Disney couldn't get all the way up to $150 so long as they increase their revenues and Star Wars and Shanghai Disney perform as expected."
2015-08-21 18:39:59,"I have no tolerance for any sort of loss.  Could I afford to take a loss?  Sure.  Am I willing to?  No.  I own 100 shares of Disney and 100 shares of Apple.  I bought Apple at $96 per share last year and Disney at $81 per share last year.  I let them sit because I intended on having them as long term investments.  Hindsight says I should've sold last month, but I'm not in the red yet.  I'm just wondering if the stocks will recover.  Even if they reach $120 again, I may not sell because I don't see why they couldn't reach as high as $150 per share."
2015-08-21 18:24:33,I dropped 20K today. Great time to get in. 
2015-08-21 18:21:59,"I think Disney will bounce back lightly with Star Wars and Shanghai opening. Media is hurting do to lower revenues so ABC and ESPN will need to turn it around. 

Apple scares me. Phone companies are not subsidizing as much and I think mobile device sales will begin to slow. On top of that, the Apple Watch and Apple music aren't doing so great so Apple will really need to pull of the Apple TV with deals with content providers. 

That being said, I bought 90 shares of Disney and 100 shares of Netflix today."

2015-08-21 17:15:10,"I used to work in an elementary school; so let me tell you, Star Wars **is** bigger than Frozen. But with that said, I feel like the merchandising for Star Wars occurred *before* its release, so the release in theaters is going to bring a comparatively reduced cash flow because you couldn't very well sell Elsa dolls and backpacks to kids until after they fell in love with the movie; Disney saw profit from the theaters *and* from merchandising when they released Frozen, but that entire half of the Star Wars market has already been capitalized on.

Nonetheless, $DIS is going to go back up. I can't tell you how long that might take; I only recently started investing in the stock market and quite frankly, this recent downturn scares the crap out of me."

2015-08-21 01:41:12,"The risk is of course the short squeeze. If there is a large amount of short interest, say more than 10x the daily trade volume, any short interest is in trouble if the stock price starts to rise. If the stock does well, the timid short interest are motivated to buy the stock to cut their losses. This can drive the price up to the point causing a panic rush to buy stock, with there being so much more short interest than daily trade volume, the stock price can sky rocket during a short squeeze. Potential loss to the short interest is arbitrarily large.

I suppose if the short interest were unfounded or malicious in nature, smart money large institutions could just sink money into long positions on the stock for a few days and drive the price upwards trying to trigger a short squeeze. I suppose there is an equilibrium that largely keeps this relationship in check."

The alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) approved today imposes restrictions on short selling only when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day. At that point, short selling would be permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid.

Rule 201 includes the following features:

    Short Sale-Related Circuit Breaker: The circuit breaker would be triggered for a security any day in which the price declines by 10 percent or more from the prior day's closing price.

    Duration of Price Test Restriction: Once the circuit breaker has been triggered, the alternative uptick rule would apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day."

In case anyone with $100 (of real money) is reading this looking for hot tips... don't be dumb. In a case like this, preservation of capital past 4 months is irrelevant. Whether you're up 20% or lose your life savings won't matter here, only the ones who luck out on long shots will win. This isn't investing, it's a gambling competition... I'm not sure why they have them. Whoever wins will probably have a lot of luck, so you might as well bet big with high risk, no hedging, low diversification, no safe bets, no indexes. You'll probably lose anyway, just like the lottery, but someone will have dumb luck.

Google ""stock contest results"" and ""[month-name] stock contest results"" for some ideas of what type of companies win these things. Don't use the same companies, unless you see a reason they'll repeat a freak pop.

Remember this isn't investment advice!

\*Edit: Some stocks look like they'd win some 1-month contests and lose as many, such as SYN. Google ""most volatile stocks"" with a recent time range for more ideas. I think... look for stocks whose charts have wild swings that last several months. Something like SYN swings wildly within a month, but might even out too much over 4 months. Look into the reason for swings because ""past performance is not indicative of future results""."

Robotic trading has paid itself back, in full, at least 10 times over. The mistakes i have not made due to watching those videos are innumerable. Clay is a level-headed, full-time daytrader. If you are on the fence about who he is as a person, try watching one of his live trades. He is knowledgable and wise in his decision making, and does his best to pass on his standards in his videos. I'd strongly suggest Robotic Trading to anyone, it is absolutely worth the money. The others are great too i'm sure, but i can't speak about them personally. 

PSSG was great for the penny rush back in 2013, but the tactics in it are now widely-known. In my opinion, the knowledge Clay worked to spread changed the penny stock market in an amazing way. Pump and dumps are rarely successful nowadays because of the standard notion that there is a bigger player behind them making money off of the small-time retail traders. Clay was always in message boards calling people out for pumping, and spreading know-how on what he called ""drinking the kool-aid."" He really is a remarkable guy, cant suggest his stuff enough. "

2015-11-23 11:42:18,"Now's a good time to re-examine why the ""war against spoofing"" is a fool's errand.

The best way to look at this is to ask ""Why does spoofing work?""  The answer is simple:  Because there are untold numbers of remoras, hangers-on and other ""get rich quick"" types who think that they can essentially front-run the orders of larger players in order to make a quick buck.

After all, what's the big deal here?  The complaint is that some participants are flashing large orders on one side of the trade, causing other players to jump in ahead of a large - but false - bid or ask.  Once this is done, the spoofer quickly reverses and stuffs those people who thought that they were going to earn a couple ticks off a bigger player.

I have absolutely no sympathy for people fooled by the mirage of false bid or ask indications (full disclosure:  I've acted as an institutional trader - both on the sell side and buy side - in the past, as well as having programmed and maintained algorithmic strategies).  If your strategy depends on running ahead of big orders, what are you really adding here?

I was taught very early in my sell side career as a market maker how to mislead, obfuscate and otherwise be as cunning as possible when moving around in the market.  Basic examples included hanging out on the offer with my firm's moniker with small amounts of stock, while sitting on the bid using an ECN buying the stock I really needed.  It was hard to believe you could convince people to sell just because you were representing as a seller, but hey - it worked.  I had to do what was necessary for my clients.

So let's ask ourselves:  Who are we carrying water here for, exactly?  If you've done your research on a stock (or other issue), then choose a price, submit a limit order, and wait for a fill.  Spoofing will have zero effect on you.  If you're too clever by half, and you think that you can scalp a quick buck because you're ""more nimble"" than those bigger players out there, then you deserve to get run over."

Technology in trading is used to solve problems you *currently* have.. it's a tool, nothing more. 

If your a beginner, what problem could you be currently having that is solved by more screen real estate? Isn't your current task at  hand just to learn and grow, and become profitable though your own skill, and not miss-attribute gains to your own ability instead of luck or a bull market?

Focus first on being profitable.. using just your laptop if possible. Once you discover a bottleneck that prevents you from making more than you already are (notice I didn't say makes you profitable in the first place,) then solve it with whatever tools make sense to do so.

Or fuck it, don't listen to me, buy the monitors.. more monitors; more money, right?

truthfully -- and this is just my own personal experience here on this sub /u/speederaser but i do genuinely feel part of the reason why this sub has much less contributions (content/comments/etc) from its regular posters is one of two things-

* 1) and this is a biggie imho -- but the constant downvoting of legit quality posts from other members who always seem to come out of the woodwork on this sub, whether its a t/a related post, or a question from a noob, seem to always get downvoted to the ground for whatever the reason ... and it can be quite discouraging especially when you've put in a good deal amount of effort into that said post, only to see it get downvoted to absolutely nothing ... for an example, i was fixing to put up a few charts &amp; commentary myself of what i was seeing this weekend as far as the markets were concerned, but i immediately thought otherwise as i knew it would make the downvote rounds yet again, so i just said ""forget it"" and moved on and never did make that post ...

* 2) see reason #1 lol ... no j/k ... i think the second reason might be because this sub does get a lot of blogspam as /u/kevinstonge mentioned in his post there ... it can be kind of irritating imo at times trying to sift through this, and finding the more ""opinion"" post from members ... albeit it has been few and far between as of late ... but i would say that is another reason for the less comments and what have you

this sub doesn't really get as much attention as some others, but i actually don't mind the close-knit community that we have here ... sometimes quality over quantity ain't such a bad thing imho ... albeit i can't say that we've been getting too much of that lately either haha ... j/k

but seriously, i would personally refer to #1 of my reasons why this sub just doesn't get much in the way of contributions from its regular members anymore

it has definitely had a profound affect on me personally, as i already mentioned that i decided against making a detailed market post this weekend because of all the downvoting shenanigans that goes on here on a daily basis ... oh well it is what it is what can you do

but, i do appreciate those of you out there who still do contribute here on a daily basis whether its in the form of a new reddit thread, or just a comment within a thread ... keep up the good work everyone! :)"

Worse, banks have bankrolled with high expectations of profits US oil entrepreneurs who invest millions in tight shale fracturing oil wells who now will not be able to repay the banks, the investors and therefore oil stocks, banks, investors, and retired people and 401K owners will all suffer.

2016-02-25 06:15:47,"Crude oil is a commodity. As such the best way to invest long term in crude, you should focus on companies that produce crude oil. For example, Exxon in the US, BP in England, Royal Dutch Shell etc. If you are betting that the price of crude oil will go up in the future, then you should buy shares of these companies. As the oil prices increase so does the profits of these companies and so does their share prices.
The other way is an indirect one. For example, as the oil boom happens the demand for the ancillary services increase too. i.e. Exploration, Refining, Transport etc. And you can also invest in the companies that provide that kind of services.

That said I'm doing ok right now, with my portfolio up by 23% so far this month. If I knew more, maybe it would be more, maybe it would be less. Just so much more to learn "
2016-02-24 20:02:38,"The answer to your question depends on the regime in which things are trading. 

What we call no man's land is the narrow window where long term support meets long term resistance. It's very hard to day trade it, green bar, red bar, green bar kind of days. So the goal here isn't to be right it's to know the tight trading range and trust that it's not going anywhere yet and use the bad days to lower your overall entry price if you need to.

So flat trading week around a key price point (1925 being the 50% fib on the down move), you can expect price to hang here for a while while algos play a giant game of chicken as to who buckles first. 50% fibs are so important. So I will trust that any break from here will be violent to one direction. +/- 50 pts violent. These +/- 20 pts are just daily noise factoring in a bunch of things

However... in a clearly trending day, up or down, yes you are right by ALL MEANS take your loss and get out. But it's very easy to know the difference. A trend usually has more than one data point supporting it ;)  If you are long, and there are two red bar days, probably are on the wrong side. 

That initial trade I closed out on Tuesday morning I believe after the Saudi oil minister spoke about not cutting production rates. I needed to gauge how bad the markets were going to react to it so I went cash and just took my profits. But all the while in our chat we were eyeballing that 1890 support and using it as the place to consider getting back in. I was still being cautious, so I didn't play that and instead I waited for the gap down to fill intraday, cross 1920, and then I entered long there SPXL and in few other things. It's a small position but I bet small when uncertainty is high so I can add more if right, or average in if there's a red day, and I'll exit a long if that green line breaks to the downside or we lose 1890's as support.

Stops: when there is an active support and I'm long, I'm trailing just below the green sloped lines (on my chart they are green) with a mental stop. I don't use stop loss orders at all if I can avoid them because you never know when some predatory algo will wipe a thin bid and stop you before the price continues up. Manual is better the way I trade, and when my mental stop is crossed I fire off a market order while day trading using a mental stop (I trade liquid stuff, so I don't care about the one tick loss in a market order...I'll sacrifice that for speed to be first out)

Position size as % of account varies. In no man's land, I'm not betting big on day trades. 10-20% or less of total account to just play with and use the rest to build positions for a breakout or to average into better entries for swings. But in clear and definitive trends with a clear trend line and support/resistance leading the trade, I won't lie I'm pretty much almost all in in a combination of things. But if you use those lines as stops and you have a rock solid entry, your safety net should keep you from losing much at all if wrong. But it takes patience and experience to get to a point to feel safe with a support/resistance style of trading. I don't recommend this to anyone just getting into trading. Start small and grow into your comfort level based on what you are willing to risk. Maybe 10%, then if that works try 15%, then 20%, etc. Grow into something comfortable for you... 

This inspired me to write something down the road about all these questions. Position sizing and all that is a very personal thing and it will vary from person to person, and there is no right answer for this. It's all about who you are and how you handle risk. Thanks for the questions!

So I'm interested in the position size (like % of acct) and how you arrived at it for the initial trade at 1920 (which if I understand correctly was on 2/19).

"
2016-02-24 17:05:45,"&gt;There really is no indication oil will bounce back. There's no reason oil needs to go up at all, any more than there's a reason oil will go lower.
 
Right now oil is cheap because OPEC is trying to put all the NA shale oil producers out of business.  Eventually they are going to stop doing this, and the price will rise back up.  "
2016-02-24 17:01:53,"I think the recent growth (particularly it outpacing the market), has been people fleeing other less solid solar stocks like SCTY, SUNE, VSLR, and others. The solar stock market had a bunch of great buys early last year, and as soon a congress renewed the FITC late last year. However now a bunch have had questionable Q4 earning reports and a lot of companies have been having business model and structural issues as they get bigger (SUNE &amp; SCTY). This all being said I think FSLR is definitely a buy for a long hold right now. Although I might wait a few days, lately FSLR has been very variable day to day so you might be able to get a better price then 69.45. Long term I am very bullish, the solar outlook projections are looking great and FSLR is definitely one of the more solid companies out there both in their business model and structure. Short term it really depends on oil, and the market overall, I have only see FSLR go up once on a down day in the last 2 months. IF you are interested in Solar, you could always follow buffet and invest in SPWR, but I also really like TAN (Guggenheim Solar ETF) if you like the ETFs. VSLR is also another one you can pick up real cheap right now, it probably wont have quite the returns but it is still a good long hold. Actually for the long term the only Solar stock I would not by right now is SUNE. "

2016-02-24 16:14:16,"Yes, 2x and 3x etfs are leveraged. The (#)(x) is the leveraged amount, so 2x is two time leverage, meaning whatever it follows it will be roughly 2times that percentage. And yes they do have time decay, in which these etfs are technically designed to go to zero since they reset daily. The time decay main occurs from the ups and down of these stocks. For example, the normal etf (non leveraged) will go up 25 percent one day and down 20 the next day. (1 + 0.25) x (1 - 0.2) = 1. In the case of an leveraged etf, (say 2x and it tracks the same thing the normal etf tracks), it goes up 50 percent one day and down 40 the next. (1 + 0.5) x (1 - 0.4) = .9 .

2016-02-24 16:02:52,DWTI is the opposite of UWTI...
2016-02-24 15:59:40,"It's the opportunity cost. Let's assume the reason that oil is so low is irrational (it isn't), the market can stay irrational far longer than you can stay solvent. 

Let's even assume you have your $20,000 invested in all the big oil players so there's little chance that they'll go bankrupt or something. You're entire investment is based on the premise that if oil went down, oil must go up, so ipso facto oil stocks must go up. When you think about it rationally there's no way to know if oil will go back up, there's no reason to believe wherever you invest your money that the stock is going to move in tandem to oil. 

Investing in oil based on it's price is a speculation play, speculation is typically best used to take advantage of short-term volatility. Speculating with oil stocks as a long-term investment is a good way to miss out on all the other growth opportunities that exist in the market. 

Edit: You can be invested in oil stocks because of a variety of factors, often the price of oil will weigh strongly on the share price. But that should only be one of many factors in why you decide to invest in any one company."

2016-02-24 11:20:03,"I agree.  This will be a long drawn out bankruptcy-fest.  One by one, many of the smaller drillers will go bankrupt.  I also think oil briefly touches $20 share.  There are still sooooo many traders and hopefuls thinking there will be a V-bottom.  It is not going to happen.  The oil crisis effects so many other sectors and, frankly, it could easily bring us down into a recession.  Also, there is so much oil related bank debt that will need to be written down, so you will see banks having horrible quarters for a few quarters in a row.  Its going to be a LOOONNNGGG process."
2016-02-24 10:39:44,"In summary, Although laws differ hugely from country to country, the concept of equity crowdfunding is essentially about allowing everyday people to invest in early-stage companies for small amounts of money, in exchange for a percentage of the company they are investing in.
The company gets an increase in capital to run and grow their business. The investor will (hopefully) make their money back if the company goes on to grow and exit for a large amount."
2016-02-24 10:32:03,"i agree with you.
The last time oil saw $20 a barrel was late 2003. There are two factors that are pressing the price down. The continuing glut on oil supplies, most producers are still producing and the strengthening US dollar Is starting to be a factor. Its very difficult to predict the absolute bottom. I remember vividly a relative throwing most of his remaining investment portfolio into oil at the beginning of this downward slide as he adamantly proclaimed that the world will never see $50 oil again. I usually am a contrarian. As more and more people are predicting a continuing fall to '$20 we may be nearing the bottom. Then again we may not.
not sure though.."
2016-02-24 10:31:37,"Depends on what kind of bottom you are looking for.

From what most of the oil guys I am hearing from, its going to be a longer drawn out low rather than some sort of V bottom."
2016-02-24 10:20:15," the regulations in each country vary greatly country to country, and as this is a new type of financial instrument/tool, a lot of countries have yet to catch on. Typical regulatory regime's are quite conservative in the way they restrict accessibility to equity investment, for example, here in the Philippines, without getting into complicated legal structuring, typically only QIBs are allowed to directly purchase a stake within a company (that's your equity), and, by my last calculation that's roughly 4 ten thousandths of a percent of the population. In the US until Title III, accredited investors were typically the only ones allowed to participate, that was people who earned greater than USD200,000 per annum or had a net worth greater than USD1 Million (how well that correlated to how financially sophisticated they were, I'm not entirely sure). Now it's this (directly lifted off the SEC website):
Permit individual investors, over a 12-month period, to invest in the aggregate across all crowdfunding offerings up to: If either their annual income or net worth is less than $100,000, than the greater of: $2,000 or 5 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth. If both their annual income and net worth are equal to or more than $100,000, 10 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth; and
During the 12-month period, the aggregate amount of securities sold to an investor through all crowdfunding offerings may not exceed $100,000.
Talking about equity crowdfunding in more detail, it is a subset of crowdfunding and equity investment, and it encompasses two concepts: the type of investment &amp; the source of funds. Equity is simply the type/percentage of the asset you are directly purchasing (Equity Definition) and can encompass a variety of forms, for example, technically, what we're doing at RET.asia-(Home) is equity crowdfunding, but the type of asset you would be purchasing would be real estate as opposed to an early stage company. Crowdfunding is a very old method of sourcing funds - a wide, and highly retail aggregation of funds, typically involving the Internet, but, not necessarily, for example, did you know this -The Statue of Liberty and America's crowdfunding pioneer - BBC News (there are actually instances of crowdfunding that predate this, but you get the point). I guess, in that sense, publicly listed companies issuing stocks is a form of equity crowdfunding.
In terms of how it works, if we take early stage companies as what you're attempting to crowdfund/invest in, then you, along with dozens, hundreds or thousands of others (hence, ""crowd"") would be exchanging capital for a direct stake in that company. You would, in essence, be an ""owner"" although, probably limited in what rights you could exercise with that ownership stake. It's basically like small scale private equity investment, or inversely, giving access to private equity investment to those who previously could not afford to access it on a larger scale. What the exit or payoff is depends on the offering at hand, but if your getting into an early stage company I would guess the goal would be to sell your stake later for a higher amount, once the said company has increased in value, whether to other early stage, private equity investors, or, as is always the dream, should it go IPO. It's almost like being a mini-VC (lol). That being said, if this is something you are seriously contemplating doing, due diligence is everything, as equity crowdfunding is not yet a mature channel of investment, many platforms lack rigorous processes, usually to ease deal flow, but it means a greater level of uncertainty on your part, and, usually there's no protection or insurance on your principal investment. Do your homework, and, as always, understand that this is a high risk investment."

And companies that do primarily exploration will be fucked for a long time.  Like 10 years.

They have the supply to keep oil where its at and even push it ~25% lower to cause the producers whos costs are &gt;$50/barrel to go under.  This is going to be a pretty long term thing."

2016-02-24 00:59:45,"It all depends on how long you want to hold onto these stocks, long term (&gt;than a year) or short term. There are many parts of the oil sector that one can invest in, such as refineries, exploration, drilling, transportation and storage. Some of the large companies that I can think of that are great to look at for the long term are $XOM, $CVX, 
$VLO, $BP, $RDA.A. Some companies that deal with transportation of storage would be $KMI, $KNOP, and $SE. You can look through a stock scanner for a full list of these companies. Personally, I would invest in larger companies since they tend to be able to be better long term investments, without the worry of bankruptcy in this current economy. "

2016-06-01 15:51:32,"Congrats, all. Is there a June contest and what are the rules?"
2016-06-01 15:49:50,"I can't speak for other brokers, but I used TD Ameritrade and at the time I was trading, they offered a 10 second execution guarantee on the usual big markets.  If your order didn't get executed, they would reimburse you the difference that you would have gotten if it had.  
  
But you were on your own down in the penny / OTC land.  Sometimes orders got executed in decent time and sometimes they didn't.  I ended up getting out of the OTC market for that reason.  When you can't even trust that your orders will get executed with any regularity then any trading strategy you have goes right out the window.  
  
To answer your question tho, I guess it depends what you define as real latency.  With the markets going mostly electronic these days I don't think you will have any real human-ish latency (I would say 10s or less), but you'll have to take that with a grain of salt.  I heard a stat recently that said something like 80% of trading now is algorithmic, or HFT programs trading with each other, so you're talking nanoseconds."
2016-06-01 15:44:43,"Good point! I personally am still to create a real account on a brokage site but after reding that I'm deffenetly going to do some reserch before I start for real.
Is execution latency a big thing even on the bigger sites and brokers?"
2016-06-01 15:37:27,"I used to trade the pennys and I did OK profit-wise for a while.  
  
That being said, one thing I have never seen mentioned here is that as far as I know, no broker is going to guarantee execution when trading OTC / pennys. Because of this, it's simple to paper trade.  Your order gets executed immediately at exactly the price you intended so it's easy to make a boatload of money...  
  
Back in the real world where there's no order execution guarantee and the OTC market is riddled with corruption and manipulation, you'll submit your order and watch it sit there on the desk not being executed minute after minute as your profits quickly slip away.  
  
Someone can feel free to correct me if there's a brokerage out there that guarantees execution on the OTC market."
2016-06-01 15:33:58,"Theres no way to know what types of numbers stocks will do. If it was so easy to calculate how all penny stocks moved we would all win, but we can't all win.

Just be careful and realize that you cant know that there is an 80% chance you will win."

2016-06-01 15:28:56,OK. Did't mean to come across defensive. After all I'm the one who doesent know shit. Still tho lets say the stock goes up 80% of the time an we win average of 15% and the times it goes down we manage to sell at -20% don't we still come out with positive bottomline?

Mortimer Duke: This is not a *meal*, Valentine. We are here to TRY to explain to you what is we do here.  
Randolph Duke: We are 'commodities brokers', William. Now, what are commodities? Commodities are agricultural products... like coffee that you had for breakfast... wheat, which is used to make bread... pork bellies, which is used to make bacon, which you might find in a 'bacon and lettuce and tomato' sandwich.  
[Billy Ray turns and gives a long look at the camera]  
Randolph Duke: Randolph  
[continuing]  
Randolph Duke: And then there are other commodities, like frozen orange juice... and GOLD. Though, of course, gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges.  
[chuckles]  
Randolph Duke: Clear so far?  
Billy Ray: [nodding, smiling] Yeah.  
Randolph Duke: Good, William! Now, some of our clients are speculating that the price of gold will rise in the future. And we have other clients who are speculating that the price of gold will fall. They place their orders with us, and we buy or sell their gold for them.  
Mortimer Duke: Tell him the good part.  
Randolph Duke: The good part, William, is that, no matter whether our clients make money or lose money, Duke &amp; Duke get the commissions.  
Mortimer Duke: Well? What do you think, Valentine?

Of course, we never really see this because lots of people are still holding stock, but if everyone tried to convert stock to cash at once, the overall total since the start of the stock market would be zero."

2016-06-01 04:16:24,"There are water markets that you may be able to invest in. 

It depends where you are though. There are water markets in Australia, Chile, Caifornia (I think) and (this is a really vague one) Colarado.

You'll have to check out local conditions about investing: if you need to be a reident of the state, own land in the river basin, etc.

I'm Australian, so mot of what follows is based on the Australian experience, but is probably aplicable.

In  Australia water access has been restricted in certain areas and farmers have been given/sold 'water rights' that they can then buy and sell on a water market. 

The idea of this is to give water an economic price. The value of the water rights then fluctuates with the rainfall and the price that farmers are willing to pay for it (which is determind by the value of their crops and the water they use - rice: lots of water, low value; cotton: lots of water, OK value; Wine/Almonds: not much water, high value).

You could buy water rights, and not use the water, but rather hold them because you expect them to increase in value.

Water rights are, however, highly controversial. Everyone thinks water should be free, so they are politically unpopular. Farmers are also often quite politically powerful. So expect more government intervention than in other investment areas."

2016-05-31 20:42:35,"You could triple your account tomorrow and you wouldn't know when to sell. You'd watch that gain turn into a loss and not do anything about it. You'd hold a loss for weeks or months and never see that same sell opportunity again. While all around you the next pump and dumps are going wild. 
Then you'll learn to chase. That's when you become a pro at buying at the very top and selling at the bottom. 
You'll do this for months trying to figure out a consistent method to lose more money while you blow up several accounts. You'll go from being trigger happy to being gun shy. You'll question if you even have an edge or if you're just straight up gambling. 
When you finally decide to quit you'll come on this sub and start talking mad shit about how people shouldn't waste their time.

2016-05-31 16:39:57,"great. this is just to add more to your points. 

**Highlight your achievements to date.**

Demonstrate how far along the path to success you have already come. Have you already secured large, well-known clients? Put their logos in the pitch. Do you have excellent testimonials from your existing customers? Insert direct quotations from these testimonials. Have you received any prestigious industry awards? Make sure your equity crowdfunding pitch refers to them.

**Crunch the numbers**.

You need to show that you have thought carefully about how you expect to use the proceeds of your capital raise to grow the business.

Show the platform the cash generating potential month-by-month and where future cash requirements of the company may be. Financial and operational measures depend entirely on which industry you operate within. Projections should be underpinned by a solid, ambitious-but-realistic financial model.

**Have a lead investor already lined up.**

One of the things that takes many founders by surprise is the need to have a “lead investor” pre-arranged before several of the platforms will let you go live. This lead investor will contribute a sizeable portion of the raise themselves, and gives your offer momentum and validation to the broader crowd.

Whether it’s an absolute requirement for a particular platform or not, it’s always seen as a positive.

**Provide the rationale: why equity crowdfunding?**

Finally, you should explain why you have settled on equity crowdfunding.

Then, explain why it would make a great investment. Remember, the platforms will be thinking “what’s in it for investors” – not why it would be great for you, or for the business.

2016-05-31 16:28:43,"That said, here are the major tips the platforms will use to evaluate an equity crowdfunding campaign.

**Be introduced from someone the platform already knows**.

If the platform hears about you via their networks, it will always be better than if you approach them cold.

**Explain clearly exactly what your business does**

The platforms all lament the inability of founders to quickly and simply articulate what their business does and how it works. This holds especially true if the business is something novel, or operates in the biotech or software space. The pitch can be complemented by bringing along a tangible example of your product, or a live demonstration.

**Show the size of the market**

The platforms love numbers, and the more you can do to demonstrate a large (and hopefully growing) market for whatever it is you offer, the better. Try to find credible third-party estimates for market size – the data can be difficult to find, but the exercise is well worthwhile.

**Convince them why you will succeed**

Given an attractive market, you need to convince the platforms that your company has the potential to succeed in it, or better yet, has an established track record of already succeeding in it. What product categories do you have? Do these product categories match the actual needs of the target market you have identified? Who are the people in your company’s team, and have these people succeeded in this sort of business before? Who are your competitors, and how is your business positioned differently from them? How can your business use its differences to its advantage?
what do you all think?"
2016-05-31 15:49:10,"1) you can write an algo to hook up to their API (IB).
2) if you're making a platform from scratch (you're a hedge fund or HFT guy) you will very likely need to pay for live data. I don't know much about this so I'll refer you to /r/AlgoTrading. 
3) if you're intent on building an entire platform you'll need to code everything of course. 
4) definitely invest in your own server. "

I think its a lot harder for people who start with less as it can be hard to grow your account if you start on a bad run, however i think the above comments are very unfair. Since starting with them i can honestly say they have a win rate of 60-70%+ wit ease which is exactly what you want if you want to make profit! i highly recommend FHT over any other signal provider i have been with, especially as Lee is always there to guide you and has a great response rate which i think other teams struggle with.

2016-05-31 10:11:35,"&gt; This has been tough one for me lately. I still find that cutting losses quickly are what's going to save you from being stubborn, digging your heels, and making the loss much worse. Hell you may even find yourself adding to a losing position and that's really bad. All the while the market is going against you and telling you you are wrong. It could simply be that your timing was wrong. But then how long are you willing to hold a loss for? I consider the opportunity cost. While I'm upside down on one trade there's new opportunity arising somewhere else. That's why I cut my losses quickly.

But wouldnt cutting losses quickly simply be ""buy high,sell low""? I had dozens of trades where my position went down by 10-20%,and I havent done anything. I kept being right in the end mostly. 

Thinking about something a lot and dont doing anything in the end is ,suprisingly, a good thing. "

So if you have a $5,000 account and you buy $10,000 worth of shares that eventually lose value and you ended up selling for $4,000 (a $6,000 loss), then you would owe your brokerage $1,000.

And also, they would have closed your account too.

I suggest to avoid using margin unless you have a proven track record of consistent profits.  It's all about risk management and consistency.

2016-05-29 23:02:14,"It can be rigged. There are players who may be able to spot large institutions who deal with your retirement account or your pension funds when they trade and front run your positions to profit. I am sure it happens. Large players such as pension funds are evolving to fight these kinds of tactics. Take 'Dark Pools' for one. These are stock deals done after hours by large institutions basically to shield themselves from predatory traders.  We are not entirely helpless.  

This premise of efficient markets is mostly theoretical and academic in scope for the most part. There are practical efficiencies  in the markets of all kinds that span the scope of the most liquid stock like BAC to the most illiquid option of some rarely traded stock. The mechanics of the  markets are in place such that if the particular instrument of trade reaches a certain volatility (that is---a demand for supply arises) , efficiency of trade is assured.

I'm happy to report to all of you here that the feedback from this weekly contest this week was extremely positive! Quite a bit of people messaged me this week asking if I would continue on with these weekly contest going forward from here ... and ... well ... I am happy to tell you all -- w/o a doubt HELL YEAH! Lol. Why not? I am all down for making this sub even BETTER and if it means running these weekly stock contest here to get members more engaged into the community here, then let's do this thang! :D


That being said, I will have to tell you all, I am not entirely sure I will be able to run the contest this upcoming week ahead due to the long holiday weekend we have here in the states this weekend. If you didn't know by now, this following Monday is Labor Day here in the states and the U.S. markets are closed.


So, I'm kinda looking ahead to the following week (the week of 9/12 - 9/16) to resume these weekly contests here.


Now, as far as when you guys can expect to see the new contest thread up ... I originally had plans to post 'em up every Sunday's ... however after giving it some more thought, it seems Saturday's would be our best bet as that would give as many members possible the opportunity to see the thread thus getting a chance to post their picks up on the thread before the market opens that week.


As for the TIME of when you can expect said thread to be created ... probably anywhere between the late morning to the early afternoon on Saturday's...


Again, the next contest thread likely wouldn't be up until the week beginning 9/12! This would also be better since EVERYONE presumably should be back from their summer vacation trips and into their trading desks again! :D


I will have posted all the contest rules and all the requirements that would be needed to participate on the contest so don't worry if you missed our last week's thread! They will be reposted on every new contest threads!


Whelp, that's that! Again, I want to take this time to thank all of you who participated this week! It was a great trial run this week on r/StockMarket to see how these contests would do here. I think it was definitely a success on our first ever week.


Happy long Labor Day holiday weekend to all of you in the states! Again, look for the new contest thread sometime on 9/10.


Enjoy this last unofficial week of summer folks! I can't believe how quickly this summer has come and gone! Damn. :O


Take care and be well all,

2016-09-02 17:33:12,"The dividend yield you see on a quote page is the last disbursement annualized as a percentage of the current stock price. Ford paid $0.15 last quarter, so in turn the calculation is (.15 * 4) / $12.46. Most companies that have a common dividend pay it quarterly, but this isn't mandated - they can pay one whenever they want to, as well as freely raise/cut it. 

There are 4 important dates regarding dividends:

1. Declaration Date - This is when the company announces an upcoming dividend. They will specify the disbursement per share ($0.15 for instance), and when it will be recorded.

2. Ex-Dividend Date - In order to be eligible for the declared dividend you must fully hold the stock *before* this date. This is usually two business days before the record date.

Bearish traders are that way and mistake scrutiny with calamity. Dot com crashed because people invested in the internet before the internet was even there (investing in *gebakken lucht*, baked air i.e. nothing). The mortgage crisis caused credit to dry up as bank balances became toxic. 

Now things are far more closely checked by investors. Forget regulation (albeit necessary for certain things), investors are very weary now, with the plethora of information available, prevents the majority of the mega investors (pension funds, etc.) from falling into the same trap.

I am sure that there is a small core of ill gotten gains in this rise, but I'd say it's more from general sophistication (like the Flash Boys mentality of being able to make the fastest trades due to improved tech) and not from faulty growth. 

China is suspect... oil is suspect, and the fact that the banks have been borrowing at 0% since Obama took office is slightly suspect, but I can't see recession hitting in earnest until the boomers begin to fully die off (or spend copious amounts in health care and not on commerce).

""Open"" is indicated to be 4.49, close 4.31. Doing that math that implies a change of -4.01%, yet Google Finance says -3.79%. 

The disparity is due to rounding - there are more than two decimal places in a share price (I'm not sure exactly what it is). So there was probably thousandths present in the change and opening price.

If you want to replicate the -3.79% you can add the dollar change to the closing price to get the implied opening price, then divide accordingly:

4.31 / (4.31 + 0.17) = 3.79%

mine doesn't require a ""rationale"" ... but i have been contemplating maybe making that as a requirement in future contests ... nothing as of yet though

and unlike his, i use a live updated spreadsheet where everyone can view their picks and their performance in real-time

suffice to say i think mine are at least slightly better than his lol :p

Example: I would have sold BRK.A in 2009 then trailed SP500 returns for 10-Year measure.

BRK.A 2009 performance was far below SP500 with 2.69% vs. 26.46% for SP500.

It has beaten SP500 for YTD, 1-Year, 10-Year, and 15-Year.  It trails in the 5-Year measure.

Annual declines for BRK.A in 2001 and 2008 are the only ones in its long term record.

Reasons why to consider diversifying beyond just this one investment is that its insurance operations face highly cyclical markets, longevity of WB who may be key.  

Jeremy Siegel advocated allocating part of portfolio to BRK.A/B in his writings, as well as sector strategy allocations to Cons Staples, Energy, and Branded Pharma.  This along with a diversified World Stock fund.

TL;DR, long track record, but why not diversify?

2015-02-11 08:47:04,That is the odds favorite right now.  
2015-02-11 08:45:14,Could APPL be the first Trillion Dollar company???
2015-02-11 08:21:31,Dividends aren't the only means of rewarding shareholders. Berkshire Hathaway famously never offers dividends and still manages to consistently increase shareholder value through buybacks.
2015-02-11 07:53:35,You're right! I stand corrected.
2015-02-11 07:49:09,I don't follow.   AAPL has a dividend.
2015-02-11 07:46:07,"I bet all those AAPL shareholders are excited about the dividends! Oh wait...

Edit: I'm an idiot. AAPL pays dividends. Carry on."
2015-02-11 03:59:10,"I'm finally into $AAPL since after the latest ER at around $116 and my short term target is $130!
It could even go much higher during the year depending on how well the new products are received.
Just my 2 cents ;)

BTW I'm holding both AAPL and BBRY :P
Both winner to me."
2015-02-11 03:54:00,"I'm still patiently holding shares since $7 and $9. Something different must happen, John Chen is a nice CEO and the company has lots of assets and even cash to successfully complete a turnaround probably more focused on software than the hardware side.
Let's see the next results at the end of March ;)"
2015-02-10 20:40:13,"15 cents for every $100. So, probably receive roughly 45 cents per transaction. This isn't that big, but making headway to get more people using is always a good thing."
2015-02-10 18:01:16,I hope it goes back to 100! :( yeah I got $100 worth of shares today
2015-02-10 15:39:45,"Trefis estimate is that 56.7% of AAPL's market cap is iPhone.

The problem with your only sales being based on your ""cool"" factor is that as soon as you're not ""cool"", you're dead."
2015-02-10 15:30:38,"Wow, weak reply. Also, I don't own any AAPL, and there's no reason a company can't be *both* a tech and fashion company. Apparently if you do it right it's really profitable."
2015-02-10 15:27:43,"LMAO, it's bad enough that you're an Apple fan boy. It's worse that you let your biases cloud your financial judgement. Apple is a fashion company, not tech."
2015-02-10 15:26:00,"Are you typing these responses on your Blackberry, or maybe your Windows XP Tablet PC Edition? You're being ridiculous if you're going to pretend the iPhone didn't *radically* change the phone industry, or that the iPad ""rehashed"" the non-existent tablet market."
2015-02-10 15:21:31,"&gt; They claim to have a proprietary algorithm that they use to create the list.

How do you use an algorithm with something so subjective? List is garbage. I quit after seeing Google get the mention for Chromebook."
2015-02-10 15:14:03,&gt;  iCloud hack was made possible because **Apple allowed** unlimited password attempts.
2015-02-10 15:13:18,"lol, Apple doesn't innovate anything at all. If you think the iPod, iPhone, iMac, or iPad are anything besides rehashing an existing market, you're a fool."
2015-02-10 14:44:24,"iCloud hack was different. It had a slightly different.....end-user interaction. iCloud hack was made possible because Apple allowed unlimited (or a really high number, I don't remember exactly) password attemps. So someone just ran a dictionary of passwords (compiled from other user-name password leaks) against a set of usernames until they got in.  

In case of ApplePay, since the processing is done by the bank, it should be more secure."
2015-02-10 14:02:38,Blackberry has a far better chance of being bought than RadioShack had .  not saying its going to happen.

Apple's implementation actually is new and unique, but it works with existing standards-compliant equipment. What exactly are you complaining about? "

2015-02-10 11:42:51,"I watched it fall over the years from $100+, never touched it and don't plan to."

2015-02-10 11:33:56,"Mhhm, it's working out so great for PayPal.

Once again, Apple fails to create anything new and simply makes their own label for what already exists."
2015-02-10 11:33:05,"The iCloud hack was total ignorance of Best Practices. Sorry, but just because Apple reinvents the wheel doesn't it's instantly gold."
2015-02-10 11:15:34,"The big deal with Apple Pay is that it's not actually an alternative to credit cards but merely a replacement for the *physical* card. They're not trying to remake the payments industry, and it doesn't require anything special from the merchant. It just works with normal hardware that they either already have, or soon will regardless. "
2015-02-10 11:13:01,"I think you misunderstand how it works. Apple doesn't store your card number as part of Apple Pay. They don't store your token either. The token is stored on your phone and sent by your phone to the merchant who sends it up their processing network where it is finally mapped back to your real account number in a token vault maintained either by your bank or Visa/MC on behalf of the bank (it's a service they offer).

And for what it's worth, Apple has successfully stored credit card numbers as part of iTunes for over a decade, with no breaches. (The iCloud ""hack"" was a combination of social engineering and good guesses for bad passwords. It's not even remotely relevant.)"
2015-02-10 10:52:31,"I'm so glad Apple has demonstrated they're immune from breaches.


Honestly, more centralization of that data just makes it all the more attractive for attackers."
2015-02-10 10:51:04,"Holy hype! Who cares about Apple Pay? The market's grossly saturated with ""alternative"" payment methods. PayPal's been doing it for years, I don't see them taking over credit cards."
2015-02-10 10:08:35,"&gt; Security and convenience. You already are holding your phone when walking up to the counter to checkup. You place your phone on this device, place your finger on the fingerprint sensor and that is it. Suppose to be the same with Apple watch but I don't know how the lack of fingerprint sensor is going to be handled. Have a couple of ideas but have not seen anything official.
&gt; Devils advocate. Where I live they do not require signature for most credit card purchases any longer. Plus, I do not personally see any savings from better security. It is true I have to pull out my wallet.

"
2015-02-10 10:06:02,devil stock. probably one of my biggest loss ever was in that name. 
2015-02-10 09:41:19,POS. Did a big dilution not too long ago and if you look at the 5 minute chart it looks like some serious bot trading.
2015-02-10 09:41:14,"Noticed that Apple and Google were both in the top 5.   But thought weird that Amazon was missing from the list all together.

They claim to have a proprietary algorithm that they use to create the list."
2015-02-10 09:12:39,"&gt; doesn't seem to be anything new or a real improvement over using a cc.

Simple version: The huge difference is that when you use Apple Pay, the merchant never gets your real credit card number. That way, when there is a breach at the merchant, your account is still safe. "
2015-02-10 09:10:26,"&gt; The big battle that they have in front of them is the signing up of merchants and websites that accept apple pay.

Physical merchants don't have to sign up for Apple Pay. They just need a functioning industry-standard NFC terminal, which most will have within a year anyway, since new EMV/chip terminals almost all come with NFC support. 
"
2015-02-10 09:06:05,"The whole 'hype' is about ease of use. The argument is people will find it very easy to pay using their phone rather than a credit card. It does have some merit as all the new iphones come with finger print recognition so you don't have to sign a credit card receipt or enter any pincode etc (at least that is in theory). The big battle that they have in front of them is the signing up of merchants and websites that accept apple pay. Paypal is miles ahead in that department. But the business has billions of dollars potential and knowing apple and their bullying ways, they will try to elbow out everyone. Ebay (owners of Paypal) price was very hard hit when apple announced its intention to enter into payments market. Now EBay has agreed to spin off paypal to let them fight the battle on their own without the EBay baggage."
2015-02-10 08:34:55,"The more time that goes by without a transaction the less value, IMO.

2015-02-10 05:43:27,"Looks like Apple keeps chugging along with Apple Pay.

The real question is what does this really mean from a stock standpoint?   Is it only about increasing value of the ecosystem?   Or can it generate a meaningful revenue stream of it's own?  "

2015-02-09 01:09:28,"Doubtful. It's usually more ""Pushing out those with stops"" that is more likely. Often people will ser their stops just below certain trigger points on a chart. Pushing it to that point triggers a sale and all of a sudden big volume rushes and the stock price takes a huge dive. 

Then it's picked up for an easy trade. It just so happens that retail isn't focusing all the time and often they'll sell and miss the rise back up. 

This volatility typically ""shakes out the weak hands"" and the weak hands are typically retail. So it's not a target of retail, but more of a byproduct imo. "

2016-12-09 16:09:18,"By the time personal investors like you or me get the fundamental information on why a stock went down is usually too late. And frankly we don't need to know. Personally all I care is if price is going up or down. If you look at the monthly chart for $SGMO you'll see that it peaked in February 2014 when it hit resistance after testing highs from 2007. After that it was making lower highs and the 200-day moving average started to decline. Price action for the stock has been in a downtrend since 2014. That's all I need to know.

Even if the company was doing great I wouldn't dream of opening a long position in the stock until the price action confirms that the downtrend has reversed and the odds are in my favor."

Mostly I believe that the overall market trend will be dictated by fundamentals of the economy.  Good economy good market, bad economy falling market.  It is possible to profit in both directions even if profits in a down market have managed to mostly elude me. :-)   For overall market try to understand the economic cycle of expansion/contraction and which industries do well in certain points of the cycle.  Understanding that will make ETF's a little more understandable and also will make good investment alternatives to single stocks as you learn"
2016-12-08 15:00:05,This looks like it gapped down on the last earnings report which was a miss.

Well, it wouldn't be a *great* idea to do this. At least do a little research if you're going to buy individual stocks. But if you truly want to put in as little effort as possible, look to mutual funds, ETFs, or index funds. These are much better for the ""set it and forget it"" style of investing. You'll still want to check in every so often to make sure the returns are decent and the sectors/companies invested in are in good shape, but it's a lot less work than going after individual stocks.

As for portfolio diversity, it can be good, but it can also be detrimental. There's certain companies/sectors that have an inverse relationship, meaning when one goes up, the other goes down. It doesn't make sense to carry both, so be wary of that when doing your DD."

Holding any stock for 30 years might actually be insane. Though, if you look at any stocks history, most always went up, because u always will just see the ones which survived at the market so far.

2017-03-12 19:15:33,I think his goal is to build Weyland Corp. I predict that Tesla will merge with Mitsubishi in the next 100 years after Elon dies in some crazy space adventure.
2017-03-12 18:45:41,tsla is so hard to value because its all research dependent for there future. they already make money but elon has spent all that and then some. that said he spent it on what could literally be the future(hopefully). the solar roof could be insane and so many other things. that said he is like howard hughes and his supernatural ambition could be his undoing only time will tell. me personally im bullish
2017-03-12 18:42:03,it is a very good long term stock indeed
2017-03-12 18:41:19,Ragefan66 do u wanna be a alternate if the others do not pick in time????
2017-03-12 18:39:18,and the fed rate increase is the biggest macro catalyst this week for sure no matter what anyone says! the market has anticipated it for some time so maybe only a little down the day of the announcement. of course if they didn't do it (only like 10% odds) the market will freaking explode thats for sure lol(once again probably not gonna happen)
2017-03-12 18:36:32,me personally i think the banks will fair very well with impending fed rate increase as compared to non financial businesses
2017-03-12 18:35:19,I plan to hold my JNJ  for 10 years. Maybe 20. Why would you ever sell? It's literally one of the greatest companies on earth.
2017-03-12 18:29:22,"$CRBP long - they have conference early in the week and a small chance they annouce some really good stuff!

$AUPH long- just gotta do it she is the horse that won me the last two weeks. be careful buying into it this week as it has been on a epic run, but still has one guaranteed catalyst in aurion study 48w data due q1 (so in march). also potential partnership announcement any time(speculation). that said it has went crazy lately so could go either way"
2017-03-12 18:23:04,i like both picks!
2017-03-12 18:20:07,tenx would be my first pick they are presenting data march 19 for sure dont go heavy though as all penny inherently have risk. also consider PLX i have traded it well recently and data is due anytime q1 so before 31 could be another big catalyst!!! never go big on penny though they are small stack investments!!!! (though they can be good small stack inv))
2017-03-12 17:38:11,"I'm not saying it's the same, I'm saying the appeal to populism ""if it's so bad why did people invest in it"" argument isn't legitimate."
2017-03-12 17:29:59,Do you think it's a decent time to buy BAC now or do you think she's gonna dip below 24 at some point in the near future?
2017-03-12 16:39:41,"Chart looks like it's formed a base, what is coming up for HSGX? "
2017-03-12 16:38:42,Not if it is already priced in. I've been reading that the last few rate hikes corresponded with lows in the price of gold. $1200 is a pretty strong resistance level.
2017-03-12 16:05:07,$FMSA currently at $7.40 put this one on your watch list not saying buy it now as it might go down further. It lost about 41% since 22nd Feb on a scare that the oil price going lower will reduce the number of frackers. $FMSA does fracking sand to oil rigs also to natural gas rigs also sell sand for industrial uses.  So you watch the price and the Baker Hughes rig count stats and the oil price also a competitor $SND has earnings results coming out this week so you check those as well. You look for volumes with the price going up. One person buying a lousy share in the AH counts for nothing. Good luck....
2017-03-12 15:33:07,It's actually running on a loss now. I mean the NPV of SNAP is still reading -$. but isn't that how many businesses start?
2017-03-12 15:30:25,But this is totally not thesame. Or do you really see SNAP that bad?  com on man!!
2017-03-12 15:28:34,"Well, even if there is fear around the stock, it would not start in a downward movement. People recognize that and invested. Now they are cashing out and shorting the stock. 

However, I don't write SNAP off. "
2017-03-12 15:16:34,What would you bet on under 2$ stocks
2017-03-12 14:43:09,"$AMD Long - sp500 hype! They just got added into S&amp;P500 so I think they'll rally all week. That along with Vega + Naples leaks.

$BAC Long - Rate hikes. $BAC will benefit the most from this due to having the most bank accounts"
2017-03-12 13:52:41,Or you can buy 1oz bullion on Ebay for $1200 each. :) 
2017-03-12 13:48:24,"I mostly buy ETFs. Look at GLD and UGLD. UGLD is a 3X, meaning that it is leveraged to match 3X the gold price movement. There are also inverse or short ETFs that let you profit when the price falls, DGLD is a 3X inverse. You can also invest in individual companies affected by the gold value, or a gold miner ETF. "

2017-06-04 02:52:10,"Thanks, i see proshares on thursday but i can't find the ticker symbol anywhere.

Do you know it by chance?"
2017-06-03 23:16:47,"The only thing that's going to stop this bull run is a huge bank run. When people lose confidence, that's when we're fucked. Until then, the market is just going to keep eating shorts' money"
2017-06-03 17:32:33,"Personally I think some are, but just a tad bit. I buy long term. Democrat or Republican, we are always going to be buying military hardware and Trump specifically wants to spend more on the military. And the world isn't getting safer or calmer anytime soon"
2017-06-03 16:35:09,"I think CHK will end up doing well but its debt load keeps me from investing. SWN will likely be very profitable over the next years. 

I only one one exploration and production company at the moment Chinook Energy and it's based in Calgary Cannada. It's essentially debt free and trading at an astronomically low valuation. 

I'm not ready to invest in other exploration and productions companies yet. Due to the unknown variables. I hold Midstream MLP's because it doesn't matter what Natural Gas prices are and I'm very content collecting the dividends. I think the best bet for taking advantage of Natural Gas MLP's is CBA. 

Kind of like more money was made off the gold rush by selling picks and shovels (services) than finding gold. 

The link I posted above goes into depth if you are interested. "
2017-06-03 16:00:53,"Same here ... I've thought many times the last couple years ""This is it! SPY is gonna be in the shitter when I wake up!"" 

Grexit, Brexit, US elections, French elections, Trump shenanigans and stupidity ... the list goes on and on. Clickbaity websites spread panic, people ready clickbait headlines and sell sell sell for one day, then smart money buys the dip and off we go again. 

IMO the only thing that will derail this bull run is an extended series of economically/politically devastating news items released over a series of months with no resolutions. I wouldn't be surprised even if Comey reveals something serious to see SPY tank for a few days and then rebound to all time highs. 

As a fairly heavy short seller, I wish it would just die already. 2008 style, blood in the streets and panic, bring it on! Hehe :) "
2017-06-03 15:43:24,Specifically which of the shale plays do you think will do well? I was considering those plays but haven't had the time to do much digging.
2017-06-03 15:12:15,"I really don't think we view things that differently. I don't buy blue chips, not that there is anything wrong with them. I've made my money on undervalued and underfollowed stocks and ETFs. Primarily ones that are mispriced due to either something to be overcome or being misunderstood. 

To clarify something, I don't believe I'm an all knowing investor. I lost $30,000 in 2015 - 2016 on a misplaced ""bets"" on the price of oil and how long it would remain down. I didn't think there was any way it would stay as low as long as it did. I had companies like Key Energy, Breitburn Energy, SDRL, North Atlantic Drilling, Linn Energy, Penn Virginia to name some of my disasters. I also lost money in 2009 on Storm Cat Energy. But I learned a tremendous amount. 

Therefore I have evolved my strategies. I will never bet on multiple variables again. My mistake was trying to predict price and a timeframe at the same time. 

I just breakdown oil and gas into many different sectors. Some sectors are not profitable while other's are such as Midstream MLP's. 

On commercial REIT's, if I am right, there is a lot of money to be made because in with WPG and CBL.  "

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-bracing-for-potentially-the-most-explosive-stretch-of-trading-this-year-2017-06-03

^ ^ clickbait

and ya i agree with sj-e ... not expecting anything ""explosive"" from comey either

if it's already something we know about it probably won't have much of an impact

tell us something we don't know about already (cue black swan) then *maybe* we have something

otherwise it's just rinse and repeat

thanks for quoting the first paragraph sj-e as i didn't bother to click on the clickbait lol"
2017-06-03 13:24:04,"Walmart's fine (I own it) and is actively setting itself up to be an online competitor of Amazon (not terribly bullish on that but it's a much better play than a company like Target). Grocery stores aren't going anywhere, but department stores are on the way out and malls are going to suffer big time. 

I agree the *right* oil stocks can do well over the next few years, but the sector as a whole is going to have a tough time with lower prices for the foreseeable future."
2017-06-03 12:47:26,"For those too lazy to click, first paragraph reads:

&gt;The stock market could face its most turbulent week of trading so far this year, with a trio of potentially destabilizing events on deck: former FBI director James Comey’s testimony, the U.K. election, and the ECB monetary-policy meeting. The trifecta, coming nearly all simultaneously on June 8, threaten to derail U.S. equities’ record-setting run.

As much as I would love to see some big swings, Im not holding my breath for anything explosive from Comey."
2017-06-03 12:36:48,Who is markethistory.org? Do they have details on their modeling data?
2017-06-03 11:56:00,"The US ""pumping more oil"" and gas, especially from shale plays, is exactly why Midstream MLP's will continue to be profitable. 

I don't believe retail is ""dying"" and believe there has been a complete market overreaction. 

Are there poor Commercial REITs? Absolutely there are poor companies in every sector. No time in the foreseeable future are grocery stores and strip malls going extinct.

Amazon isn't going to kill Walmart. 

Contrarian investing isn't for everyone. But I have made a good deal of money from it and having quality advisors. "
2017-06-03 11:39:20,Take a look at BOTZ and ROBO for  automation / AI and QQQ for tech in general.
2017-06-03 10:57:32,"I recommend reading Random Walk Down Wall Street first then taking a look at the sidebar in /r/investing. Learning takes time, by the time your done reading the book I'm sure you'll have a lot better understanding. I also like to make a little study guide for myself on important subjects (investing, accounting, econ) and using that study guide to make notecards I can quiz myself on. Another thing to keep in mind, is that repetition is the father of learning. The more time you ready/study the more you'll learn. "
2017-06-03 10:47:39,Seems like they are trying to time the market. The US stock markets are hitting all time highs day after day; the implication here is that stocks are more expensive and that the markets will eventually fall to more normal levels. 
2017-06-03 10:26:55,"In your opinion, are the defense sector stocks overpriced right now? I really want to get some, but I feel so weird about buying after the price has risen so much. "
2017-06-03 10:25:12,I've definately been looking at nvidia and amd. Is now a good time to get one? I feel weird about buying a stock that has risen so much in the past year. 
2017-06-03 10:17:43,"Fed is said to be getting wishy washy about further rate hikes following the likely one this month. Depending on how they fair during this one, i think that makes for a nice play on some high dividend REITs from here on out. At least until talks of further hikes resumes. I'll take 10% per year."
2017-06-03 10:13:22,Nice I like that a lot
2017-06-03 10:08:00,"I did not get what you mean by ""a bad time to get in "" ? "
2017-06-03 10:06:20,"Probably a bad time to get in. Just my opinion, though."
2017-06-03 09:36:44,It has happened in the past 2 years at all U.S.A. based airlines. 
2017-06-03 08:29:38,"You need to learn how to read charts and gain a firm understanding of how news, economic indicators and general market conditions impact the behavior of the stock you are interested in trading.

If you wish to predict stock movements in order to make money with short-term trading, focus on Price Action + Volume because those two factors are fundamental for making profits. 

The easiest trading strategy you can start learning to help you understand is called a Bottom Bounce. It is the purest form of ""buy low, sell high"" swing trading.

2017-06-02 18:57:58,This happens at all airways.
2017-06-02 17:04:26,"Referring to the Saudies? Yes their cost of production is very low but that's never been the point. They don't just Humpty Dumpty off to the oil fields and produce oil. They have a massive strategic  team to control the long term market. Their nations future depends solely on oil. And although $2X may be profitable, the state needs $70 to balance their budget. They have been pulling from their sovereign wealth fund since 2015 to balance their budget. Unlike the US they can't run negative state budgets forever. So technically, they need $70 to be profitable.

The point is the US can choose someone's supply and fuck them over big time. We don't spend half our GDP on a military to sit them in the corner and jack off. The only real question is who's supply is Trumps administration going to fuck over? And when?"
2017-06-02 16:45:20,"Midstream MLP's aren't dependent on oil prices. Their income is derived from transportation and storage. You will see record profits due to domestic transportation and storage volumes. 

I don't know what oil prices are going to do and I am not investing by betting they will go up or down. 

In my opinion, the best way to take advantage is to buy AMZA and CBA. "

2017-06-02 15:49:45,"Questrade costs almost as much as a full-featured large broker like Scottrade or TD Ameritrade which would have a Brick-and-Mortar presence for most regions. 

There's no reason why Robinhood isn't good for someone who is just starting. 

I understand that you hear bad things about Robinhood... This is expected as it's fee-less. Companies don't want it to succeed. 

However, I've had no issues with Robinhood at all since the invite. "

2017-06-02 14:02:53,"For robust examples of applied technical analysis, you should check out Carolyn Boroden (fibonacciqueen.com/) and Stephen Bigalow (stephenbigalow.com/).  Boroden trades using Fibonnaci sequences/ratios in both the price and time domains.  She finds convergences of different Fib levels - on both the price and time axes - to plan entry &amp; exit points with the highest success probabilities.  Bigalow runs the Candlestick Forum and speaks extensively on the use of candlestick patterns &amp; the Japanese theory/application of them.  Just to be clear, I'm not affiliated with either of these people, just a fan of both.

Personally, I put more faith in fundamentals.  Earnings and revenue (and the future estimates of both), along with valuations, have always been the best predictors of stock price movement in my experience.  And one of the better recent books I've read on fundamentals is Jim Cramer's ""Mad Money: Watch TV, Get Rich.""  I know he's divisive and a lot of people don't like or trust him.  Regardless, that book's written in an understandable style, which was perfect for a beginning investor like me, with many real-world examples of his concepts and their application.  Also not affiliated with him, just a fan.

Hope this helps."

Nowadays, installing alternative energies is proving to be cheaper in the long-term due to the increased supply of crude throughout the world which is destabilizing everything. 

With developing nations like India planning to **exclusively** have electric vehicles on the road by 2030, the only reasonable prediction to make is that crude will most likely keep lowering for the long-term, and it will no longer be the ""golden"" commodity in years to come. "

2017-06-02 10:28:15,"I would in any other sector agree with /u/Trooplee that you dont go in pennystocks. But you asked about weed which makes it a bit different.

Mainly because most cannabis stocks are penny stocks (less than $5) and/or close to it. Even the ones that are leading the market. Which is because in the states its still an illegal market (federally) and in Canada (which is now leading north america), its only legal medically (but about to be legal recreationally next year). and you said you are coming out of highschool and feeling like a risk taker. Weed is a smart choice to risk some money with as its literally an industry that did not exist that is about to explode. 

The big three in the weed companies industry right now are: **Canopy, Aphria &amp; Aurora.** 

All three of them are Canadian &amp; are already successful as medical weed growers(see financials as proof) and will lead the market in the recreational side next year. Not to mention that, they are planning to go beyond Canada and will tackle the North American &amp; European industry soon. They are available on NASDAQ.

I am personally long on all three. So do your research and decide whats best for you. I will say that Canopy is by far the most successful and the one that is ahead of all of its competition.

 
**BE WARNED:** these will be bag holding stocks that wont see much growth until next year. So if you do invest in any of them now, you will have to be patient until next year summer atleast before you get a nice return. Fortunately for you &amp; because of this ""bagholding time frame"" these stocks have never been this cheap to purchase since people cant handle the bag holding (understandably) and would like to invest their money in stocks they forsee gains in this year.

*I.e. Canopy sits at about $7CAD, it used to be $14CAD (and this is when it is just a medical company)*

[–]discontinuity 1 point 2 months ago 

Yahoo had one of the best free finance portals on the web. It is a cluster fuck now. The news is watered down. On top of that, shitty, shitty paid news is injected into the news feed and it's very difficult to tell it's sponsored. Scripts, tracking and other mal-ware have been introduced. It looks as if ""Web 2.0"" gained mind share at Yahoo, was half-way implemented then given up on. The site was 10x better two years ago. It's like she was paid under the table by Google to fuck it up. I used to love Yahoo finance, and it literally gives my anger management issues now when I try to use it. The design is so poor I get angry.

E-Mail. Switching costs for e-mail are high. Once someone is associated with an e-mail acct, chances are they don't want to switch. E-mail functionality is far worse than it was five years ago. Its horrendous. The tabbed e-mail Yahoo used to have was the bomb. Now the user interface is terrible. And what did we get for this slide in functionality? That's right, its far slower than it used to be. Full of who knows what scripts and shit. Takes forever to load. The best workaround? Install Chrome. That's right, they made the e-mail so bad that it forces people who (like me) just want to use out-of-the-box windows software to go out and get their biggest competitor's browser. And this doesn't even delve into the data breaches!

Their willingness to shove as much shit down their users throats, regardless of the degradation of user experience is profound.

For this fund, if you are convinced it will only be a dividend stream, why not do a dividend discount valuation to see if the current share price is a fair value.  That will help you value the fund without worrying about previous losses."
2017-08-22 15:33:10,"You learned that you should do research before buying a fund. [Here's](http://www.cornerstonetotalreturnfund.com/Data/Sites/4/docs/CRF_Annual_2016_final.pdf) their last annual report.

The fund currently has an annual distribution rate set at 21% of NAV ([it's set to stay at 21% in '18 also](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cornerstone-funds-announce-continuing-monthly-213053939.html?.tsrc=rss)). If the assets they hold don't have enough earnings to cover the 21% distribution they will sell assets to make up the difference. As they sell assets the fund will decrease in price.

The expense ratio for the fund was 1.33% last year so it is fairly high.

Because the distribution rate is currently set so high it is unlikely that the fund will appreciate over time unless it gets lowered in the future."

2017-08-21 09:26:23,"I think GE is at a great place long term.  They have the cash and cash flows to cover their dividend and debt,  they have invested heavily into future initiatives with industrial automation,  renewable energy,  etc., they are currently hated by just about everyone and downside risk is relatively limited compared to upside potential,  and the new CEO is about to complete his full assessment and announce results and consolidation strategies which could be a good short term catalyst. 

Edit for spelling"
2017-08-21 09:07:41,"I believe you're asking about Limit Sell. Which is an order that specifies a minimum price you're willing to sell your shares for.

2017-08-21 07:44:12,"Re:  ""Better than holding bonds"" - should definitely be qualified by stating that outside of the risk of bankruptcy (a condition shared even more acutely by equity investors) holding bonds *to maturity* is a far safer approach than investing in an equity security.  

Want to own GE?  They issue plenty of debt.  Owning GE stock has been a losing idea since at least the year 2000."

2017-11-11 16:45:44,"Yea np! There is no such thing as a stupid question haha!

Sometimes markets are irrational so companies trade at a lower value than what they have on their books. However, if the company flooded the market and sold off their assets such as oil or gold, will that book value change? I don't know. You might have to do some more digging. This may be Warren Buffett's Mentor Ben Graham's typical purchase."

#[CLICK HERE TO VIEW!](https://www.stockaholics.net/threads/r-stockmarket-2017-weekly-stock-picking-challenge-winners.3944/)

In 2018 I plan to run a members leaderboard point system for these weekly competitions as well as keep a record of all members stock picks.

I didn't really get a chance to do that consistently in 2017 as it was a little overwhelming at the time. But, I think I should be good to go in 2018. :)"
2017-11-11 12:40:53,Maybe once I am done with the txt series! :)
2017-11-11 12:38:39,"Would it be a good idea to buy a couple of days before the earnings release for some of these? I'm new to like being an active trader, and I'm wondering if there's short term benefits to maybe getting one and dumping it a bit after?"
2017-11-11 12:36:13,"Folks, before submitting your 2 picks in here please read the competitions rules in OP image that I have posted at the top here! The reason that I am saying this is because I continue to notice a few of you making picks that were either BELOW $2, or picking an OTC pick. This week I am really going to have to enforce this. If you post a pick that is below $2 from this Friday's closing price, or it's an OTC then I will NOT add you to the this week's competition. Sorry, but I really do want to make these competitions fair for everyone!

This also includes no leveraged ETFs from entering these competitions. So, please don't waste your time by posting up a leveraged ETF because it won't count and I won't add you to the contest spreadsheet for this week.

It's really not too much to ask since I am not requiring anyone to post up rationale for picks any longer.

The rules for this weekly competition are very simple. In order to be listed up as a contestant for this week you are simply posting 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple Inc.), and whether you want it Long or Short. But, again please remember that your picks prices MUST be at minimum $2!!!, and you cannot duplicate someone's exact 2 picks, only 1. If incorrect picks should go unnoticed you risk your position being forfeited. 

If you guys have any questions about anything just fire away in here. Everything honestly is in that first post image at the very top. :)

Here is an example of what you guys would be posting to this thread in order to be added to this week's competition.

EXAMPLE POST:

*****

**AAPL** - Long

**TSLA** - Short

*****

^ That's it! Pretty easy right? Unless of course you guys would also like to add a rationale for your picks as well which would be pretty cool and very much encouraged I might add! But, again it is not a requirement for the competition.

Anyway, without getting into further ado here, have at it with those stock picks r/StockMarket!

I'll have the live spreadsheet posted up in here a little later this weekend with everyone's posted picks from this thread. I hope we can get some really good participation in here once again for this week!

Have fun all and let's see who can pick the 2 best stocks for this upcoming week.

GLTA!"

2017-11-11 12:00:37,"Both speedtrader pro and Centerpoint use DAS, which is far superior to ToS. There's no price ladder, but DAS is institutional level software designed for speed and reliability. Fees are cheaper and short list is the best available, faaaaaar superior to ToS or IB.

The downside of course, is that these are for serious traders. Speedtrader Pro and Centerpoint have $30k/$50k minimums respectively. But, you get what you pay for. ToS is utter garbage compared to these platforms. If you're interested I can probably get you on Centerpoint with only $30k. Shoot me a message if you want details on that. Happy to help!"

Small tip, there’s a handful of grammatical errors. While not critical, it’s important to hammer these things out, esp when it comes to topics like investing.  Sometimes people will not take someone seriously about finances if grammar gets in the way.

I don’t understand why a company has market value of 2B, book value of 4B, I instantly double my money after I bought the stock... isn’t my asset simply the number of shares * price per share just like all companies ?  This might be a dumb question, but want to learn . Thank you "

A lot of financial statements are inaccurate and misleading. Honestly compare yahoo, Morningstar, zack, etc with any stocks. - pypl, JD, BZUN, etc. Therefore I️ have been analyzing all my main companies manually via excel and EDGAR and haven’t looked back. It’s time consuming but you learn more and feel more confident investing. At the end of the day I️ rather trust myself than a website that’s been inaccurate so many times. "

Anyone have a better take or reason I’m totally wrong?"

FYI, I am going back to JD AFTER earnings. I think they're gonna beat earnings, but what I expect to happen is the day after they announce earnings it'll dip for an hour or two and then shoot up if they're destined for glory.

2017-11-10 13:49:03,"It's extremely predictable daily. It's highest at open, dips mid day, and goes right back up at the end of the day. Every day. It just crossed it's EMA so as it goes up buy when it dips, sell when the trend starts a reversal. 

FYI, I am going back to JD *AFTER* earnings. I think they're gonna beat earnings, but what I expect to happen is the day after they announce earnings it'll dip for an hour or two and then shoot up if they're destined for glory. If they DON'T beat earnings then buy the dip when you feel it bottoms out. Easy."
2017-11-10 13:37:32,"If I were able to know for sure I'd quit my job!

I think they'll keep innovating (tesla semi, tesla car share, tesla bus) but if they keep messing up execution as they have with Model 3, it's going to take some years for them to get there.

Just to give you an example, the $350 price considered 500k Model 3 sold in 2018, or around $20B in revenues. It's pretty clear that's not going to happen until maybe 2019 so if we were completely rational it shouldn't get above that price in the next year, (ceteris paribus).

The Semi might spike interest, and any other announcements as well, but the longer it takes to execute, the more competition it has. That's going to make it harder to reach those sales. Additionally, the ""Elon can execute anything"" argument is clearly not as valid anymore and each announcement weighs less. 

Personally, I think tesla will hit $250 before it gets past $400. But then again that's my opinion and it could hit $350 next week after the semi announcement.

I'm only assuming the reason that it shot back up is because of them releasing those plans"

I don't think they were struggling at all considering looking back at their chart from 2008 to now; it's increased tremendously (I assume any splits/reverses have the adjusted price already set into the chart over the past 10 yrs). I wouldn't say it was to save themselves, rather it was just a smart investment opportunity for them.

  Also, Star wars was already a super successful series, as you know, with a huge fan base. They probably saw it as a great business expansion opportunity that cost then less than $5 billion to acquire. For example, Force Awakens had a $300 million budget and reaped just over $2 billion, excluding apparel and toys and games. They easily made their money back on it and are enjoying it's profits now

Long term I don't even think it's got that much of an advantage. Plug-in hybrids are the best choice for most people, the solarcity deal was a bailout, and there's plenty of other battery manufacturers with similar or completely other technologies that will probably end up with huge chunks of the market.

2018-01-30 18:57:41,"Nothing has changed in the economy or in company earnings.

The biggest issue was the rise in long-term interest rates - 10 year treasuries were cited.  There is really two issues with this:

- first, the yield curve rising and getting to a high level, signals that, some day, it will  rise to even higher levels and it could get so high that corporate borrowing becomes so expensive that earnings will fall and we could even go into recession.  Now that is still a long way off, but the recent yield curve rise reminds everyone that it is coming some day.  Everyone as in the collective intelligence and emotion of everyone investing.

- second, the stock market (equities) are competing against bonds for your investment.  10 year treasuries at 2.7% are competing with the S&amp;P500 P/E ratio of 23 or 1/23 = 4.3%.   Stocks with their higher risks don't look as attractive at 4.3% versus a safe 2.7% when a few months ago, it was 4.8% versus 2.3%.

Stocks were slightly over-valued in the last several weeks.  It was time for a slight pull-back.  But the 23 P/E ratio of stocks looks a little better if earnings rise in 2018 at the 20% projected by S&amp;P.  The P/E versus forward earnings is just 19.  1/19 = 5.2%.  So, if companies keep beating earnings projections and if earnings keep rising, then the market can go up a good 10% and still look good compared to treasuries.  

Earnings and the economy and interest rates.  It has always been this way if you study the history of the markets.   "

Even more amazing is the fact that the SPX is still w/o back-to-back trading days w/o a -1% daily drop in 112 trading days (this is currently tied for the longest streak since 1985). If today should again close down less than -1% in the SPX, it will make this streak the longest since going back to the mid-'60s!

And finally, perhaps for the most impressive stat of all is the fact that the SPX has not endured back-to-back -0.50% daily declines since just before the 2016 U.S. presidential election! That is 310 trading days and counting folks! Wow.

A majority of 5 year intervals are up after, when compared to being down. You can't argue with that because of price. "

He ran a fund that took a management share and a percentage of profits from (very lucky) investors. He averaged something like 22% returns for them, so he made his clients and himself a lot of money. He re-invested what would be his management fee, and he did this for an extremely long time, like 60+ years now. Even at 7% average return, 60 years takes you very far. "

2018-10-07 12:07:57,"&gt;why the stock prices of Chinese companies are dropping on all the recent tariffs

Even if the company doesn't import or export anything to/from the US, the tarriffs make all US goods more expensive for chinese people, meaning chinese people have less spending money, and slow down the whole economy. Furthermore, Chinese exports to the US are less profitable, meaning all exporting companies make less money, and their employees make less money which means they don't have as much to spend on chinese goods. And the economy slows.

Everything is so interconnected that there is nothing which is completely isolated from all actions of the US.

&gt;and its effect of a recession

If the US goes into recession, it affects the global economy. The US makes up more than 50% of the global economy. If they're not producing as much, then everything slows down globally.

&gt;why would a company want to list in another country

To raise more money. Chinese people don't buy as much stocks. Pretty sure half the people in the US own stocks. In china, it's less than 10% IIRC. Chinese invest more in property. So there's more demand in the US. It's also a lot easier for global citizens to access the NYSE/Nasdaq than the Shanghai Stock Exchange. I don't think my broker allows me to buy from the chinese exchange. So, they can raise more money."

2018-10-07 11:30:20,"Read Snowvall. It goes over all of it.

Buffett was a classic entrepreneur as a kid, and made his money through things like a paper route.

He starts up an LP and starts to invest in the capital markets using the knowledge he gained from Ben Graham. At this point in his career Buffett was buying “cigar butt” businesses. One of those was the Berkshire textile mill in the Northeast.

Buffett continued to buy businesses. In the book it goes over an immigrant woman who was a ruthless furniture store owner. Just random things like that. 

Some time goes on and Buffett changes his philosophy to “great businesses at a fair price.” Buying things like Coca Cola, and recently Apple.

2018-10-07 10:45:54,And?
2018-10-07 10:42:08,"I have long term put options on SNAP and CRON.

SNAP - poor management by CEO, long list of executive departures and the company lost 4x their revenue last year. Way overpriced compared to their much more established and profitable counterparts FB and TWTR

CRON - revenues of 7MM with a market cap of 2BB. Failure to disclose the size of contractual agreements for weed whereas all competitors have. Weed stocks way overvalued and the only hope for a dog like this would be for a huge investment stake by a legit company (think CGC). Except that would never happen for poorly run company like CRON

I believe SNAP will trade below $5 early next year and CRON will be around $2-4"
2018-10-07 10:23:56,And the 2/20 was a thing already in the late 1800's and probably hundreds of years before that. There were investment vehicles like that in the ancient Greece.

2018-10-07 10:12:22,"The economy is strong, the stock market is doing well, and there aren’t any hidden systemic/government issues (that we know about right now). So staying in the market is definitely the best place to be right now. Even if it dips/crashes, it will be back up again. The height of 2008 was surpassed in 2013. If you cashed out, you would’ve missed all those gainz."
2018-10-07 10:08:38,I see you’re a Hodler as well 
2018-10-07 10:04:28,"Come on you can question the math without begrudging him. Buffett comes from an upper middle class to upper class family. His dad was a congressman and a stock broker. His grandfather owned a grocery store. Definitely not the Kennedy’s, but at the same yeah it’s questionable whether his story is possible without that solid foundation. What if his family were share croppers?"
2018-10-07 10:01:00,"To be fair, the drops are much stronger and wipe out months of gains."
2018-10-07 09:40:45,"Buffet was never a HF manager, and the 2/20 fee structure wasn’t a thing until the ~1980’s"
2018-10-07 09:33:17,How are you gauging this?
2018-10-07 09:17:28,"During mild or modest bear markets they might be fairly stable or even outperform other sectors but they got hit basically just as hard as everyone else did back in 2008. Utilities usually offer less growth but more stability and higher dividends along with being involved in things the public requires regardless of market conditions (electricity, heat, internet, landlines, water, etc.) so sometimes people shift to them if they’re not confident in the market. I’ve noticed as of late they’ve been green on days like last week when everything else was hurting in red but I’m not sure a trend like that would continue if the market truly enters bear mode."
2018-10-07 09:13:05,"If you’re looking for value, there really isn’t a ton. However, I still remain optimistic with the future potential of TCEHY and BABA here. I think both of these Chinese holdings are worth buying here. Also, if there was anytime to get into FB, this is a good time. The cash flow and fundamentals are just too strong to pass on."
2018-10-07 09:00:09,"Warren Buffett is an incredible intelligent and successful man. He earned every cent he has and will go down as an all time great. He worked hard and made money in a variety of ways from selling newspapers to million dollar business deals over the years. He was also very frugal with his spending and aimed for moderate risk, relatively stable type investments in things that weren’t the flashiest but always needed rather than high risk/high reward flashy ones.

That said, he did have a few things working his in favor. His father was a congressman which helped open up some doors for him and put him in touch with some powerful people and mentors. His family wasn’t super wealthy but they were definitely upper class and far from poor. Buffett also worked in insurance and was very good at using insurance money and leverage to make up a good chunk of his money. This was a big one as he had enough money in his hands to make such moves. He was also very good (and lucky) with some of his acquisitions/buyouts/mergers and achieved them with some incredible timing.

So yeah, connections, access to capital, and wealth definitely helped. But don’t let that fool into thinking he was some lucky fool. A lot of people would have lost the money or not come anywhere close to maximizing the type of returns he achieved in his lifetime."
2018-10-07 08:49:16,"I’m surprised nobody has mentioned that his father was a prominent local businessman and US congressmen. Still, by all means I consider him a self-made man, but it definitely helps when you’ve got friends in high places. "

2018-10-07 07:56:14,"If people can see you're really good at what you do, they will throw tons of money your way for you to make more money. You get a cut of all that money you make. So if you were undisputably the number one investor somehow, then the world's capital (and the world's gainz) would be in your hands."
2018-10-07 07:44:16,It’s either on the decline or getting thinner out because no one likes using FaceBook. Lots of people are branching out to competitors.
2018-10-07 07:38:35,That depends entirely on your investing methodology. If you're a swing trader then you typically gold stocks for a few days or weeks at the most.

# October is the Best Month of Midterm Year

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens. 

&gt; But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results. 

&gt; Midterm election year Octobers are downright stellar thanks to the major turnarounds mentioned above; ranking number one on the Dow, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. This is also the beginning of the sweet spot of the four-year-presidential-election-cycle. The fourth quarter of the midterm years combines with the first and second quarters of the pre-election years for the best three consecutive quarter span for the market, averaging 20.4% for the Dow and 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 (since 1949), and an amazing 32.0% for NASDAQ (since 1971).

# Should We Fear October?

&gt; Here it comes, the scary month of October. Many investors have bad memories of this month, mainly because it has had some spectacular crashes. In particular, 1929, 1987, and 2008 are a few of the years that saw October scar investors for a long, long time.

&gt; Here’s some good news: Over the past 20 years, the S&amp;P 500 Index has shown a higher average return in October than in any other month. And the good news continues. This is a midterm year and, sure enough, midterm years have actually been quite strong for stocks. “Incredibly, since 1982, the scary month of October has seen stocks fall only once during a midterm year. Not to mention it has been the best month overall going clear back to 1950 for all midterm years,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, October has been up 3.3% on average during a midterm year, ranking it as the best-performing month–ahead of the usually bullish months of November and December.

He made his money by convincing other people to give him their money and let him invest it for them. In return he gets a cut. He started a number of investment businesses straight out of college and got rich quickly.

He is a very good investor as well as a good salesman, so people kept giving him their money and he kept getting his cut.

His books and YouTube videos that imply he made his wealth by investing are all part of the sales job. He has done a great job building up his public image, which, of course, was a big part of what helped him convince people to give him their money."

2019-01-10 21:33:08,"I see the similarities to a covered collar but what you're saying is not covered because you're short SPY, not long. You don't own anything that would covered the put. 

\&gt; If the market moves slightly bearish, I'll make money from the short, but the put and call will cancel each other out since I used the premium to buy the call.

You'll make money from the short, but lose money on both the call and the (short) put. They only cancel each other out if the market doesn't move. If you were long both the call and the put, then they'd roughly cancel out. Let's assume you're going to buy the put back to close the position. If the market drops, the call you bought is worth less and the put is worth more. But you don't own the put, you owe it to someone else, so that's bad for you that it's worth more.

\&gt; If the market moves extremely bullish, then I'll break even (and possibly make money) bc of my call option which covers my loses from my short.

What about the put? It will lose value if the market goes up. But in your case that's a good thing because you sold it while it was worth more. You can now buy it back to cover the position for less than you received in premium. 

I think you might be confusing this with a long straddle, which is buying both a put and a call. In this case, if SPY moves slightly in either direction, the put and call would cancel each other out. But if you sell one and buy the other, they will go up or down in value together. 

I could be wrong about this but you should probably double check that. "

2019-01-10 19:06:31,"If you're bearish, buying the call is a protective hedge but selling the put is another bet in the same direction. If the market goes down, the call loses value and you now have to come up with the funds to cover the put. Only the short will benefit you in this case, are you saying the short more than makes up for both of these losses? Or do you become bullish if the market drops by that much?

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds to me that both the call and the put are a hedge against being wrong, just a debit/credit neutral hedge."

As of today, the Total Market Index is at $ 26613.8 billion, which is about 128.8% of the last reported GDP. The US stock market is positioned for an average annualized return of -0.6%, estimated from the historical valuations of the stock market. This includes the returns from the dividends, currently yielding at 1.98%.

In summary the stock market is significantly overvalued. Based on historical ratio of total market cap over GDP"

Right now hedge funds and investors are investing for quick profit and hope. And that could change next week.

You can not predict the markets because that requires predicting peoples movement/reaction, and it can be irrational."

Part of it is there is a massive liquidity problem. Interest rates are too low and they have been too low for too long. This is driving a lot of cash in to equity, which drives huge bubbles in the stock market. We won't learn our lesson. We don't want to eat our broccoli. The official strategy has been to spend and cut interest rates during recessions, and to spend and cut interest rates in bull markets. We should be regulating and raising rates."

But if you believe that the market it not affected by economic forces (the correlation between interest rates is pretty clear of late) OR sentiment you're being obtuse.

They are indeed not directly connected but for the last 100 or so years, the stock market has been an economic indicator for the overall economy."

Modern monetary theory throws all of that out of the window. Printing money used to be a bad thing, bankruptcy used to be the consequence of bad planning. 

Not anymore. Bankruptcy is now a state of mind and a choice. Creating money out of thin air is also not dangerous, might even be a good thing.

So long America is confident in itself, and turn the free money back into government bond purchases, the money printer can keep going. the real challenge will come when the hamster decides to take a break. Shit'll hit the fan real fast."

2020-04-30 18:38:28,"You are not taking a couple of things into account 

1) Demand for stocks is strong because supply of money exceeds the opportunities available. There are few alternatives to equities with interest rates so low. 

2) There is no moral hazard anymore. Capitalism without bankruptcy is like being a catholic without hell.

2020-08-04 00:04:52,"Well, not exactly, I see you've been watching too much financial tv. Inflation is low because foreign countries are still dumb enough to take dollars for trade, investments etc. What one should watch for real inflation is the dollar and gold, which has risen exponentially over the past few months and people are starting to become aware of this. 

No offense, but the fact that you think the FED is dealing with the crisis well is testament to the fact that you arent as well versed with the economy as you think. I mean it's not too hard to understand, trillions in transfer payments to the unemployed will only motivate them to STAY unemployed, especially when they are already so scared of catching covid. Furthermore, all this printing and extra money put into the economy will only devalue our currency, this is called inflation tax, it's where the fed prints puts more money into the economy thus having more money itself but your money now has a lesser purchasing power, so it's a very covert way of taxing people. As soon as people start to realize the true gravity of the situation, which a lot of people are hence the rapid rise in gold and silver, the value of dollar is gonna fall greatly, and my best guess is that we will move BACK to a gold backed currency which has already worked for us before. 

The fed needs to cut its balance sheet, the government needs to downsize to get rid of its debt and the tax rate shouldn't be decreased like trump wants, that's only gonna increase debt. We should also INCREASE the interest rate so banks have more deposited money for loans which they can give to small businesses to expand to increase unemployment. 

At this point, the bursting of the bubble just needs to happen, and only then will there be a chance to create a better economy. This next crisis is gonna be a sovereign debt one, as it's not easy to pay back 26 trillion worth of debt to people!"

IAU, gold, and SLV, silver, ETFs have done great lately. They could drop or trade sideways with a new stimulus package announcement but will be steady rising otherwise until a new vaccine is administered and proves successful after several months. 

APPL has a stock split later this month, which could bring in new investors and increase your share value.

MSFT might buy TikToc which could put them at the forefront of social media data acquisition and advertising if they don't fuck it up or if China doesn’t nuke the US first.

DG is where all the poor people shop and will do fine throughout the possible prolonged recession.

HD is just a beast. I honestly think HomeDepot is more stable than all the major tech companies. Who is going to fuck with HD? 

ETH seems like a thrill ride with a lot of upside.

2020-08-03 21:47:54,"I think it depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like, how much $2500 is to you, and when you'll have additional money to put in to the market.

Personally, I'd stay away from AAPL right now. It's way over priced. The best recent time to have bought in to AAPL was the dip in late March.

If $2500 is all you have for a while and you're just getting started, buying single stocks is not the best idea. Before even touching stock, make sure you're maxing out your 401k. If you're not currently hitting the $19500 limit this year, figure out how much you have to adjust your withholdings on your remaining paychecks to reach it. Then readjust after the first of next year so you'll hit the 2021 limit by December 2021.

If you're not getting a 401k at your current employer, look in to maxing out a Roth IRA first. Basically, you want to make sure to capture all the tax free investments first.

After you're maxing out your 401k, consider slowly buying SPY. Maybe 1 share per week or per month, depending on what interval you'll have more investment monies.

None of this is as sexy or flashy as, ""Hey, I own some Apple."" But you'll probably be better off in the long run.

Edit: This also assumes you've gotten rid of all your bad debt (I.E everything you owe that's not a mortgage.) and you have 6 months (give or take) of emergency funds.

If you haven't gotten rid of your bad debt, pay that down instead. If you don't have an emergency fund, work on that instead. You'll be able to make better financial decisions when when circumstance doesn't have you by the balls."

I could take profit now, buy it back later at a lower price, I sold it popped- I FOMO'd and bought it back higher only to see it go from $68 to $72 then down to $55.

2020-11-06 14:41:10,"OK, here are more examples, again, his own words:
In February 2016, during his campaign for president, Trump told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ""So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell … I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise."" The video shows, Trump is not smiling or chuckling as if this was intended as a joke.

On several other occasions, Trump invoked violence without necessarily inciting it. (Hat tips to the Washington Post's Aaron Blake and Mashable for collecting a number of these in one place.)

• November 2015. At a rally in Alabama, Trump said about a protester, ""Get him the hell out of here, will you, please? Get him out of here. Throw him out!"" The following day, calling into Fox News, Trump responded to a question about allegations that the protester had been ""roughed up."" The protester, Trump said, had been ""so obnoxious and so loud … maybe he should have been roughed up. Maybe he should have been roughed up. Because it was totally disgusting what he was doing.""

• March 2016. At an event in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump referred to a past incident with protesters. “We have had a couple that were really violent, and the particular one when I said I’d like to bang him, that was a very — he was a guy who was swinging, very loud and then started swinging at the audience and the audience swung back, and I thought it was very, very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back, and that’s what we need a little bit more of.”

• March 2016. At a rally in Kansas City, talking about someone who had rushed the stage, Trump said, “I don’t know if I would have done well, but I would have been out there fighting, folks. I don’t know if I’d have done well, but I would’ve been — boom, boom, boom. I’ll beat the crap out of you.”

Trump's words have, on occasion, drawn lawsuits. However, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union has written skeptically about whether Trump's words would qualify legally as incitement to violence.

Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney with the free-speech group wrote concerning a lawsuit stemming from a Trump rally in Louisville, “incitement charges have been used to jail anti-war protesters, labor picketers, Communists, and civil rights activists. Over time, the Supreme Court learned from these mistakes and adopted a very speech-protective test to determine when incitement has taken place … It’s a high bar for a reason, and Trump’s conduct at the rally didn’t meet it.”

Our ruling

We found one example — when Trump said, “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?” — that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or encouraging violence. We found several other examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence.

Trump's words may not meet a legal threshold for incitement to violence, but Huckabee Sanders' portrayal seriously distorts the record of Trump's past statements. We rate her statement False.

“The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.”

— Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday, June 29th, 2017 in a White House press briefing

2020-11-06 14:34:45,Well if your doing income investing your probably getting stocks primarily with a 5%-10% yield. It depends on your lifestyle and expenses but even at that rate $1m would only get you $50k-$100k annually dispersed across monthly checks or quarterly
2020-11-06 14:33:07,I really wouldn't worry about that.   The media has made a living trying to paint him in a bad light but he's not going to do anything crazy like that (and if the markets thought he would it would be reflected).

2020-11-06 14:28:37,"Because with stimulus &amp; inflation cash is devalued causing an increase in prices to everything from housing and consumer goods to stocks &amp; gold.  

You'll still have the same amount of cash but it will be worth less.  I doubt we will hyper inflate so I wouldn't say cash is trash but it rhymes and I've always agreed with the sentiment.  Cash doesn't go to work for you if it's not invested."
2020-11-06 14:25:46,"When I swing trade, im fairly conservative in my approach and limits. Some trades are for $800 profit, other for $30, but the big number at the end of the profit sheet that says ""total"" is the nice number that comes together with both big and little wins. I might be counting on big profits, knocking me up a thousand dollars or close to it, but I take a lot more little gains that add up overtime. It's the adding up over time part that makes up for the loss of benefits in long positions (like dividends).  


Likewise, with the best accounts able to swing trade with, that of an IRA or something, you can only add so much into them a month, so you have to grow them from within somehow, to gain on their main benefit of being tax exempt in profit. Where the more you can put into a trade, the more you can make/lose on a trade, so you would naturally want more in the account to trade with so that you can make more. The only way to do that is through profitable trades, and many over time, to build up that account. 

The realistic goal should be to make one 150% profit trade in one's life, a couple trades over 70%, a few over 50%, even more over 30%, but lots and lots of 5-20% gains over time. This slow accumulation is the only way to make easier the fast and large gains, but also grow the account in the most basic. As far as risk in concerned, as long as you never lose, you grow, and the best way to never lose and grow IS to actually have many small profits along the way; small profits hedge the lose of big shots, and accumulate the most and fastest over time towards the ""luck"" of having a windfall."

2020-11-06 13:56:49,"Yes, but Jack Ma's relationships with the central government and the financial and business community that invested a great deal into this IPO is permanently changed.

First of all, his public attack on regulators was planned in advance and well thought out:

&gt; Late last month, as Ant’s mega I.P.O. was coming together, Mr. Ma made an appearance at a financial conference, the Bund Summit in Shanghai. He spoke after bigwigs including Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, and Yi Gang, the central bank governor.

&gt; “Our next speaker needs little introduction,” the host said. “He says he came to the Bund Summit today to throw a bomb.”...

&gt; He then proceeded to throw several bombs. He roasted financial regulators for being obsessed with minimizing risk, even though, he said, “there is no innovation in this world without risk.” He accused China’s banks of behaving like “pawnshops” by lending only to those who could put up collateral.

People in China don't doubt that he intended to attack the regulation of fintech. Or that he acted like an ass:

&gt; One wag on social media called Mr. Ma’s remarks in Shanghai “the most expensive speech in history.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/technology/china-ant-group-ipo.html

But I think the thing to recognize here, that makes all the difference in my assessment, is that China's fintech empires were making money hand over fist in an an area of finance in China that was being largely ignored, and there wasn't a lot of control over how much money was being lent in loans that were backed with nothing and being resold as securities. When the value of those businesses start amounting to trillions, as the ANT IPO demonstrated, that's a big systemic risk to society. So not a lot of people are arguing that regulation was uncalled-for or unnecessary.

Jack Ma blew up the IPO because he was trying to lead an insurrection against regulation that would limit the value of ANT, but that was needed, and the way he chose to defy authority speaks to his own inability to compromise or work within a system of financially responsible constraints.  I also wonder what the businesses are doing if he has so much problem with oversight and regulation. 

This disaster says more about Jack Ma's lack of judgment and defiant egotism than the CCP. I don't trust his personal judgment anymore and while I think that BABA is a great business and has a great future, I don't think that it has as much potential as I thought last week. To me, I need to see how much the company is worth after the halo of ""exceptionalism in leadership"" factor fades and Americans realize what an intemperate jerk he is, before I'll allocate more than a few percent to BABA and its related businesses again. 

Jack Ma threw a temper tantrum to try to leverage his fame and epic IPO to escape regulation instead of working responsibly with the government on regulation that is overdue for China's fintech businesses. He fucked over everyone who had invested money and time into this IPO and I lost money along with a lot of other people. I don't forgive him."

There are going to periods like last week where almost no matter where you look everything is going down for no real reason. And you could lose big.

I'd say shoot for a monthly average income for X dollars where X is your desired income for the year ÷ 12 with about a 10% buffer so you can offset any bad moves.

To that goal; the safest strategy would be a strong dividend portfolio that has enough stocks to get payouts monthly.

The riskiest is to sell covered options but thats not for the faint of heart and requires more active management on your part than buying and holding dividend stocks"

Then came along venmo and other shit like that.. let's call those alt-pay apps. People slowly but surely were accepting it, using it etc.

No not the best 3 example but hopefully you see my point. That's why I  stand by any good Crypto news is good news for all Crypto.. alts or not. The more the good vibes go out to media etc the more people get used to hearing it and then accepting it and eventually using it.

It is also curious that Tether was revealed to be only 74% backed in 2019, but now it is 100% backed. How did it get from 74% to 100%? From risking the reserve on corporate bonds and crypto and getting lucky they both rallied? And why was it only 74% in 2019?

I think you are doing great. Learning and investing. I recommend investing in ways to increase earning potential. This does not always mean investing money.

Invest your time to develop skills, go out and meet people in your industry, develop relationships.. hell you may even decide to start your own business which can allow for passive income in the future with a lot of sweatequity. 

Also go and experience more things in life! Have some money put aside for travel, experiences, fun stuff and things that you will cherish."

2019-07-20 13:36:07,"I started as a complete beginner about 7 months ago with $500. Kept adding more money as I became more comfortable with the stock market. I am not an expert on how to become an expert, but I can tell you what I did when I started:

1. Used Robinhood (no transaction fee/commission) because I was making small trades and the fees would be too high otherwise, comparatively. Also, most of the other brokers would give you so much information (Fundamentals AND Technicals) that it would sometimes become overwhelming. Look at the interface for Robinhood and Webull (both zero fee). Robinhood's interface is intentionally simpler, targeted to complete beginners. There are some order filling issues (slight delay, hidden very small fees) but that would only become a problem IMO if you were trading and not investing (use limit orders!).
2. Read ""**One up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch**"". This was an absolute gem (Get the 2nd edition). It takes you from a ""complete beginner"" to ""comfortable in investing"" and, most importantly, is fun to read! Can't recommend this book enough.
3. Follow subreddits (current AND past posts) related to investing and trading. This is important because you will see fundamental,  technical and options terms thrown around, that you would have no idea about, making you curious, and goading you to learn those.
4. I haven't reached this stage yet, but I have realized I need to study further (probably read some books) on several topics like accounting, using options as a hedge, etc.

By step 3, you might have realized that the best strategy for you would be to diversify across several ETFs, or, you might decide to allocate 60% of your portfolio to ETFs and 40% to individual stock picks, or, if you are even more risk-averse, maybe a 5% allocation to options trading (for that risky gambling fix!).

My thought process is that I mirror closely what happens in the crypto sphere and react in time to such changes. Why I warn about that in regards to metals is not because that’s different there, it’s because the mindset of people that buy gold or silver is different. 

These people are not used to newcomers replacing their metals applications, for thousands of years there wasn’t something that **could** replace it, or drastically change its supply for that matter.

But we live in crazy times these days and I fell like it will only get crazier. People like metals because they suggest safety, I feel like the only safety these days is being nimble and reacting faster than your peers to the changing world we live in."
2019-07-20 12:54:27,"I just think certain shows went on for too long and some shows shouldn’t have gotten such a big budget. What draws me to them is their deal with CW that’s ending soon. A lot of good shows that are essentially Warner Bros go to Netflix. 

They need a lot of quantity in the beginning and probs were going to sift through all the shows and go let’s cut _______  number of shows because they aren’t doing well. The only problem is after they sifted through everything they realized a lot of shows left are average or slightly above average with nothing massively successful. A few gems but nothing that’s a treasure chest. 

An example of a gem is Seven Deadly Sins, an anime a lot of people loved and enjoyed so they kept their subscription or bought one. It did well and was very popular. My issue is the rest of the animation all is the same style and looks the same but I don’t see anything of incredible value.  And some decent or real good ones but most aren’t great at all and are below average or won’t bring enough viewers or subs.  I feel like this is Netflix’s problem in a nut shell they focus on making too many originals and thus bring the quality down as a whole. Where they could use that money to get quality shows from another studio."

Since 2017, I started actively posting every single buy and sell within my portfolio and writing to a list of subscribers that I had acquired from both Seeking Alpha and Stock Twits. This project has gone extremely well. Just this past month we decided to pull the trigger on Alphabet (GOOGL) into weakness, and finally added a small position in a Canopy Growth (CGC). I will be looking for further opportunities in the market as the year goes on. Obviously, as valuations become more and more stretched, opportunities are harder to come by. However, every month I will continue to analyze my portfolio and writing on it monthly to ensure that I have the strongest roster of stocks moving forward.

2019-07-20 12:39:18,"First of all, congrats on the $2k from Youtube. I have a Youtube channel myself! 

Anyways when I first began actively investing myself I was also 17. I lost 80% of the first $2k that I put in the market because I was undisciplined. Many people will tell you what you SHOULD READ, but first you need to spark your own interest and understand what you're doing.

Set aside AT LEAST 10% of your income to start investing with. Invest in a household name, something you easily understand. For me, I started off investing in PepsiCo (PEP), Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX), and Visa (V). These companies were all obvious picks in a growing economy. Finally, once you've invested, then start reading reports, reading books, studying the markets movements...you have skin in the game so you will care more and take this serious.

I hope this makes sense. For all of you beginning investors this is a great method. Additionally, if you need income to invest with, I suggest house hacking. Buy a duplex and rent out half to lower your expenses to give you lots of income to play with.

2019-07-20 12:28:18,That’s what they said about Facebook and Apple not seeing $200 or Amazon not seeing $2k..... my bet is at $450
2019-07-20 12:26:46,"Credit cards never made it there in the first place outside of expat use and the push is just beginning in earnest. 

The CC companies will be investors in any large project. They bought in to Libra before that fell apart.  Visa partnered with Line Pay this year in a few Asian countries allowing Line Pay users to buy from Visa merchants without having a credit card."

2019-07-20 12:25:28,"Blindly buying these is not a sure thing. Good companies for sure. Overextended valuations especially considering interchange pressures and the decline of credit card/rise of debit. Rising interest rates may exacerbate this trend. 

Do I think they will go out of business? No. But they may underperform the market in some near term."

2019-07-20 12:23:48,"With the goal of leaning in mind, I would suggest pumping the brakes a bit. If you believe in this stock then put your 1000 into the stock and paper trade the stock on the side....this way you get the reps (for free), hopefully make money from the stock, and you can get some time in watching how the stock trades so that when you go to make real trades you hopefully have a bit of an advantage"
2019-07-20 12:21:31,"Maybe sign up with ThinkOrSwim and use their simulator first for experience. You can set it to any point in time and trade it. $1K is not a lot and will result in you going into penny stocks and using leveraged trades, maybe save up a bit more before going live and work out a complete strategy. Obviously nothing in a practice account will compare to real money but in this case at the minimum you have an idea how to handle each trade you make."
2019-07-20 12:20:51,I think an overlooked intangible is what they’ve done to their brand by shitting out half assed exclusives for years. I never got the strategy of doing quantity over quality to such an insane degree but their fans always make it seem like borrowing billions to fund shows that will certainly be cancelled in two years is some flash of genius.
2019-07-20 12:20:07,"I own V and it has done me well.   As a business owner, credit cards are bullshit.  Processing fees are my largest expense after rent and employee s.  I will be glad when this model is replaced."

what i aim for isnt profit, but experience  


also i believe (based on hype tho not on statistics) that wow classic will bring profits which will increase the stock price of atvi, so i believe that even if i fail my daytrades, i'll make some money with this swing trade (if thats how its called). So my plan is to do as many trades as possible and a swing trade of the same stock when wow classic gets released"

There's a reason Disney is planning on charging less. It's going to be a fairly limited service that won't have anywhere near as much content as netflix. Disney+ will be comprised of old movies, a couple of first run movies (but not all of them because they don't want to piss off Walmart by ruining bluray sales), and less than a dozen original series/movies per year. 

For most people, the primary streaming service will be netflix for the foreseeable future. Disney+ will be a second or third tier choice  behind Netflix and Amazon. At least for the next 5-10 years."

2019-04-15 19:07:05,"&gt; The problem wasn’t the idea of cable. It was the prices going up from ~$30/month to over 100 in the span of a few years.

Lack of competition allowed cable companies to do so.  Now there's *too much* competition among streaming services, and nobody offers a complete package with a decent price.  People are naive if they don't think prices will rise over the next 5+ years.  Seemingly every single channel has their own subscription service now that was bundled before.  Let's take AMC, included with most cable packages, and maybe not something I'd want to subscribe to specifically, but I enjoy flipping through channels and they have some good stuff that I want to watch.  There *IS* value in having everything conveniently in one package.

I'm not quite convinced that shuffling between 1-3 services at $20 a pop (again, you're naive to think prices won't reach this level) to watch the good shows is ""better"" or ""easier"" than just getting cable again for $50.  I can't even watch the Blackhawks (hockey) legally here because all games are blacked out on NHL Live if they're on Comcast Sports Net or whatever hosts 85% of the games.  

It's also annoying that streaming my local news channel because I get horrible OTA reception can't show sports clips (against league rules).  Stuff like this isn't trivial.

But anyway it was just my opinion, nobody knows anything.  I just think there's subtle nuances that people will slowly get fed up with and something new will come out."

Start your investing with John Bogle's recommendations.

Then, if you're interested in investing in individual stocks, I'd read The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. If you enjoy that and want to get academic about it, you can then read Security Analysis by Benjamin Braham. 

Start the boglehead way, 100% in index funds. Then after reading more, you can decide if you want to try picking stocks or not. Some people are great at it, others less so."

I'd venture to say it isn't. Disney has a 100 year start in the whole content and established brand equity department... all they need to do is turn a switch (which they are with Disney+) and people will drive in drows to get live action Marvel, Disney, and LucasFilms content. Let alone the vault they own of their animated classics...

Netflix pioneered the model but they certainly will not be the ones who last. Their BEST bet is priming themselves up for an acquisition from Google or Microsoft."

2019-04-15 13:24:04,"You touch on some very valid points. Netflix's data is spot on. They cancel far less shows than other studios. Also Netflix is making its own content which is pretty phenomenal.   


Only time will tell but I am long Netflix and have been adding at dips. So far it has worked out fairly well. I have more than doubled my original investment and taken out the principal so at this point I am playing with the houses money."

2019-04-15 13:20:39,"I think Netflix is like one of the bigger studios now

With horizontal expansion, the question is how many of those studios can compete with these conglomerates 

Judging by grocery stores selling more name brand than store brand, plenty would survive. But I don’t think that’s comparable because the data edge Netflix will have will have them making edgy niche things that people want to see cheaper than the studios who are just throwing darts"
2019-04-15 13:10:07,"Well that's sort of what Hulu offers. You can get and manage all of your subscriptions in one place and it feels remarkably like one seemless subscription. Disney+ might get relegated to a Hulu add-on as opposed to standalone service, but its still Disney that gets the benefit. They own too much now, and those big studios they own will start putting things on Hulu, not Netflix. 

I don't think Disney+ is the direct contender, but I do think it might be the straw that breaks the Netflix back."

2019-04-15 12:52:36,"This is what I was thinking! I was sort of thinking it would take the approach of cable companies,  where you can buy Wi-Fi separately but you can get service cheaper if you bundle it with phone service. Basically, yes they're separate, but we're going to make the deal too sweet to not bundle both. And you'd get so much content between every platform in a centralized place that you really wouldn't need Netflix for a separate $12.99 a month. If there was really original content that I cared heavily about, I'd subscribe for a month a year and binge it, then turn it back off.

I just can't see a mega Platform like Hulu is shaping up to be not ending up on top"
2019-04-15 12:49:43,"Basically, im not sure why it did that"
2019-04-15 12:47:06,"More importantly why is the stock market rallying for a service which Disney itself will lose money until 2024, on top of all the missed revenue they could've gotten licensing out their content to Netflix and others. Honestly I think the rally is 1) this is a new sexy service and you're right this really isn't a Netflix competitor, Netflix themselves they compete for screentime against Fortnite and Reed Hastings says he'll subscribe for Disney+ himself, and 2) Disney just completed a $70 billion acquisition of major Fox assets, and that is now being seen in the real rise of Disney stock."

2019-04-15 12:37:53,"Ultimately I think that NETFLIX, HULU and Amazon Prime will be the last players standing in the next 10 years for streaming. The producers and studios will end up capitulating and moving back to a model where they get paid large sums of money for the right to stream their shows on Netflix's platform.  


They have big user bases who enjoy their OG content as well as the interface and have accepted the price point. I bet that most of the people out there do not want 10+ subscription services.  


Cable is toast no matter what. THat model is dead it just doesnt know it yet. As soon as sports networks figure out that they can have exclusive streaming etc. cable goes the way of the dodo bird."

People cant value holdings of companies in Asia/Africa, we have a large sell off which spreads to western markets and then we all calm down a little by late 2020."
2019-04-15 12:34:03,"My understanding is that Disney is positioning their services separately, with Hulu having more mature content than Disney+. Disney is likely to offer a ""bundle"" with some combination of Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, but we don't know what pricing for that bundle would look like. I think a bundle will be stiff competition for Netflix though, since it's a two-front war with kids-friendly entertainment and more mature content."

2019-04-15 12:16:08,"No, 5 years ago was when Uber and Lyft were limping along with minimal viable solutions.  ‘Simple’ changes like moving to up front pricing were investments of 100s of millions in labor and compute costs.  Just pricing is an area that they can iterate on for years, shaving tens of millions on each iteration. There are no open source solutions to optimization at this scale or applied to nuanced problems like guiding a two-sided marketplace in real time. Anyone who works in the industry knows that grabbing an open source package is only the beginning. The money is made by the countless, novel tweaks and costly experiments—the lessons learned here are not accessible to low-scale operators like RideAustin.

Speaking of which, RideAustin is not a success story. Since Uber and Lyft were re-introduced, it’s share has fallen to an estimated 10-20% of the market and continues to fall.  Others ceased operation altogether.  The fact that RideAustin hangs around with an inferior service in a minor city is more a testament to a niche desire for supporting local business than an indicator of its ability to stage a legitimate fight.  In fact, Lyft and Uber continue to grab more rides as the market grows in Austin. RideAustin on the other hands is stagnant, which is to say: all new growth goes to the established companies."

2019-04-15 11:14:45,Huawei has reached an unprecedented time in its life where now the whole world (average people) are waking up to its corruption and espionage-like practices. Apple wants to cut costs like any company but risking making a deal this big with a company as universally disliked as Huawei is very risky. We will see what Apple ultimately decided but my bet is they'll either make their own chip or outsource somewhere else.

Lost opportunity cost

To determine the cost of your lost opportunity: subtract the value of the choice you made from the most valuable choice. The remaining value is the lost opportunity cost. 

Or in this case, if OP sold at a loss and invested in better company he could return the lost money and maybe even gain a  little bit, also could use loss for tax purpose 

​Opportunity Cost=FO−CO

FO=Return on best forgone option  
CO=Return on chosen option​

2022-02-25 17:23:00,Why do you think markets were all down 10-20% in the weeks leading up to the invasion?  Just imagine the nasdaq was humming along obliviously until 2/23 and then dropped 20% in a day; that’s basically what happened just in a smarter timeframe

No apocalypse is good for markets. Two, sanctions on Russia were weak af, and therefore so will retaliatory Russian sanctions. So speaking from the heartless viewpoint of markets, we have certainty over the conflict not expanding (for now), and the financial impacts will be minor."

2022-02-25 16:33:00,It’s not actually based off oil prices at all. I bought it before the stock split a couple years ago and offloaded after it rocketed a bit. If you read into or I can find the article. It said something along the lines of millennials are buying this with having no idea of what it actually is. It’s based off of some sort of monthly and quarterly contracts. What the contracts are based on who knows I’m sure you could if you do some dd but I’m still learning as I’m 23 and didn’t care about doing the dd on it. But was thinking the same of buying it with the hopes of oil/gases prices rising but talked myself out of it.

It's not too surprising that there is some inefficiency there because the only good way of building a SCV value portfolio is through ETFs. Holding individual SCV value stocks is risky, and they're not as liquid as large caps. Plus large funds are less likely to be interested as those stocks could only form a very small % of their portfolio."

You're not really losing that. Wear you are seeing is the difference between the marks in your short and long strikes. Your real loss is limited to your initial debit (just now the warning above about closing on expiration date)."

2022-05-31 19:58:00,"Leveraged ETFs only work when the underlying is more or less continuously moving in the right direction (up for normal, down for inverse). Even then, you make less than the headline leverage, due to volatility decay.

Sideways price action, you lose money. Price action in the opposite direction, you lose more than the leverage multiple indicates.

So for SQQQ, price action over most of the last year has been opposite, but has been in the right direction for several months, but not enough to make up for the volatility decay during the previous period.

For TQQQ, the price action has been opposite for several months, so it's losing more than 3x QQQ.

Just about any time QQQ is near or at net zero over a period of days, both SQQQ and TQQQ will be net negative."

2022-05-31 18:07:31,"Since none of the top comments are constructive at all. The reason you are down on paper is due to illiquidity in those contracts and wide bid ask spreads.  Illiquid options contracts have poor pricing. Your $117.5 ITM call would never be worth less then the $120 call if you were to sell both contracts right now. But because they’re super illiquid, they probably have IV’s that don’t make sense and therefore poorly priced. Look at open interest and see if there are other owners and make sure your contracts have tighter bid/ask spreads in the future."

2013-02-28 19:51:43,"Here's the full memo:

-----
People of Groupon, 

After four and a half intense and wonderful years as CEO of Groupon, 
I’ve decided that I’d like to spend more time with my family. Just 
kidding – I was fired today. If you’re wondering why… you haven’t been 
paying attention. From controversial metrics in our S1 to our material 
weakness to two quarters of missing our own expectations and a stock 
price that’s hovering around one quarter of our listing price, the 
events of the last year and a half speak for themselves. As CEO, I am 
accountable. 

You are doing amazing things at Groupon, and you deserve the outside 
world to give you a second chance. I’m getting in the way of that. A 
fresh CEO earns you that chance. The board is aligned behind the 
strategy we’ve shared over the last few months, and I’ve never seen 
you working together more effectively as a global company – it’s time 
to give Groupon a relief valve from the public noise. 

For those who are concerned about me, please don’t be – I love 
Groupon, and I’m terribly proud of what we’ve created. I’m OK with 
having failed at this part of the journey. If Groupon was Battletoads, 
it would be like I made it all the way to the Terra Tubes without 
dying on my first ever play through. I am so lucky to have had the 
opportunity to take the company this far with all of you. I’ll now 
take some time to decompress (FYI I’m looking for a good fat camp to 
lose my Groupon 40, if anyone has a suggestion), and then maybe I’ll 
figure out how to channel this experience into something productive. 

If there’s one piece of wisdom that this simple pilgrim would like to 
impart upon you: have the courage to start with the customer. My 
biggest regrets are the moments that I let a lack of data override my 
intuition on what’s best for our customers. This leadership change 
gives you some breathing room to break bad habits and deliver 
sustainable customer happiness – don’t waste the opportunity! 

I will miss you terribly. 

Love, 

Andrew "

I love blackrock if that helps. "
2013-02-25 09:33:07,"Let me see if I follow this.  I don't have a great understanding of bonds at the moment.

Currently the Fed is flooding the market with lot's of very low-yield, ""safe"" bonds.  Eventually bond rates are going to tick up and all the old bonds are going to be very unattractive to buyers as the yield is so low. (As even going from 0.25% to 1.25% is 5x the yield)  This makes all the old bonds drop in value on the market making people who bought into them lose the liquidity in their money and/or have to sell at a low price.

Since the bond market is so low at the moment, people are dumping money into stocks instead inflating the stock market.  When the interest rates tick up, people will begin to shift back to bonds and the stock market will lose some value.  

Also when the interest rate comes back, the mortgage interest rates will necessarily come up with it.  (Again, with rates this low even a small increase in mortgage rates can quickly lead to a large increase in payment amount.)  This will cause housing prices to drop.  

The federal government is also running up debt like mad at very low interest rates.  Once the interest rates come back up, the government will be forced to pay much higher returns on all the debt as it renews it leading to a larger budget deficit.  

So all told, they would either have to keep the charade going forever or they're going to crash the whole market?  Is that right?"
2013-02-25 09:28:30,Well those institutions and 401ks aren't likely to be liquidating their bond positions. They usually hold them to maturity. 
2013-02-25 09:07:44,"If US debt is repudiated or downgraded (one or both MUST happen), the dollar will shrink in value. Equities will be all over the place; some creditor's equities will die a horrible death, others will get huge bailouts, mining and agricultural equities will be up. Money will chase good deals, as always, and irrationally underpriced bonds will be snapped up, probably at the expense of stocks in general. I suspect most portfolios will take a beating."
2013-02-25 09:00:22,"Institutions represent individuals, and I'm guessing most of those individuals are holding 401(k)s loaded down with ""safe"" bonds. I am guessing old Warren Buffett isn't holding a lot of government paper."

They could pull a Japan or not, but there are a growing number of reserve bank chairmen that are speaking out against the money printing. Whether its through crashing the bond market in nominal terms, or devaluing the dollar itself, the bill will come due."
2013-02-25 07:07:41,"Why do you assume there will be an exit?  Japan has kept the charade going for 25 years, why not another 25?  Why would the fed ever exit - with so much political pressure to keep it going, where will the pressure to end it come from?"

he wants to know what YOU screen for when looking for shorting opportunities. Not vaguely, such as ""blah blah MACD RSI blah blah"" but stuff like ""yield of x% with a market cap between $aa and $bb and a book value / share ratio above x.y""

It's not clear by your responses whether you've actually used a stock screen er before. A stock screener is a filter where you give it a set of criteria such as above, and it returns a list of companies that fit that criteria. 

As a simple example, you could type in market cap &gt; 318.85B, and it would return only 3 companies: apple, exxon mobile, and protective life corp. 

That's a simple example, and obviously not a good screen for discovering good short opportunities, but again, it wasn't clear you've ever USED a screener before. "

I guess that implies you are not an advocate of paper trading for beginners.

Absolutely. I think paper trading is the worst thing you can do. If you are a beginner, trade with an amount of money that is small enough so that you can afford to lose it, but large enough so that you will feel the pain if you do. Otherwise, you're fooling yourself. I have news for you: If you go from paper trading to real trading, you're going to make totally different decisions because you're not used to being subjected to the emotional pressure. Nothing is the same. It's like shadowboxing and then getting in the ring with a professional boxer. What do you think is going to happen?

[https://trader-dante.com/](https://trader-dante.com/)  It's about the same price and I believe that it's way more in depth than what this guy has to offer. In opinion the course you mentioned looks like your typical FOREX scam just based of the site lay out. I'd recommend checking out the Chat with Traders podcast episode he is on before buying Dante's course.
2019-10-23 11:45:47,Thank you!
2019-10-23 11:42:16,RLMD has been going up since reverse split a few weeks ago. Generally it seems from others I have asked that reverse split = warning to sell soon. But it has gone up in weeks since.

2019-10-23 11:26:50,Go make a paper trading account on tradingview and trade until you're profitable. By the time you are profitable you'll be able to open an account in your own name.
2019-10-23 11:26:02,"My advice: 

1. Don't treat this like you'll have to spend several years studying, reading and preparing before you invest anything -- more likely than not you'll turn it into such a big obstacle that you'll never get around to doing anything.

2. Start small but as soon as you have some money to spare. This will be depending on your budget, but try to set aside some money every month, even if it's $50 or less.

3. Pick an area you like or are interested in and buy some stocks, as stated even if you're just spending a few bucks, or saving them to be able to buy a somewhat more expensive share. E.g. if you like computer games, maybe invest in Take-Two, Nvidia or Activision/Blizzard and so on. This isn't so you'll be any kind of expert on the stock, but just to give you an incentive to keep updating yourself and stay with your investment, rather than run out of steam and forget about it.

4. Don't assume you can predict swings in the market. Just treat your stocks like a long-term (5+ years) savings plan, avoid making sudden/large alterations without a very good reason.

5. Don't assume anyone else can predict swings in the market, or that their opinion on what you should do is worth more than a random 50% chance. Historically, even ""expert analysts"" fail to predict swings and often recommend exactly the opposite of what in hindsight would have been correct. I.e. take any kind of analyst advice with plenty of salt."

2019-10-23 10:58:39,"I was in a similar position and opted to go with Schwab through a custodial account. I don't do a lot of technical stuff on the platform though, so TD Ameritrade might better suit you."

However, especially in niche markets like Marijuana. There is definitely more money to be had by common investors/traders, by simply blogging about it, or ""vlogging,"" than actually investing people's piss wages towards Marijuana. 

If it is one thing I have learned about small time investors, is that they are constantly seeking validation over their investing decisions. They will stare at a wall of advertisements just to read a piece by anyone who reassures them they aren't just gambling their money.

I'm kinda lost with all my experience..So far from what I can see it all started to dip around 7/29 and only went down from there. All cloud-related stocks were at their all time highs around that time too. So they have been affected by general market instability more than regular tech stocks like semi-conductors which took a hit almost a year ago.


I'll read news about all tech companies that do cloud-related business like amzn see if I can figure out why they're earnings were bad on 7/25. Amzn's AWS actually carried their last earnings apparently.. wonder if any other company can show some insight."

2019-10-23 01:21:57,The old baby boomers own most of the wealth in the nation in the form of real estate. Millennials have trouble purchasing property burdened by debt and stagnant wages but as millennials are getting older they are able to purchase property so wealth is slowly being transferred to them. If not now but definitely in next few decades millennials will start to take over as economy’s drivers.

2019-10-22 17:23:52,AMD is the better option in the server market compared to intel due to AMD's new zen architecture.
2019-10-22 16:59:01,"This question may be better suited for r/semiconductors   But hopefully I can help you. 


AMD is at 7nm technology. Intel is not there yet, they’re at scale at 10nm. Intel has a large network effect because of their PC/laptop chips, a lot of companies have written code to specifically work on Intel chips, meaning switching to other vendors would cost more. 


Here is where Intel has a disadvantage: they manufacture their own chips while fabless (companies that don’t make their own) companies outsource that to ‘foundries’ like TSM, Samsung, and others in that order. The capital cost for making your own chips is a lot, the cost for making cutting edge chips (7nm, 5nm, etc) is astronomical. TSM and Samsung are investing heavily in themselves to win this sort of arms race, while Intel has to balance its effort between designing, building, improving, and selling these. 


I personally don’t like AMD right now simply because of their 185 PE. If they came down in price or posted earnings on 10/29 that brought the multiple down, I’d be quite interested. AMD has arguably the best semis available aside from NVDA, but my opinion here is quite lacking and I’ll leave that to the AMD and NVDA fans. Intel needs to get 7nm at scale soon to avoid losing market share especially as 5g dawns and demand for increasingly small semis increases. 


Intel reports Thursday, AMD on the 29th. Compare the two after that."

The positives are the numbers look great with insane growth.

the negatives are what is the CCP going to do. I personally feel they want all these US listed companies to delist and go to their exchange where their own people can prosper. Some of the numbers just don't look real either and I am not talking about BABA. Also when they talk auditors it's always a affiliate of Deloitte or one of the big 4 auditing firms which are sketchy. Those numbers can be faked  and there is absolute no repercussions. Look at Luckin coffee or what they did to the investors at SINA  going from 120 to 40's. DIDI as well and the list is so long not to mention all the Chinese scams with the reverse listings.

Also why did BIDU get 1+ billion in loans the other day at 3-4%. They have over 10 billion in cash. Sometimes I look at these Chines companies and they look at the American investor as their piggy bank. If these stocks are so great and numbers are so solid why aren't they buying their shares back at a insane rate (Baba bought back 200 million worth this Q) . All of these companies should be buying back billions in stock right now.

BABA is a great company, however it is easy to manipulate with FUD. In the end I hope it turns out, however between numbers, government control, and auditing there is better places to park money."

2013-04-13 12:18:31,"Buy low, sell high"
2013-04-13 08:11:41,"Every option has a delta.  If a market maker sells a put, let's just make up that it has a delta of -40.  He would hedge his position by buying 40 shares of the stock (or another option trade that has +40 delta).

By doing this, his position is unaffected by the price going up or down.  Over time, as the delta changes, he will rebalance so that his delta (aka risk) goes back to 0.

2013-04-13 02:48:59,"If a market maker filled your order to buy a put then they would be short a put, and to hedge they would need to be short the underlying. The opposite of what your saying. "
2013-04-13 00:54:00,how does this work exactly?
2013-04-13 00:38:12,"Maybe someone who's well informed on how the hedgers operate can chime in.

But I once heard that when a market-maker gets a order for a put, they sell a call and/or buy the underlying stock (or something similar) to cover their ""short"" put. 

What this could mean is that when investors get scared and buy puts to hedge, they could actually be pushing the stock price higher. 

This time around, with such a low VIX it is very cheap to hedge. So it may be a while before people get actually complacent, and it freefalls.

I get what she means that are sometimes talented people who may ""choke"" under pressure.

Is it true that when market is super-down, somebody makes a lot of money?

Example: I bought shares of ABC company at $80, but the shares are now worth $15. Now think where does the extra $65 go?

Lets see four different entities: A company and three people named X, Y, and Z. A wants to sell the shares and X,Y and Z has initial positions as 
·         A has $0 (but owns 1 share)
·         X has $200
·         Y has $500
·         Z has $1000 

1.    A has initial public offering called IPO, and sells 1 share of stock to X for $30.
2.    A stock value goes up, and X sells his share to Y for $80.
3.    A stock value crashes, and Y sells her share to Z for $15

Hi there,
Beginners make some common silly mistakes at the early phase of investment.The first one is they look for the stock alone and do not calculate the financial situations.They just go for the same sector stocks with same buying value that had given them decent profit in previous investment.For instance,X buy $85 share in Agricultural sector and get $50 profit after 6 months,Then X start to look for the same $85 value share to buy for his next investment.Another similar example of this is Y made decent money from silver industry last year then he only look for the same industry this year to make same or more amount of profit,which in fact can be a blunder investment mistake because the overall capitalization or P/E value or volume of share might have changed this time.So every time you make an investment in share market you need to do a detail research before investment.

In 2013, to understand the stock market direction and movement, the most powerful indicator is the research on market conditions. 

The first strategy is to have more and more cash on your saving account rather than credit cards or loans. The reason for this strategy is that in 2013 the broad based market decline might occur and experts are predicting that in 2013 lots of low value opportunities will be available for trade off. Which will definitely be a good cash investment in 2013?

Some strategy tips are 

1) Strategy 1 is to lower your credit card loans and personal debts. To lower the debt you must make a strategy to clear the debt in specific period of time. You can do it by dividing the debt by months and see how much you can put regular amount of money to pay that debt in full. This will generate some saving in future as well reduce your financial stress in long run.

2013-09-06 08:53:37,"Others may do things differently, but I have two rules: 1) Only invest in things I understand, and can make an accurate prediction on what it will take to make the stock move, whether towards the black or the red. 2) Make a plan and stick to it, and keep emotions out of it. 

I have a story I like to tell because it was a great, albeit expensive, lesson.   Six years ago I started trading biotechs; I did months of research to learn a bit about the nature of the sector and what the process looked like to bring a drug to market. After my research, I made the plan that I would purchase stocks that had cleared their Stage III clinical trials and had a PDUFA date on the calendar(the date when a drug could be approved for sale by the FDA).  Depending on the hype around the drug, the plan was to hold it until about 2 weeks before PDUFA, and historically I could expect a 10-15% return as the stock ran up in anticipation of approval. Got it. So after doing this successfully a few times, I felt pretty good about myself and bought a stock with a cost basis of about $7500, a lot of money to me at the time and a large percentage of my trading capital. I watched it run up to just above $10,000 over just two weeks, and I was ecstatic. At this point, my plan dictated that I should sell and walk away........except I didn't. You see there had been a bunch of approvals lately, and stocks were increasing tenfold over night.  I sat there, with my tiny lizard brain, and I thought, ""Well, $10,000 is good!  But you know what would be better?  $100,000. I'm sure it will get approved!"" (I had no idea, I'm not a chemist, I don't work for the FDA, I still don't ever know if anything will be approved).  So... I held it. And the company received a 'complete response,' which if you're not aware is basically a letter from the FDA telling the company everything they need to fix before they reapply. Relative to the stock price, however, it's a rejection- I went from $10,000 to $4,100 in a matter of seconds... I could only watch it bottom out as it sped past my stops, because obviously in retrospect, if it's plummeting, who's going to buy it from you?  I had no idea something could move that fast.

There's happier stories, and I did eventually make that money back, along with quite a bit more through some very exciting transactions, but those didn't teach me the same lesson that losing 60% over the equivalent of going downstairs for a cup of coffee did. 


TL;DR: Invest in what you know; if you want to invest in it and don't know it, get to know it. Have an entry and exit strategy, and when you make a plan, stick with it. Keep emotions out of it. "

In theory, you can make more money if you trade more often. For example, consider a stock that moves from $20 to $30, then back to $25, then up to $35, then down to $30, and finally up to $40. If you buy at $20 and sell at $40 you double your money. Nice! But if you buy at $20, sell at $30, buy back at $25, sell again at $35, buy back at $30 and sell again at $40, then you will make much more than ""just"" double.

So that's the essence of the game. But it's easier said, than done. Unfortunately, nobody has a crystal ball. So learning *when* to buy and *when* to sell is the real key thing to learn. It's a zero sum game of hot potato basically. Everybody buys in. Some people walk away richer, and some poorer. And while there is certainly randomness to it, it's not pure chaos.

If you can learn how to read the charts properly, you can make much better educated guesses at when to buy and sell. Sure, key events may throw technical analysis out the window and the stock will skyrocket or tank based on the event. But 99% of days, nothing groundbreaking is happening. So if you can learn to read the charts, you'll be able to make a better educated guess as to whether the stock is over-bought, over-sold, or at an equilibrium.

A great site for charts, and learning how to read them, is:

[http://stockcharts.com/](http://stockcharts.com/)

If you start trading actively, I highly recommend signing up for their premium services. Good charts and scanning services are well worth the money!

So, that's the basics. Your strategy should really resolve around how much time you want to spend on the market. To be a successful active short-term trader takes a lot of time. You need to be constantly scanning/evaluating charts, reading about market trends, etc. If you don't spend that time, then you'll make bad choices about when to buy and sell.

If, like most people, you'd rather take a longer term approach (Months/Years instead of Hours/Days) then my advice is to pick stocks in sectors that you have some knowledge of. For example, if you work in IT, focus mostly on tech stocks. That way, even if you don't follow the charts and market news constantly, your industry knowledge will allow you to understand which companies are poised to do well and how the trends may affect those companies.

Good luck!"

2013-09-05 23:21:04,"True, there's the opportunity cost of holding onto a turkey. I've had stocks that took over a year to go back up, and often wonder if I should have been willing to take a small loss by selling, in return for a bigger gain by buying. But I'm not that great at picking yet. Usually I pick a stock thinking it's down and going back up, but then it keeps going down.

And recently I sold a lot of holdings because I had made a tidy profit, only to see them continue to increase. I'd say ""don't look back"" but I think you always have to look back to learn. Just, look back, but don't let the regret eat at you. Kind of like on Wheel of Fortune at the end, when the winner misses the last puzzle for the $30,000+ bonus. Pat Sajak says ""but that's not real money, it's just theoretical!"""
2013-09-05 22:57:17,"That is all actually pretty much what I follow also. Except I will sell when I am down if the word is not good on it. Especially right now, stocks that go down are not guaranteed to go back up, but more often than not, they will.

Also, ETFs."
2013-09-05 22:43:14,"I'm not very familiar with technical analysis, but I have played around with the google finance charts, and the period seems to be automatically determined by the date range of the chart.

For example, I opened up a one-year chart for some example stock, added a 200-period SMA line, and got SMA(200,1d).  Then I pushed the start date of the chart back 1 month (maintaining the end date, thus making the chart longer) and got SMA(200,1w).

I think that sucks."
2013-09-05 22:31:29,"Don't put too much in there. Treat it like gambling, only play with money you can afford to lose. If a stock you liked goes down, look at the fundamentals again, and if they're not too bad, buy more of it preferably the same dollar value that you originally bought, so it will be more shares. I read about that method when my 500 shares of NOK went down to $1.77 or so, so then I bought 800 shares. Those shares were already up quite a bit when MicroSoft bought Nokia's device unit.

But that method doesn't always work, don't do it if a company has a lot of bad vibes online. I bought IMGG on the advice of my brother-in-law's nephew. It plummeted, and then I rechecked the word online, and people were excoriating the CEO, so I didn't buy more and I'm only down $1000 on that one.

I never sell when a stock goes down, and with the exception of IMGG, I've never been disappointed, they always go back up unless you pick one that goes bankrupt.

In a wishy washy market the way it has been for some time, I like to just pick a few stocks, get familiar with them, and then buy low and sell high. Stocks have been fluctuating a lot, and if you keep up with what makes them fluctuate, you can make more money than just holding.

Even stocks that are worth holding are also worth buying and selling. I recently made money with CSCO, because I bought it at $19 on the advice of Motley Fool or something like that. I was all about holding it when it went up to $26, but then they laid off a bunch of people and it tanked, so I sold at $24 for a nice profit. But then as long as I buy it back for less than I sold it for, I can keep on the train as it recovers and continues to rise.

I'm sure people will tell me I'm doing it all wrong. Everybody's got an opinion."

2013-09-03 00:37:15,"An extended correlation can be used for an arbitrage opportunity if it's valid. You wait for a divergence, and then bet on a convergence. In this chart, for example, if you bought $10k apple and sold short $10k gold after the divergence, then when they converged you could close both positions for a profit. Your profit is the divergence when you initiate the position minus the smaller divergence when you close the position. 

But it's not that easy, because even if a chart ""looks"" the same, it depends on the scale and the percentage moves. If gold drops 20 points and Apple drops $5, sure, it seems like you make money ($15 worth of convergence captured)  But what if you had 100 gold and 400 apple (because your goal is to have equal $ per position)? Then you've only broken even. Obviously it wouldn't be difficult to lose money if the positions diverge further or if your share counts are sub-optimal. "

People have done this thousands of times. They look at the stock market (S&amp;P500) and find predictive stocks based on this logic. For example, they find a stock for which t-1 is correlated with t for the S&amp;P500. Then they say they discovered a way to predict the stock market.

Also no foreign transaction fees.

Completely useless for the average person, AMEX gives off an ""elite status"", and most of the perks they offer aren't very special. Chase's sapphire preferred offers almost all the perks (minus airport VIP lounges, which are pretty pointless if you're not a frequent flyer), and rewards are far more rewarding, as in it's actually nice to use as a business card on expenses you have to already make and get a free vacation out of it.

Realistically, what you probably should do is google ""thinkorswim paper money"" and download that trading platform - it will give you $100,000 of fake money that you can play with, just to get a feel for how the markets work, and how commissions can eat away at returns quickly.

To pick a good stock, you really need to understand how companies work. I'm not talking simple, ""US airways buys planes, hires pilots, and sells tickets...revenue!"" You need to understand the details of the company, what are their major cost buckets? Are they in line with the industry? What are the challenges that they face? What are the challenges that industry faces? What do the financials look like? Sure net profit is growing, but why?"" Is that growth sustainable? Are they growing revenue? Is that the result of a one time large order or is it organic? Lastly, is there a catalyst to unleash the value of that company? Is there something in the near future that is going to make the market realize that they had severely under valued this equity? 

This is just how I look at a company (along with forecasting future revenues, profit, EBITDA, etc.). Day traders certainly look more at charts, and other market indicators like short interest, etc.

But seriously, go read the Intelligent Investor.

2013-10-21 15:14:35,"First, look at the mix of market sectors in the fund. This will tell you about the volatility of the fund. For a quick list of sectors, take a quick look at [this on FinViz.com](http://finviz.com/groups.ashx). In general, anything heavily weighted toward big financials will do well in this market. (Smaller financials are less reliable.) Anything weighted towards Tech will be volatile, which means that price changes in those stocks will be amplified over whatever the market is doing. Anything weighted towards Utilities or Consumer Goods will be less volatile than the market in general. The Healthcare is very good right now, but that could change in an instant. Basic Materials &amp; Industrial Goods are highly dependent upon the health of the economy.

Since you are a beginner, avoid the leveraged funds. You amplify both your winnings and your losses with leveraged funds. These are not for the faint of heart or for beginners. 

You need to be clear in your own mind what your reason is for investing that money. To be specific, you need to know how much you are willing to lose before cashing out, how long you want to keep your money in that ETF before cashing out, and - most importantly - you need to have a clearly defined reason for buying that particular ETF. Once you've defined those things for yourself, you should check ""reality"" against your investment thesis at least once a month."
2013-10-21 14:42:25,"..and I would add that investing your hard-earned money because (a) someone on the internet said it was good and/or (b) someone on TV/Radio/Big Media said it was good is - in a word - stupid.

The market is riddled with the broken bodies of ignorant retail investors who believed an ""expert"" and lost everything.

-------------------------

Let's say you have $5000 to spend, you're considering two stocks with the exact same level of volatility (market cap, $ amount in trading volume) and everything, the only difference is the stock price.

-----------------------------

Stock priced at $90:

$100 call is selling for a $5 premium. Each contract costs $500.

You buy 10 contracts for $5000 (1000 shares)

Call is exercisable at a profit for anywhere above $105 (100+5)

Stock shoots up to $120 (+33.3%)

You make (120-105) x 1000 = $15,000

---------------------------

Stock priced at $900

$1000 call is selling for a $50 premium. Each contract costs $5000.

You buy 1 contract for $5000 (100 shares)

Call is exercisable at a profit for anywhere above $1050 (1000+50)

Stock shoots up to $1200 (+33.3%)

You make (1200-1050) * 100 = $15,000

A prime example of this would be Brk.A and Brk.B, except there's differences due to voting rights, and people make a tiny bit of money off arbitrage regarding that anyway..."

Another similar ETF is PBW which is a lot cheaper. Similar to TAN but is more diversified into all Clean Energy. Includes biofuels, wind, tesla.

I would say wait for a pull back in the next couple months to get in but its only gaining more momentum and I am not sure waiting for a pullback that may or may not be cheaper than the near future is worth it. Either way my 2c.

DISCLAIMER: I am long on TAN and PBW. 

I will also mention CSIQ which is CANADIAN Solar. It has been doing great. I believe both ETFs I mentioned include it but, being Canadian and all and having plenty of time to ride the ups and downs might be more lucrative in the long term. Harry Boxer from Marketwatch just pumped it this week.

If you're looking for a long-term hold I don't think you're in the right sector. I posted a few days ago about NPS Pharmaceuticals, on absolutely nothing but a hunch. It had a negative P/E ratio, something along the lines of -$.40 EPS, absolutely nothing in terms of numbers to go on but a hunch. Next day, up +8.5%.  

So go for it if you aren't looking to hold for too long. A strategy on that might be to look for one that loses 4% or so one day, buy, and hope it rebounds from that. It's kind of like Groupon in the sense that it seems like every other day it is either up or down 5%. So be careful, but go for it. Happy Hunting!"

If you can make money on the short term, you don't really need to throw your money into long term investments. But really, open up a brokerage account and drop your money into ETFs or Index Funds. You can open up an account with Charles Schwab for $1000 or a small monthly deposit. Start building a bank roll and figure out what you're doing before you start throwing money at stocks. Learn about due diligence.

2013-12-07 12:44:12,"&gt; However as soon as a few companies or services refuse to accept Bitcoin 

Um... yeah.  When credit cards came out, I'm sure the companies were really scared that some stores or hotels wouldn't accept them. God forbid, no. 

This is obviously opposite of the truth. When credit cards were invented, nobody accepted them initially, except the few organizations who signed up pre-launch to help jumpstart the process. And a proto-creditcard issued by gas-station X was only to be used at gas-station X and not at gas-station Y.  If some store said ""We dont want to accept credit cards"", that bothered nobody anywhere. 

To re-iterate, 99.99% of the worlds industries right now are ""refusing to accept bitcoin"", and not any one of them specifically is causing a fear that bitcoin isn't trustworthy. You know what causes fears that its not trustworthy? When people lose all their bitcoin with no recourse, or when major bitcoin wallet sites get hacked and all the coins stolen. "

It's not the first time you've done it.

[Value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_\(economics\)) and [utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) are not the same thing.  Food has more utility but it is less valuable because it exists in much greater supply.   Being something we absolutely need only makes it more valuable when the demand for it exceeds the supply.  At that point, nobody would give a shit about gold and food would likely become more valuable, but we are not at that point. 

You really need to learn to deal with being wrong and to understand that because your emotions tell you to feel a certain way doesn't mean you're actually right, but I do think it's hilarious that the guy who doesn't even know what deficit is thinks the qualified accountant should take some economics courses.

The dollar, for example, is backed by the US government. Thus, when you buy dollars, you're buying an *n* amount of the US GDP. It's a promise from the government for an *n* amount of value, and the dollar's value only falls if the people don't trust the government to fulfill it's promise. 

Bitcoin isn't backed by anything. It isn't a representation of anything. The only value it has is the promise of *""it'll be worth more tomorrow"".* It has only marginal utility (it's a shitty medium of exchange) and the value it has comes solely from the expectation of selling it to someone else for more. It's an ""it has value only because it has more value tomorrow"" sort of thing. If you want to play the game, go ahead, but know that what you're doing is playing Hot Potato. "

Currently my investment (even at today's drop due mostly to news from China) is above 200%, and I'm a relatively late adopter.  Unless a huge fear-selloff or hack/crack of cryptography used, this is a naturally deflating currency due to the ultimate limit of bitcoins available (unlike fiat which naturally inflates, this is a good thing, similar to gold or other limited commodities).  Whether or not bitcoin itself succeeds is unknown, but crypto-currency is probably here to stay.

2013-12-06 18:51:21,"Started doing EW in 1983 then worked as an analyst at EW Int'l in Gainesville, Ga for 7 years.  It *seemed* to work pretty well in the early 80's (incl Fibos) then it went to hell - esp after the '87 crash.  Did it become too popular that the Elliotticians started fading fifth waves, etc? Or did the advent of more money in fewer hands skew the idea of ""group psychology?""  Don't know - probably both. 
In reality, it is a technical system based on bull markets (esp. in stocks) ending when momentum rolls over and bear markets ending in panic. So a good set of technical indicators, trendlines and channels are better than trying to retro fit an EW count to chart patterns, b/c that is really what you are doing the majority of the time.  Even then, subsequent market action turns that relabelling into mush most of the time anyway.
Try using channels and trendlines on charts of differing time frames to 1) determine the trend and 2) determine if that trend is complete and trade in the direction of the trend.
One tool that works well in determining the potential of a trend change is to apply a 14-period RSI to the 14-period RSI of a price chart.  Often, a new price high (or low) that coincides with a divergence between the two RSI's will signal a trend change - of SOME degree. BUT...you want the divergences to occur relatively close to one another and not divided by too much time. 
Of course, if that divergence occurs with price pushing into or beyond a valid (i.e., tested by price and repelled more than a couple of times) trendline/channel AND the RSI is significantly overbought or oversold condition (weekly/monthly being more significant than an hourly chart) then the greater the potential for a successful trade. 
Also, appreciate the simpler Japanese candlestick patterns.  Dojis and cloud covers can tell you a lot about the market psychology. But be careful not to read too much into it when a market is looking forward to a significant fundamental event, like today's employment figures. Obviously, the market is going to be nervous at that time. 
Finally, never short a dull market. 
Good luck dude. Unless you wanna go quant and look for mispricing in options, etc, KISS is the best way to trade markets from a technical perspective and tricks like putting indicators on your indicators will give you better insight into the health of a market trend than 99% of the other technicians who can only recite ""RSI is too overbought to buy here.""  Bull markets get overbought and stay overbought; ur job is to determine when that overbought condition is eroding."

Regardless Bitcoin is too young and extremely volatile. Even though it has nearly gone up 7x since what it was originally worth at the start of November, I still believe that it is risky. As more and more companies accept Bitcoin as a 'legitimate' currency the value of bitcoin will keep going up. However as soon as a few companies or services refuse to accept Bitcoin (this^ ) it creates a fear that perhaps the bitcoin isn't such a trustworthy currency after all. Which in turn drives more fear and lack of trust in the Bitcoin. In the long run maybe bitcoin will be a useful and beneficial tool for global economics. Or maybe it won't.

2014-01-22 06:16:28,"It's a bit of a complicated question, and it depends very much on the details. Could you do it? Technically yes, but practically no.

If it's a listed stock (it trades on, say, the Nasdaq), the market center filling your order owes you the best available price. So if the bid/ask for the stock is $.99/$1.01, and you submit a limit order to purchase at $1000/share, the market center would see the order and work it as a marketable limit order. You are telling everyone you are willing to pay $1000. Because you are willing to pay more than the current asking price ($1.01), your order would be handled as a market order (you pay the ask price) up until the order is filled. With one share, that doesn't matter; you'll simply be filled at the best available price.

So the order would be picked off and filled, likely at the $1.01 asking price. Market centers are required to do this for listed securities. The exception would be in the extended hours markets, where orders are not held to time and sales. If you were trading the stock after hours, there may or may not be anyone acting as a market maker. If the stock is very illiquid (lets say the daily volume is only 25,000 shares in the regular session, it's likely there wouldn't be much activity in the after hours market; there very likely may not be anyone else trading that stock in the after hours). You could submit an order to buy one share at $1000, and if there were no other orders out there, your order would become the bid. If you did become the bid, someone else could sell you 1 share at $1000. This is unlikely to ever happen with a $1 stock.

The fact that it is 1 share also has a big impact on the likelihood of success. If it's 1 share, its considered an odd lot order, and it would not show up on the tape. The order would be filled, but only orders of 100 shares or more (100 shares is considered 1 lot, and that's what is required to have a price reported to the tape). So for 1 share, yes you'd buy a share for $1000, but it wouldn't be reported to the tape. And I'm guessing that you'd want that price reported, otherwise how could you go from thousandaire to millionaire on paper?

If the stock is not listed on an exchange (it trades OTC/BB, like a pink sheet stock), things are slightly different. OTC/BB orders aren't held to time and sales, though during the day there are likely several market makers involved in the security. If the market is $.99/$1.01 (there are a stream of buyers ready to buy at $.99, and sellers ready at $1.01), you are going to have a tough time buying 1 share for $1000. There are plenty of people who will sell you a share for $1.01, so your order would likely be filled at $1.01.

Again though, if there is no market (no one is willing to sell the stock, at any price), you could theoretically put in a bid to buy 1 share at $1000. Someone could take you up on that, sell you one share at $1000, but again you have the issue of the trade not being reported to the tape. So you'd be out $1k, and the tape price would still be what it was.

KingPickle is on the right track with regulations, but it's honestly a very huge topic. I can't speak knowledgeably on Reg NMS, though that would be the regulation that governs best execution.

One more note, if you are asking this because you own 1000 shares of a $1 stock, and you'd like to be a paper millionaire, know that entering an order for the purpose of having a higher price than normal appear on the tape could be considered 'marking the close,' which is considered manipulative, and your broker might have a number of questions for you. With liquid stocks, marking the close isn't necessarily a big deal. With OTCBB stocks, it can be a big issue. Large share holders find it in their interest that the highest price is reflected on their statements. If they own, say, 1,000,000 shares of a stock with a bid/ask of $.05/$.10 (illiquid stocks generally have wider spreads like this), their portfolio value varies wildly based on what the last executed price of that stock is. If the last traded price is $.05, the bid, the position is only worth $50,000. However, if the last executed price is $.10, the position is worth $100,000. To get that higher figure to show up on a statement, the owner could submit an order at the very end of the day to buy 100 shares (round lot, reported to tape) at the asking price ($.10), which would report the last traded price to the tape of $.10. If you were to enter an order for the purpose of reporting a specific price, it could be considered manipulative, and possibly illegal (depends on the scale, whether it was reported, and whether it has any impact on the market itself; generally, it is not a good idea to do this if you want to keep a brokerage account somewhere)."

2014-01-18 10:41:00,"i pulled this off of zh the other day, but i can't find his post atm, so here i go attempting to recreate the chart... it is kind of interesting to me how we have (at least up this point anyway) followed that of the year 2000 bull market peak... starting on the left of the chart you can see we had a pretty serious sized correction of -22% from the july '98 highs to oct '98 lows... then from the oct '98 lows we ripped +68% to the march 2000 highs... what followed after that was a pretty significant bear market correction of about -50% ending in oct 2002...
 
well, if we take a look at this current rally... you can see it's looking kind of looking eerily similar in nature, in the fact that we've seen that -22% correction in 2011, and have ripped +72% off those oct. '11 lows... in addition, both of these corrections of -22% each were reversed by a bullish monthly reversal... so overall, from a price action perspective, the trend is mature and is as stretched as it was in 2000... now, i'm not saying this is def. where this bull market dies... obviously, nobody knows for sure... but, let's just say for example that 1850.84 print that was saw last week was in fact the final high print put in on the spx of this bull market, and we go into a bear frenzy from here on out, well a -50% correction from this current level would bring us down to about 925ish on the s&amp;p... not too horrible, eh? =P

MySpace had a good run, this can't be dismissed, so to say that facebook outlasting it means anything would be naïve on my part. But that's sort of how I feel. I almost think its business model (stock value) is more likely to fall out of favor than its world popularity. I'm curious to see the numbers, including how old each site was when the successor had the same amount of active accounts as its predecessor. How long was MySpace the reigning champ, and how long has facebook worn the crown? Is it gaining power every day making it more difficult to surpass, or waiting for the next hot social networking site to crumble it? 

As far as Twitter is concerned, have you priced way out of the money, way in the future put options? "

2014-01-17 23:31:12,I think twitter has found a brand new way of communication that has actually stuck with mainstream America.

Then this facebook thing comes along, but it was for College kids only and was pretty simple in design.

Myspace got messy with too many ads and design issues, so everybody start flocking over to facebook when they opened the doors to the general public.

Will twitter, in search for greater revenues, start showing more ads? 

Will something else take its place?

2014-01-17 14:58:00,"Yeah, picking stocks means deciding if it's going to go up or down. You have a 50/50 chance, and if you wait long enough you'll probably be right eventually. 

To say ""I was right"" about shorting a stock that went up over 11 points after shorting - I don't know if that's being right. To have a huge expanded range candle, like it did this month, is completely out of the ordinary. Being that kind of ""right"" is likely to lose you quite a bit of money one day. Genreally shorting stock is not a long-term trading decision.

Making money at stocks is about timing the market and understanding what you are doing. 

Edit: I think that being ""right"" would entail knowing that the stock could go to 44.50 (which is what I said and it did) revaluating the stock at that price level. The stock obviously rolled over once it hit around 44.50. You could have ridden that down for a 20 point gain vs an 11 point drawdown for a 9 point gain. That's what I would call right."

2012-02-11 12:11:25,"Being bearish on AAPL is a dangerous game as this is one of the cheapest stocks around. TTM PE of 14, fwd PE of 10 ... And that is without consideration of the $100+ per share cash hoard. Where can you buy an 110% YoY growth stock with this much cash at such a low valuation? AAPL PE ratio is lower than the SP500 aggregate PE. 

Lots were waiting for a pullback to 420-430 after the gap up on jan 25. They didn't know that at 445, AAPL had a PE of 11.7, and was being valued less than the worst part of the 2008 crash.

It's tempting to look at price but price means nothing. Value is everything. Take a cold analytical approach to AAPL instead of following the herd and it's hard not to be bullish. 

If you want to be bearish, be bearish on AMZN. PE over 100, razor thin margins and declining revenues. If I'd short anyone it would be AMZN, but I won't, because the market can remain irrational longer than I can short AMZN. :)"

2012-02-10 14:30:22,"Agree with you when it comes to splits, any price action based on splits seems silly as there is no fundamental change occurring.

I'd like a 10:1 split with AAPL though. I like to use options as stock replacement (using very deep in the money LEAPs) and it's just annoying that I need tens of thousands of dollars per contract. A big split would offer some granularity for guys like me who are not dealing with millions and can easily throw around lots of 100 AAPL shares.

I've also heard the argument that a split would lessen the manipulation of AAPL price to suit option sellers, but I'm not as convinced about that."
2012-02-10 13:34:46,"The AAPL split rumor has been appearing ever since it crossed $200.

I would usually pass that off, but up here at $500-$600, AAPL may feel they are starting to alienate mom and pop investors who feel the stock is ""expensive"".

Im sure IF a split is ever announced, we will see a +10% rally. I hate those rallies, they make no sense at all, but hey, you have to let retail buyers in when its expensive!
"
2012-02-10 11:53:26,"Thanks for this!

Could be important fundamental changes taking place this month. The shareholders meeting is on Feb 23rd and it is widely rumored that there will be a dividend announced then.

Any kind of regular dividend, even one that yields very little, would create a lot of buying pressure as funds that are only allowed to purchase divvy funds would certainly load up on AAPL.

There's also rumor of a split taking place in this meeting - but those rumors have less credibility.
"
2012-02-10 10:30:15,"I'm not sure about using TA on AAPL. The stock seems to be controlled by options writers most weeks, unless there's an event type situation like earnings release.

Writing covered calls seems like free money when the stock is moving sideways all year. Then the stock goes on an absolute tear and of course it happens when you're not expecting it.

I actually bought back in this morning at 490.XX, so no profits to spend. :) AAPL is so fundamentally undervalued even at these prices, I simply can't think of a better place to put my money."

I cashed out 70% of my position today when it was in the low 495's. Been long since 368. Booked around 93k profit. I've never been so stressed out from making so much money.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I think it could have at least one more leg up before some profit taking. I'll be watching tomorrow very closely. I may write Feb ATM puts first thing in the morning."

My take on this is that the 20.50 level could be some resistance. The stock had a good push out of the teens after a bit of consolidation in the $18 range, this is the push higher that investors are being rewarded with.

I would not be chasing it here for new positions, buying on pull backs is always preferable.

All personal attacks aside it could be a combination of factors causing ZNGA to spring up faster than Regis Philbin on the Letterman's LateNight show:

* ZNGA owns most of the Social Gaming market on Facebook
* [12% of Facebook's revenue comes from Zynga](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaXiC0xRjo) (Source C|Net)
* ZNGA may seek out online gambling.
* Facebook's over hyped announcement on its IPO filing. (Just the filing with no clues on pricing and shares)
* EA's surprising performance (EA is the next threat to ZNGA when it comes to the Facebook market share and social gaming market share)
* RENN's (Chinese Facebook) performance earlier in the week

2012-01-25 11:49:11,"Risk is inherit in any investment. However, by doing your research, reading articles (be careful with this one, lots of people are full of crap), you can mitigate some of this risk and give yourself the best opportunity. Large Cap Stocks tend to have a lot more research put into them, so you will have more opportunities to read and get an idea of what you are getting yourself into. try going to nasdaq.com and typing in a stock symbol. You can see a lot of important information (P/E ration, 1 year target, eps, etc.) 

Large cap stocks afford a relatively safe investment. Consider AAPL. One of the largest companies on the NYSE, trades within a relatively stable range, and is unlikely to drop to drop very far, or go bancrupt. You can expect a good return with this stock, if you are willing to keep it long term. The biggest mistake new investors make (myself included) is to believe that if a stock loses value after you buy it, to immediately sell it. Don't do that! Especially if you are young and have a lot of time. 

To be fair, there are a lot of good reasons you might not want a large cap stock, for one, its important to diversify your portfolio with different types of stocks, and the further away from retirement you are, the more risk you can take. Some stocks don't pay dividends (like AAPL), which may make it unattractive for some investors. 

Basically, the larger the market valuation of the stock, the less risk you can assume (generally, of course there are exceptions, for instance CSCO tanked big last year, but is making its way back up.)

All the information you presented is public knowledge correct? That means, that information is already reflected in the stock price. You can't make money in the stock market being right, you have to be more right than everyone else. This is very important. Everyone knows that the games last year were bad, and the games this year are going to be good. This doesn't provide you with an edge. They had earnings on Aug 1st, the move may have had something to do with that, I haven't looked at any of the news so I'm not sure.

Possible to manage risk (depending on liquidity, in your case HEK skipped 10c at a time in the A/H so you'd probably be hitting a pretty big spread) As for an edge, I disagree, you had none. You were valuing the company based on OLD news with no idea what the new release would be like. They could have reported terrible numbers, gapped lower and they would still be undervalued per your argument. 

TL;DR you are betting on a random event, no edge."
2012-08-07 14:12:38,"Exploiting my edge was exactly what was intended. The odds seemed to be in favour as the stock seemed undervalued. Buying infront of earnings leads to mork risk, but at the same time with a post market conference call you get a larger reward as you aren't buying at the opening price when everyone else see's whats happening. Managing my risk is something I did poorly here i'll admit, but its not an impossiblity."
2012-08-07 14:07:50,"No, its not. You exploit your edge and manage your risk. You make trades when the odds (risk/reward) is in your favor. If you buy infront of earnings you can't do any of these things

The word confirmed is addressing the **target** not the actual breakout.  It doesn't mean we will breakout.  You aren't reading what I wrote correctly.  We need a strong close today to confirm a breakout.

2012-08-06 04:25:51,"No no no, I'm not saying it is cheap because it was once worth $15.  I'm saying that as a successful company at $15 a share, it sets a bit of a precedent of an upswing if things go back to the way they were, aka they don't put out crappy games (which is what has happened this last year).

All those factors are extremely important, and I'm going to take your post as a sobering reminder to make sure enough research into the company is done before taking any steps.

Cheers "
2012-08-05 23:07:51,"I would agree with your assessment on the most part, I'm not saying that stop loss loops cause trends, I just find that they extend them for a few days longer, depending on the particular market  of course.  "
2012-08-05 22:33:55,agree on the whippy movements.  It's been whippy because a new piece of news keeps coming out whipping the pps in the other direction.   This is the latest.  But assume not the last.  :)

2012-08-05 22:06:36,"To be honest, I believe all fundamentals are already baked into the price, I'm a pure technical trader so you are preaching to the choir on that point. 

Fundamentals don't drive stock prices, future expectations, guidance etc do. I saw a company last week report stellar earnings beat on eps and revs but guided lower for the upcoming quarter. Stock gapped down over 20% and stayed down there. 

Triggering stops etc are called feedback loops where stops are triggered at one price above a level which in turn cause the stops at the next price level to trigger etc basically a breakout or breakdown. However, these are inefficiencies that are corrected fairly quickly, they don't cause trends. I do this on a regular basis. I pay through offers or hit bids with more size than is shown trying to cause the break and scalp it. Trends on the other hand need much more to sustain themselves, there needs to be underlying demand (or supply) for a trend to continue in any given direction"

2012-08-05 21:26:39,"I am not sure if I read you right.  It sounds like you are saying it's cheap now at $8 because it once worth $15.  If so, that's very dangerous.  Do you actually think no one knows about the new games that will be coming out?  Do you think managements who thinks they will do poorly don't know they have new games coming out?  Do you think the company is undervalued because you have some special insight the managements don't?  Are you aware the company doesn't make any money, that in fact, it loses money?

How much money do you think the new games will bring?  And how much does it cost the company to develop, market and sell those games?

Also, the fundamentals of companies changes all the time, it doesn't mean it's been overvalued for years just because price is now lower.
"
2012-08-05 21:18:51,"Of course it's correlated -- spreads can still grow in two highly correlated assets. Take a look at the first graph here: http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/1027/how-are-correlation-and-cointegration-related

Those two prices are pretty tightly correlated (correlation coefficient &gt;0.8) and the spread is still blowing up. 

But yes, you're right that he can also buy protective puts. I forgot to mention that shorting SPY means that he'll have to pay dividends, so it's not ideal in that regard. "
2012-08-05 19:53:19,"I see your point now, what I was trying to say is that price moves because of things besides fundamentals.  And even when fundamentals are being released and traded on its often times used as an event to unload or load up on stock contrary to the fundamental logic/reason.

Edit: I have at times noticed that securities continue their trend contrary to fundamentals. Granted that I don't know what every trader is thinking, I can't help but attribute the price action to manipulation/bullying or people exiting their positions via mental stops rather than stop market orders."
2012-08-05 19:31:27,"I didn't say it was. I just said there was too much risk involved in holding a position over the weekend on either side.

2012-08-05 19:27:28,not looking good for the longs. The investment is going to extremely dilute share value
2012-08-05 19:25:25,Your initial comment didn't make any of the points you just made. Your original post only referred to temporary inefficiencies in the market which are fairly quickly sorted out. This doesn't have anything to do with price leading fundamentals.
2012-08-05 19:21:23,"yes, if you read the comments above we we're referring to the short side. Looking at the news coming out now, not particularly good for the longs either.

Also- Buyout doesn't mean the stock price is going to increase, they are (were) in bad situation, they could have been forced to accept pennies on the dollar leaving investors holding the bag."
2012-08-05 19:18:46,"saw that, but you do understand that this does not mean the share price is going to increase right?"
2012-08-05 18:38:49,"Its tricky for sure.  I believe that they were a $15/share company, and are undervalued right now at $8 a share.  The massive effect these games could (should?) have on the gaming world this holiday season is the difference between an $8/share and $10+/share to me.

If these guys were $15/share putting out games like they have, and are only worth $8/share while still putting out these massive games, then I'll be wrong, because they would have been overvalued at $15 for years.."

2012-08-05 18:15:04,"oh, you meant if you're shorting. At first I thought you meant a buyout would be bad for long."
2012-08-05 17:50:44,if you follow CJP84's advice it would be. A buyout would send the shares up considerably so if you're shorting it then you'd be screwed
2012-08-05 17:07:21,"Think of it in the context of a prediction market on a binary event and it makes more sense. Obama to win the presidency is 5.80/10.00 on Intrade, so the market has placed a 58% expected value on him winning the presidency. If I was really sure of myself I might actually rephrase Murphy and state it as ""market price is the sum of the known fundamentals plus the expected value of unknown fundamentals"". Of course since they are unknown, it's the focus of speculation . Speculate and the price action is determined by how many willing participants are on either side at the given price."
2012-08-05 16:49:47,"Agreed, I'll probably start accumulating a short next week depending on which way we drift on Monday. It's like people just get tired of hearing their revenue source problems and so they choose to forget about it."

2012-08-05 16:07:37,you saying a buyout would be bad?
2012-08-05 15:18:59,"The price action that is occurring due to ""unknown"" fundamentals is just speculation, some of it is manipulative some of it is not. It could be a dumb trader trying to get a big position in in a very short time.  It could be a thin market that is easily manipulated. It could be a number of algos working to collect/distribute low or high prices.  Fundamentals of the underlying security isn't the only thing that drives prices. lets say there is some fundamental info about company x and trader y purchases x amount based on that info.  The person on the opposite side of that trade isn't necessarily trading on fundamentals. They could be offering based simply on price or size, most likely a combination of the two.  The question the OP is asking is how can prices change when there is no new information to trade on? Or as OP worded it how do prices change to the unknown.  Well if it's not known then its changing for a different reason.  Are you currently changing your lifestyle based on unknown future events of your life? "
2012-08-05 15:13:03,the key here is if you know it everyone else knows it. All the info on future games including pre-order info etc is all discounted into the price. Wait for it to show you that the trend has changed before committing capital
2012-08-05 15:06:27,this is not what the OP is asking.
2012-08-05 13:43:28,"&gt; They under performed over the last 2 quarters, driving their stock down over 50% since Feb, and lowered their guidance for 2013

Sounds like the company has not been doing well, and the management does not expect it to do well in the future.  Why do you disagree with the management's assessment?
"
2012-08-04 23:48:58,I bought 300 shares at 7.82. Lots of room for growth imo. 
2012-08-04 22:11:03,"The thing is that people have a tendency to make biased predictions, and the ones who are good and have a good track record tend to have more money and thus move the market more. So 95% of people might think that earnings will beat expectations, but 5% who are really good and making educated guesses, use more information, or have a better mousetrap will short so hard because they think they will miss expectations, that it can move the market.

Another is something like the commodities market. Right after QE is announced everyone pours all their money into commodities (pretend you agree that they would), even though the fundamentals of the dollar hasn't changed yet (or is known yet) people have reacted by raising the price of all commodities. And even once everyone is in, before a dollar has been printed, the price will go up further once it is (because commodities go up when money supply does). "
2012-08-04 18:41:17,The order book can be manipulated to knock out other holders of stocks/futures.  In other words market makers and others with advantageous margin requirements will change the order book (what they are willing to buy and sell at) and try to  force the stock or future to trade near a price where there might be stops.  Once those stops are hit the market maker will start making a market back towards where supply and demand are neutral.
2012-08-04 17:45:53,"I view it as the price, and thus technicals, can factor in events / market conditions before you can fully quantify the full extent of the news on the company's balance sheet or cash flows.  You typically have to wait for a 10-Q to come out to know for certain what the fundamentals are for a company, but you only get 4 of those a year.  In between earnings, you have to rely on watching things like demand for a company's product, increased competition, price levels of their products, etc.  The price of a stock will generally factor these things in before you get a 10-Q.  The same goes for black swan events... everyone knew BP would be materially impacted when it had the oil spill in the gulf a couple years ago, but you couldn't see it on the company's balance sheet yet (and probably still can't!)  The market, however, knew it would have some affect and reacted accordingly.  The market will often over or underestimate the extent of events like this until the fundamentals are fully known, but they tend to be pretty spot on in knowing when good or bad things are going to get reported for a company's next earnings statement."
2012-08-04 16:19:12,"I haven't read the book, but this vaguely sounds like a description of price action.  Anything unknown is speculation based on previous events and current events which include price action."

2012-08-03 13:31:44,"Thanks for the heads up on the other post, I've been itching to talk about this with more people. There was a [thread](http://redd.it/xih1s) 2 days ago on /r/investing that talked about this a little bit. I had a pretty similiar analysis and plan (although I am also a beginner), about buying now and riding the hype and B2 sales, and then backing out before the holidays.

The two main things I focused on were B2 and GTA5 (How could you forget GTA!?). Based on the preorders and hype (and a personal bias towards loving the first) I think B2 will deliver and get them a lot of sales. All of this will be happening right amidst the marketing campaign for both GTA5 and Bioshock. I think this will all be great for the company and result in a gain. When B2 dies down and the Hoidays roll around, the sales for both of these games will come in and I think they will see an increase or decrease in stock price depending on how strong they are. It is too far to tell the quality of the games, but I have an eerie feeling they won't perform too well, in line with the console market as a whole. So, I bought earlier this week and plan on selling during the holiday hype and after B2 dies down a bit; so late september to october.

They are one of my main companies for the upcoming season, as I see them as undervalued with a great potential for profit."

"
2012-10-24 07:31:21,Thank you!!!
2012-10-23 23:02:15,"Some random thoughts for you:

I would start with the book, ""Investing for dummies"", which is a good overview of the basics of investing.

Then read, ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham - who was Warren Buffet's mentor.  (Warren Buffet being one of the most successful investors ever)

At 16, probably the best investment you can make is in your education.  I don't mean ""get a degree"", I mean ""learn all you can"", of which the easiest route is school.  

Also, think like an investor, in that you buy things or put your money in places that return more money.  Every penny you spend think, ""How is this going to come back to me?""

As far as returns on investment goes - If you do better than 10% in a year, you are doing better than most.  However, you can sometimes get lucky and double or triple your money in a year, or unlucky and loose it.  I kind of see it like a mix of educated guesses and gambling, where the odds on your side, and the more knowledge and thought you put into it, the better the odds are, but they are still odds and not a sure thing.

My best investment was starting a business.  That gave me enough money, that I can play the stock market and such with a portion of it in which I can afford to loose."
2012-10-23 21:44:22,"Since Amazon is a major UPS shipper, is this a prelude to poor Amazon earnings Thursday?"
2012-10-23 19:04:28,"For sure people are going to stop buying it.  It's not a necessity and there are alternatives.  The only question is how many people will stop and to what extend.  Some may stop completely, others would buy less of it.

We can't know for sure until the numbers come in, but it's a factor investors cannot ignore.  So we have a sell off.
"
2012-10-23 15:08:20,"Are people really going to stop buying it though? From what I've read it's all about caffeine overdosing which can happen with a number of drinks. I can't imagine their target market being that sensitive to this, there's nothing dangerous about it unless consumed in massive amounts and even then it's probably only life threatening for people with a pre-existing heart condition."
2012-10-23 13:45:28,""" United Parcel Service Inc. UPS +2.78% reported a drop in third-quarter earnings despite a rise in package volume, as soft international trade and a growing preponderance of low-priced shipments from online shopping damped results.

The Atlanta-based delivery company also booked a big pension-restructuring charge in the quarter.

UPS said package volume climbed 2.9% overall, lifted by a 3.7% rise in the U.S. Business-to-consumer shipping, meaning e-commerce, ""was absolutely the primary driver of the volume growth"" domestically, Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said on an earnings conference call, with business-to-business volume ""slightly negative.""

So because the drop due to a dividend is instantaneous and not gradual, there is no trading in between.  A 50 dollar stock closing paying two dollars dividend opens up at 48 the next day.  Therefore, your 49 dollar stop loss will see its under 49, and execute a market sell order and it will sell at whatever the market bid is, probably around 48."

2012-12-09 16:29:43,"For starters, your stop loss will be executed at price after dividend drop, so it would be $4.90 in your case (if there is enough liquidity to do so). Because this drop in price is instantaneous, so no gain from long.
For short position you are obligated to pay dividend to the person you borrowed stock from, so no gain there.

I think it's interesting that the SPY technicians in here seem to have the same bearish outlook on SPY as I do on the QQQ. There are way too many good reasons to be short here from a technical standpoint.

That being said, employment data this week, FOMC minutes next week, there's plenty of data for the markets to operate off of. And of course all of the fiscal cliff stuff we've been hearing 24/7.. with all this uncertainty, I don't think the big guys are going to be in risk-on mode, so I see a drop lower from here.

If big news comes out that the fiscal cliff is solved (lol) then there's your rally. A stock market breakdown might expedite those deliberations. It's also December so there's gonna be profit booking and alpha chasing.

Lots of stuff to think about but man, 66 on the QQQ is such an ""obvious"" stopping point..

2012-12-04 08:10:28,"One way, as you mentioned, is ETFs, but a purer way would be to just go long a S&amp;P straddle (buy a put and call option). You've got no real notional exposure with the exception of your premium, and any large swing in volatility should put you in the money. One thing to be wary of with this kind of investment is you do have theta exposure, which means that the premium you paid (and own, if you want to look at it that way) slowly degrades over time to expiry, so it is a timing trade as well.

Before you would want to do anything like this, or even open a margin account, I would advise anyone to be fully aware of the risks involved in option or even short trading."

The Technicals

S&amp;P Analysis;

Looking at the low volume up-thrust Monday as a poor buying climax to foreshadow an equally poor pull-back.

While price can continue lower, I suspect downside to be limited to 192 / 193 previous Flat Base pattern should be strong volume support.

Intraday volume confirming Friday bullish daily inside candle with signs of hourly climax / stop volume candles.

Weekly consolidation unable to get outside previous candle closing with a higher low is bullish.

 

US Treasuries (TLT) still in trend-line support and suspect will remain slightly bullish this week.

 

USD previous top (resistance) coming in as support to complete ABC, on above average volume, before continuing upward is my guess.

 

1.35 Euro proving to be pretty solid volume support and suspect a neutral range bound price with slightly bullish bias (1.35 - 1.36)"

2014-06-14 14:37:20,"&gt; In most circumstances it seems like you would have to be stupid to email someone about specific trades, but even telling someone privileged information might not even necessarily be illegal if you didn't know they were planning to try and gain financially from it. 

That's my understanding of it as well - otherwise bankers would never be allowed to take their phones out of the office, since they are full of privileged information.
"
2014-06-14 14:20:55,"&gt; If you were walking down the street and stepped on a piece of paper that happened to be some notes belonging to an insider and traded on the information not knowing that it was undisclosed, then I don't believe it's a crime.

I actually don't know. I've used the hypothetical situation before that you could be sitting at a restaurant and hear some shit at the table next to you from two executives talking about a merger being 95% approved or something before it comes public. The answer I got was essentially ""it would be impossible to prosecute you because there would be no evidence that you had been anything but lucky"".

And that's what it comes down to a lot of the time - prosecutorial difficulty. It is notoriously difficult to prove insider trading if you take any level of precaution against getting caught, and the DA does not like to lose cases on insider trading - especially because they require a huge expense."
2014-06-14 14:09:29,"&gt; Insider trading is **only illegal if you sign something explicitly** designating information you're given as sensitive **or if you disclose market sensitive information without permission**; 

This is what you said. This is explicitly, unconditionally false. If you knowingly receive privileged information and proceed to act on it knowing that it gives you an advantage in the market, that will constitute insider trading.

Do you think that Phil Mickleson has signed some kind of privileged information agreement with Dean Foods and Clorox that he has potentially violated and is thus under the investigation of the SEC? 
"
2014-06-14 11:34:02,It is pretty unusual to be charged with insider trading if you are not an officer of the company in question.
2014-06-14 07:28:53,"Even that would be way too slow. You need millisecond reaction times. Basically, you have to get lucky and be staring at the stock just as the news hits and have very fast reflexes or be in it already. If you are using anything other than a serious professional trading platform (I.e. if you are trading with Thinkorswim, Scottrade, etrade, etc) you will never be fast enough even if you see the news instantly. By the time you read the first three words the opportunity will be gone. 

Even the fastest direct market access platforms are too slow to compete with the funds and hfts that already know. Good example: I grabbed some DARA today in the aftermarket as I saw a ton of volume coming in. I reacted pretty fast and have a professional trading platform and I still got filled like 5% higher than the first buyers... Plus the news didn't even show up for me until like a minute later when the stock was up another 10% lol

There is however opportunity to hunt for companies that are good buyout candidates if you're willing to do the research and you have enough patience to wait for the potential merger. Personally I would rather not tie up my capital on that kind of gamble. There are better and easier ways to make money in the market IMO "
2014-06-14 07:02:25,"Just guessing. If you really wanted to, sure you could, for example, look at tech companies that are new but have a niche product gaining popularity. But you don't know when the buyout will happen, if ever. Or, just write a script to scan all finance news for keywords like ""announce"" ""merger"" etc and send a text to your phone.

You are asking for an answer that anyone with a good and easy solution would never volunteer. "
2014-06-14 05:43:33,"So where are you getting your information on this subject from? Are you working at Goldman Sachs or just guessing, because if you are merely guessing your opinion is meaningless"
2014-06-14 02:28:45,"This is false. If you have reason to believe that it is privileged information it is insider trading. See: Martha Stewart, the golfer who's currently under investigation, etc. "
2014-06-14 00:38:10,"What?

Insider trading is only illegal if you sign something explicitly designating information you're given as sensitive or if you disclose market sensitive information without permission; receiving and acting on said info is actually not illegal if you can manage to get it because it wouldn't technically be the *primary* source.

The market is reacting to a press release on the DowJones Newswire that everyone sees, there might be some activity beforehand but this change doesn't reflect much other than the market cap's adjustment to the offer price (or slightly below)

If you feel good about the acquisition there's still a small margin for a merger arb."

2014-06-13 22:05:13,"It's only insider trading if they can prove it..........

But you can't really do this just by looking at the news. Firms will know the moment the story is released, or even slightly beforehand. They just won't make their moves until the story is released so it can't look like they had any knowledge beforehand.

I don't think it is a good strategy to be looking to make money off of mergers. They don't happen that often, and without some form of ""connection"" you won't get in on the deal along with the firms."

I *do* have a question: Does your demo platform fill immediately, or does it simulate actual market action on your orders? (FIFO) One of the places I have seen traders get surprised is when they trade a demo platform and get immediate fills, and then move to real-money trading and find that their orders have to wait in line for others. If you are scalping, then timing is vital. You'll need a data feed that is lightning fast and completely accurate, plus order routing that gets you in and out as fast as possible. You're competing against co-located computers where milliseconds make the difference between the penthouse and the outhouse. Again, I sincerely hope you prove me wrong.

They got a TON of early funding from VC's and literally bought the most expensive office they could and just threw away so much money.

Revenues are shrinking, earnings are negative, and I see no signs of that changing based on their recent game launches.

2014-07-29 23:04:59,Yes ive accounted for that and since ive grown up in the heart of the Social media age (23 yrs old) I dont see Twitter lasting once the media stops using it. And for some reason It doesnt seem like a perfect model since there are a ton of people who dont use it. So I assume with in 1 yr it will peak and the next 2 years will be a slow decline and then probably something new will hit that will sink it or itll get taken over before then.

2014-07-29 20:10:23,"Sure, post updates! It's a bit of a mystery to me now.
If you can see the bid and ask, and even their size, that would be useful. In order to trade this, you should see something like the bid/ask spread is very high (like 20c), or the bid size around the ""normal"" price drops to zero. Basically to grab those apparent cheap shares, any bids between your low price and the normal price will have to be filled first. If the price actually drops 20c for a few secs (meaning a trade actually occurs at that lower level) there has to be suddenly no bids above that. This can happen if there's a huge spread, but with 43M shares traded today I just don't think that happened. I don't expect this to work."
2014-07-29 19:21:51,"Yes I was out @ 25% today. Could of squeezed another 5-6% but TWTR isnt a stock I would hold unless you really think its going to gain more active users.

2014-07-29 17:23:00,"Failing to find evidence that any such trades took place, I think they're fake. Google ""HFT fake quotes"" for explanations. I remember hearing about it a year or so ago, it sounded like a problem that was intended to be fixed, but for example some high frequency traders were placing huge numbers of fake bids and then immediately cancelling them. No shares were actually traded at the bids, but I guess the intention is to get other traders to think there is greater interest and change their orders. Perhaps you were seeing cancelled trades, or retracted (fake) Ask prices?

I would bet you have a higher chance of being scammed trying to trade an opportunity like this, than to make a couple hundred $. I think it more likely that someone could cause those dips and get a few $ from others who think they can exploit it. But I think it's more likely still that it's just some trade or data feed situation with no opportunity to trade it."
2014-07-29 17:22:03,"Thanks for the info.

I'm going to try setting a limit order tomorrow and see what happens.

I want to say it was a little after 12cst. I'll try to screenshot the next time I see it. I just happened to be watching RAD on the ScottradeElite screen when I saw the price drops. I had it set to 1sec updates. It lets me get down to 100 ticks updates. The screen moves too fast at that speed though."

2014-07-29 16:19:32,"I'd say so. It's also possible that the order would be partially filled (unless you make it ""all or none""). I would guess that this is more likely than a large order being fully filled, because if the 20c drops are anomalous, there might not be too many shares available at the lower price. It might incur extra commission if the order is repeatedly partially filled.  

\* The Scottrade website says ""Commissions are charged on a per order basis. Limit orders executed over multiple days and orders modified after partial execution on the same day will be treated as separate orders for commission calculation purposes."" --- So that sounds like a day limit order that is repeatedly partially filled will not be charged extra commission, with this broker.

\*\* Also, I don't see any 20c dips in google finances' 2-min candlestick chart for RAD??? Those prices might not have been available. I know that a lot of time in after-hours you can see huge dips or spikes --- something to do with brokers settling trades made earlier in the day or something like that --- but no shares would be available to trade there."
2014-07-29 15:30:09,"really I intend to hop on it at the IPO price and then maybe exit a few days later.  People usually hate airlines.  Except for Virgin, Qantas, and to a lesser extent, SWA.  If I don't swoop in in time then it would be great if it dips a bit before I make my buy.

However, I think that once it hits the market, it will get some kind of hype boost by like 20-30% over the next few days (a richard branson company is not as sexy as elon musk, but not far behind).  Then I promptly exit."

2014-03-16 15:58:30,there was nothing confirmed during the day news wise. but short squeeze or icahn rumors have been thrown around. Along with possible M&amp;A activity
2014-03-16 15:57:21,Pretty good trading in this one. easy 3 points off the open.
2014-03-16 13:42:09,They are designed for day trading. They can simply revalue.
2014-03-16 00:55:24,"Yeah carl icahn is in this.

Almost got in this kinda regret now"
2014-03-15 23:27:35,"Until shots are fired, I really don't think this is a big deal.  We'll see tomorrow night when futures open but nothing really happened yet."
2014-03-15 22:14:27,"&gt; There is significant worry that the recent decline in copper and China's economic woes might be the start of a wider correction. There are certainly some concerns reflected in the market internals: fewer new highs overall, and no Dow Jones Industrial Average components having hit new highs.

&gt;Still, it's hard to see imminent signs of a significant market drop. The advance/decline line is still near a new high, and that usually turns down well in advance of a significant market correction. 

Things are heating up in Ukraine this weekend, lets see how Monday looks."
2014-03-15 14:37:11,"Yeah it closed well so it should gap up I'd think. I probably should have just held my 2k from $3.05 but sometimes my day trading mentality clouds my judgement. 95% of the time I am right on these picks within a couple weeks, lol "
2014-03-15 12:33:00,"As long as you have a sound trading philosophy, you should be fine. 

I like your picks, did well with SYN. I'm still holding on (from 3.07), AH was low volume but the price was up to 3.25 at one point, past the 3.20 52wk high so I hope that's a good sign for Monday."

2014-03-14 23:31:16,"No doubt it's been shaky for me. I got in at $5, went down but I stuck with it and bought more, then it went to the upper 7s, now it's back to 5.76. I'm waiting until the World Cup is done to see if I should keep it or not. Great find at just under $3, good vision."
2014-03-14 23:04:36,"Thanks,

That's the consensus I've come to, from what I've gathered online.


I use questrade like the guy above, and he didn't have any problems by the sounds if it.

But I will double check "
2014-03-14 22:31:06,"Eh, I don't care about the money. What I care about is following the system which I did perfectly. We can't help it if a stock squeezes us out, all we can do is continue to follow our system. I am still positive for the month like always so no big deal, and it's only the 14th. If you're not taking losses it means you're not taking risk. Risk is required for reward, and big losses that are controlled mean big rewards are coming. I had 3k SYN and 1.5K FSYS, as well as 2K SID and all three trades failed. FSYS slipped a good 9 cents which on 1.5K shares is $135. SYN slipped 2.5c which on 3k shares is $75. So between those two, (including two adds on each and one sell on each) I paid $40 in commission and took an extra $210 in loss due to the slippage, plus FSYS was a squeeze and SYN was a run on stops, lol. My max loss is normally $500 for a day and if I eliminate the extra commission and slippage from those losses, I would have been at $515 which is fine. 

I trust in my system and know that these two trades are just an anomaly. I did everything I was supposed to do which is all I am able to do. Most people after days like this will scale back and run away for the next week so that when the same opps present themselves and work 10x over the next week they will only make back their $1k, but as long as I stay aggressive and consistent then these things can present themselves the same next week and I will end up $5k overall. I'm actually about to go do some trade reviews and post all my wins/losses for the last 1.5 months on Tradervue, since I haven't updated it in a while. Will be good for you guys to see how even during a slump you can still at the very least prevent loss so that when markets are hot you can capitalize. 

Besides, my CUR swing from $3.70 ripped today and I am pretty confident that sucker is just gettin started! Redemption will be miiiiine!"

2014-03-14 22:05:02,"12% of the float short made for a good squeeze. Trade actually got halted for a short time when it hit 16.54.
"
2014-03-14 21:48:59,"I don't, however my initial thinking was to buy in while low and count on the marketing bump during the world cup. Keep in mind, I'm completely new at this, and my logic may be greatly flawed. I would imagine they're simply going through normal fluctuation's of highs and lows. Once commercials start showing, and players start scoring, I'd be very surpassed to see it continue to fall.  "
2014-03-14 21:27:52,"BTW the company has a Price/Cash ratio of close to 1. This means that GOL has $4 in cash on their balance sheet. You are getting the rest of the business for free. 

Keep in mind that they have a lot of long-term debt. But it isn't of any immediate concern as the company has no solvency issues.

Technically, the chart is throwing up all kinds of buy signals for me. "
2014-03-14 21:20:45,"GOL. It's the official airlines for the world cup. Fundamentally all airlines are doing great globally. GOL hasn't been picked up in this bull run because of the Brazil exposure. If you look at finances, the company is pretty solid. Brazil is a great tourist spot and the even the local middle class is growing and spending more. All of those are great for GOL. I expect it to go up significantly over the next year. The soccer world cup and being the official airlines is a just an added bonus for the company to get more publicity and appreciation. I bought it at 3.50 last year and then sold out at 5.50. Now I'm waiting for it to dip below 4 before I go all in. The stock closed at 4.10 today. So, I'm actually hoping to pick up a lot of shares next week. "

Does this apply if you are Canadian (buying from canada) and your trading stocks on a us exchange? Or is it only if your based in the states?"

My trading skills are probably far below the average par for this subreddit but nothing?  I just don't understand how a stock can gain 6+% with no news or reasoning."
2014-03-14 20:37:13,I bought it because I wanted exposure to the soccer market and firmly believe that the entire industry is poised for great growth all over the world?
2014-03-14 20:14:33,"Wow..... you bought it because it is soccer related? Anyway.... 

It should fluctuate depending on how many players they sign. If they sign players before the world cup and the players turn out to have a great world cup you will see the stock rise. Also, all these people above me commenting on one player dominating or getting hurt is utterly ridiculous. MANU is a huge entity it does not simply rely on one player. One player getting hurt is minimal risk especially when considering insurance policies cover them. A player having an amazing world cup does not give great out look for the longterm future of united... he could get hurt in the first game of the season for united and be out..."

Taking this big loss means I was taking lots of risk which is what I need to do in order to make this account blow up the way I want. Controlled aggression, not recklessness - so I am all good!

As long as S&amp;P stays above the lows made in early Feb. So, I'm looking for support at close to 1750 level. If we break below that, I'd start getting very worried.

I agree it will remain volatile, but if the outlook for the next few years seems good in terms of economical recovery that wouldn't be a major problem. I wouldn't put any money I need to recover on the short term. "

No doubt that there has been a good run recently, but check out todays -2% move, those markets are pretty damn volatile!

Like I said though, actually explaining the patterns is where experience comes in and you just learn over time. Looking up common technical chart patterns is a good place to start and just see if you can identify some, whether they are on a daily chart, monthly or even a 1 min chart.

For example knowing not to trade MSFT and knowing to trade KNDI instead, or understanding the difference between how something like CAMT or VNDA or SUPN will move vs something like TSLA or AMZN or ANV.

2012-06-26 09:44:30,"My 2 cents on Ford. [CHARTS WHOO!!](http://imgur.com/HRsBY)


I love the company and their CEO, Alan Mullally. I will buy Ford again for my long portfolio, but not any time soon. 


Ford right now looks like its consolidating. Until I see a heavy volume movement, I'm sitting on the sidelines. I got burned  in March after I bet it would break its initial 12-13 dollar consolidation and hit mid-teens. If we break past support, Ford will test $9 again. To be honest, i think this bear market stretches into late July / early August.


Another concern is Europe. I think about 30% of Fords sales reside in the EU and I am very hesitant with the situation over there. "
2012-06-26 02:00:01,"I don't see any particular reason why Ford would break out of its current trading range (~10-10.80) in a direction other than where the market as a whole goes. You could try to make a trade by picking it up now resting at the bottom of the range, but I really don't like to see a stock test support 3 times in a little over a month like this.  It also has a falling 50 DMA to contend with near the top of the trading range this time.

For what it's worth, I'll give you my take on trading NBG. I've been trading full-time for more than a year now, so I'm still a rookie - but I'll gladly share what little experience I have.

From a technical (trend, support/resistance) point of view, NBG is still in a downtrend on the daily with no indication of reversal. On the hourly, the current price is at the top end of a support area. So if you wanted to bet on a trend reversal, I would want to see some consolidation here and look to enter near the bottom of the support area (ideally around 1.45) with a very tight stop loss. Plan would be to take half off around 1.95 and let the other half run.

If it drops further, you could also look for a double-bottom and enter around 1.15, again with a tight stop. Take half off around 1.50 and let the rest run.

If it looks to test 2 again, you could watch for a 2 break and trend reversal, although I personally would not do this given the current market. I'd rather short it near 2 for a quick scalp.

From a fundamental point of view, I can't really argue for or against the trade - there's simply too much conflicting information out there for my taste, and a hell of a lot of uncertainty. 

In any case, I see no compelling reason to enter at the current price. Even if it's just a gamble, why not wait for a better entry?"

The finance minister they just hired a couple weeks ago resigned yesterday to nurse medical issues, probably further hurting the stock. I think it's above 10c in part because of the following quote. 

 ""There are some very practical difficulties with this. For one, over 17 percent of working Greeks are on the public payroll. According to people familiar with the matter in Greece, nearly all payments to these public employees are made into Greek banks. What’s more, pensioners and others on public assistance receive payments into Greek bank accounts. 

At any given time, then, there will be a sizable amount of euros flowing into Greek bank accounts. Even if some of this is immediately withdrawn and sent abroad, a snap shot of the Greek banking system will make this flow of deposits appear to be a steadfast stock. 

But there’s another reason some Greeks aren’t withdrawing their deposits—they plan to benefit from a devaluation. A Greek who owes a large euro denominated debt to a foreign bank or business would benefit from the devaluation of that debt. Under any likely scenario of a currency change, Greek courts would consider the debt redenominated into the new devalued drachma.""

2012-06-22 23:56:17,"I'd add one thing. Pinning has more to do with volume coming in on opex Friday on specific strikes. On opex day, option hedge unwinding will cause price fluctuations. On some Fridays, you have high volume option activity at the same strike for both put and call. When this happens, you have stock price being squeezed from both directions into that one strike price. That's when you sometimes see Friday closing prices on Aapl ""pinned"" to a strike.

The above is just an interesting phenomenon, and not very useful in terms of putting money to work.

What I use is max OI for put and call. When PPS runs down into the highest put OI (say AAPL at 570), then put holders' options will have gained a lot of value, and they will cash out for big profits. This will cause option sellers to buy back shares of AAPL as they unwind their hedges, putting buying pressure on the stock.

Opposite true when stock price runs up too hard, say AAPL at 600. Many that own 600 calls will cash out, and option sellers will sell AAPL shares to unwind their hedges, putting selling pressure on the stock.

For AAPL, this phenomenon mostly has a negative effect on the stock, since it almost always has more calls being bought on it than puts, so the effect is lopsided.

My way to take advantage of this is to realize the effect of option open interest on AAPL and sell covered calls, knowing there is a low probability it will blow past the high OI strikes without significant selling pressure bringing it back down before opex Friday."

2012-06-22 23:00:33,"I love selling options more than most, but let me give those who don't understand the reasoning behind what you're doing.

Stocks tend to gravitate towards the options with the heaviest open interest.  There are several reasons, but every time an option is sold, the larger firms all buy stock if calls are sold or sell it if puts are sold.  More options seem to be paid up for than sold in a stock like Aapl (a lot of the reason being the margin required to trade it by the average investor encourages options buying, not selling), so when a call is bought in massive volume, more than likely the firms are racing to buy stock in order to hedge since they are usually looking to stay neutral and make money on spreads.  When this happens, stock goes up of course, and usually continues to trend.  When/if those options go ITM, you'll see the buyers selling their longs, and thus the other side can get out and sell their stocks, causing the stock to go down.  This is why you see lots of stocks ""pin"" on expiration near high OI options."

It is simply one way to try and quantify a blend of market fundamentals and human psychology based on historical data.  

I started off as a fundamental only investor, and found that while I was picking mostly decent stocks, I could've had significantly better entry points in many cases.  I studied Technical Analysis (still am; I certainly don't know everything), and it has helped me find better times to buy the stocks on my radar.  I don't always follow the rules, there's absolutely times when a valuation gets so low that I'll buy before waiting for a technical signal.

I always tell people starting off in options that the big money lies in the selling of options, not the buying. Having time work in your favor is the greatest advantage.

2012-06-22 16:47:21,"Yup. I don't use charts at all have put in successful trades every week. I'm happy to explain what I do.

I hold a large position in AAPL via .90 delta Jan'14 LEAPs. I hold these because it is my opinion that AAPL is severely mispriced to the downside (lower PE than SP500, ridiculous low PEG, PE &amp; PE are even crazier when you back out cash from PPS). All fundamentals, zero use of charts.

The above is more investment than trade, though I see it as just a very long time horizon trade, or a trade I've yet to close.

Every week I sell covered calls against my deep-in-the-money LEAPs. I determine at what strike to sell my calls by looking at the option open interest, and selling one strike higher than the highest OI call strike.  AAPL is a stock with massive option volume, and tends to be controlled by delta hedging done by big option sellers. Search for articles by Travis Lewis on Seeking Alpha, he is a pro at this, and his findings are statistically validated.

I also open long-dated bull put spreads on major dips, using historical PE ranges and AAPL's earnings forecasts to determine high probability price ranges.

When you focus on knowing where a stock price WONT be, as opposed to where it WILL be, suddenly a whole world of profit opportunity opens up before you, mostly involving the selling of options."

Not to shoot you down in your inquiry here, but we get a ""durr TA is stupid/magic"" posts at least once a month. 

All the biggest investment firms, GS, MS, BAC etc... ALL have technical analysts working for them. Even Cramer does charting on his Tuesday shows.

You acknowledge that it's an arc pointing out resistance levels, with no predictive capabilities, and implying nothing about the future. What, then, is the benefit to this type of analysis? Can you use the information in this drawing to put some money to work? From what I understand you are saying, you cannot.

Furthermore, what is a resistance level? I can see local maxima and places where the stock dropped off. But, zooming into different time scales will change these values dramatically. Does a resistance level have a solid definition (either financial or mathematical) or is it a subjective notion?

Almost all chart TA seems to boil down to ""magic"" for me, any way I look at it. "
2012-06-22 15:08:57,"&gt;I just have very strong opinions when it comes to this so I probably come off as a dick; that is not my intent.

Not at all, you can as anti-TA as you wish, nobody is asking you to believe anything.

Drawing an arc, a rectangle, a line or any other shape and saying ""this is what the market will do!"" is not what TA is about.

Im simply pointing out that this arc has been a resistance level to every single rally since 2009.

Will it continue to be a resistance level going foward? I dont know, nobody knows. We are not wizards, we can not tell the future. 

However, should we rally and near this arc again, and should market internals be weak, and  should market fundamentals be deteriorating (consumer sentiment, housing, earnings) you can bet that I will be leaning towards the bear side rather than the bull side.

TA is not about drawing a line and dictating what the market should do. If that is your understanding of it, then you do not understand it.

Obama, or any democrat going into office, will cause a rise in assault rifle purchases out of fear of another Clinton-era ban.  In 2007 the price on AR-15s went through the roof, as did ammo and magazines, and that's if you could even find one.  Even though Obama did nothing in the way of banning weapons and even loosened some restrictions, the GOP is stirring up fears of a new more radical Obama once he doesn't have to worry about reelection.  I've already seen people starting to horde the lower receivers(the only part of the weapon that is considered the ""gun"" and the only part that gets banned).  S&amp;W is a popular maker of mid-range AR-15s(called the M&amp;P 15).  Ruger also makes an AR-15 but from what I have seen at the range it is not as popular.  "

CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — Sturm Ruger &amp; Co.’s announcement that it would stop taking orders until it clears an enormous backlog is just one more demonstration that the boom times continue for the American firearms business.

Late Wednesday, the company RGR +12.18%   said that in the first quarter, it had received orders for more than 1 million units. And despite “efforts to increase production rates, the incoming order rate exceeds our capacity to rapidly fulfill these orders,” Sturm Ruger said. 

The company, which makes a wide variety of rifles, pistols and revolvers, also said that it expects to “resume the normal acceptance of orders by the end of May.”

That sent Sturm Ruger’s shares up about 10% in trading Thursday. Rival Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp. SWHC +12.39%  also got a bump, its shares gaining about 4%.

For its part, when it released third-quarter results this month, Smith &amp; Wesson forecast sales of $395 million to $400 million for all of fiscal 2012, up from an already-increased "

Tyically, yes, but as you said, if the market pulls back so will CVX. You also have the possibility of a rising dollar to consider. Thats why you want to try get in as close to a support level, put in your stops and see what happens.

The little spill they've got going in Brazil doesn't sound like a major concern, but is it? Are the Brazillian fields a huge part of what they do?

2012-03-21 17:08:56,"AAPL is set to earn about $50/share by the end of this fiscal year. FY2011 it was $28. FY2010 it was $15.

Say instead of growing 90-100% in earnings per share, FY2013 things slow down massively to 50%. That means 2013 EPS would be $75. 

2014? Let's say growth is continuing to slow down, this time to 20%. That gives us $90.

1650 divided by 90 gives us a PE of 18.

Given the above quick math, I'd say 1650 in 3 years is perfectly reasonable, if not a bit conservative. I seriously doubt AAPL growth will slow so severely when their market share remains in single digits for handsets, and tablets are non existent in terms of global penetration.

I think by then EPS could be 120-150, but I'm way more bullish on AAPL than the average person."

2014-09-21 15:18:52,"Cramer started investing in the stock market during his time at law school.[5] Cramer began promoting his holdings by leaving stock picks on his answering machine, impressing The New Republic owner Martin Peretz, who gave him $500,000 to invest; Cramer earned Peretz $150,000 in two years.[8]

His track record helped Cramer obtain employment in 1984 as a stockbroker with Goldman Sachs' Private Wealth Management[13] division. Cramer's success in this position led him to found his own hedge fund, Cramer &amp; Co. (later Cramer, Berkowitz, &amp; Co.), in 1987. The fund operated out of the offices of hedge fund pioneer Michael Steinhardt's Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz &amp; Co., and early investors included Eliot Spitzer (a Harvard classmate, one of his oldest friends, and former Governor of New York who resigned),[14] Brill, and Peretz.[15]

During Cramer's tenure with the fund, from 1988 to 2000, he had one year of negative returns in 1998. The following year the fund returned 47%, and in 2000 28%, beating the S&amp;P 500 by 38 percentage points.[8] Cramer retired from his hedge fund in 2001, finishing with a 24% average annual return over 14 years and having ""routinely [taken] home $10 million a year and more.""[8] The fund was taken over by his former partner Jeff Berkowitz after Cramer's retirement. During that time, he was also an ""editor at large"" for SmartMoney magazine, and was accused of unethically combining his investing and reporting activities when he bought stocks that he recommended just before the recommendation article came out, contributing to a $2 million personal gain.[16] Today, Cramer is barred by CNBC from trading stocks with his personal funds although he makes picks and sells his recommendations.

In 1996 Cramer co-founded TheStreet.com, Inc. with The New Republic editor Martin Peretz, one of his hedge fund's original clients. Cramer is currently a market commentator and adviser to the TheStreet.com, and is its second-largest shareholder.[1] Cramer also manages a charitable trust stock portfolio which is tied to TheStreet.com through a paid subscription service called the Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio.[8]

Cramer currently works on a new project as part of TheStreet.com called MainStreet.com.[citation needed] An earlier project, TheRoad.com, was not successful.[citation needed]

Cramer claimed to be worth $50 to $100 million in October 2005.[8] In 2009, Cramer received earnings of $461,276 from TheStreet.com.[1]

2014-09-20 19:32:02,"Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL), a mid-cap deep-water oil drilling company, is a very good stock. It has a P/E of 3.32, very low debt, 50% profit margin, lots of expansion planned, and an easily sustainable (due to the high profit margins) 13% dividend. It's a very good stock, and very undervalued- trading at $28 when it's worth at least $40 IMHO.  I've invested a lot into it recently. Vodafone (VOD), a British large/mid-cap telecom company servicing western Europe and parts of India, is a very good and very undervalued stock as well. It has a P/E of 4.84, a dividend of 6.5%, and it's trading at $33 while worth IMHO $45. Hope this helps."
2014-09-20 19:05:53,"I don't think very many Americans know and/or understand any of the facts that you just listed. I mean, I was heavily invested in Yahoo, and read articles and analysis on Yahoo and Alibaba almost daily, and I barely know all the things that you just listed. I mean, I know it, but I don't see that stuff discussed frequently.

I think the answer to your question is, yes. It is all about fees. Fees are exactly what led to the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. Everybody just wanted to collect their fees. From your mortgage broker, to the bank that he sells that mortgage to, all the way up the food chain, everyone just wanted their fees. Everyone was doing it, so why be the ethical one and not take the easy money? That was the attitude."
2014-09-20 16:07:35,Noted.

2014-09-20 01:09:39,China has a great economy. It is predicted that by 2015 it will pass the US economy. Alibaba now has the power to invest in other companies and has showed it can do so successfully. In other words Alibaba is the first company that will showcase Chinas economy. 
2014-09-20 00:50:20,I think $10 is a good price to get in on. I might allocate 60% of the $ amount I want to invest in it at $10 and just wait to invest the other 40% incase it drops below $10.

2014-09-19 16:29:05,da stock split was real
2014-09-19 16:13:50,"They did a stock split. Example you own one apple and the price for that apple is 10. 10 is a lot of money for one apple and less ppl have money to buy the apple because of this. So they decide to split the apple in 10 equal pieces and make it possible for anyone to buy a pice for 1. The guy who owned the apple before the split now has 10pieces that are worth 1 per piece, instead of one apple that is worth 10. It hasn't dropped, they just split the stock so that more ppl could buy in to the company and the price wouldn't be so high."
2014-09-19 16:10:46,"AAPL had a 7-1 split in June. Essentially, anyone who had a share of AAPL worth $700 then had seven shares of AAPL worth $100. Wherever you're looking at is just applying that split retroactively, so that it doesn't look that AAPL tanked in June. So, that $100 share price you're seeing is actually when it was at $700 or so. If you look at other sources, they will show the real prices and the split date."
2014-09-19 16:08:19,"That is because AAPL conducted a stock split.

As far as i'm aware Apple split 7-1 meaning for each share you held before the split you will get 7 after. Therefore dividing the price by 7.

Anyone feel free to correct me if i'm wrong."

2014-09-19 08:31:06,"i dont think you can invest in alibaba w/ anything other than a 3-5 year horizon to start with.  You aren't buying this today and flipping it for a quick 20% next week, you aren't getting in on the intitial shares you are buying on the market at 9:30...so you will miss the initial pop and will have to hope it pulls a go pro if you plan on trading.

That said, I dont use Alibaba and have no familiarity with it - much rather own a basket of chinese internet names thru the ETF than alibaba directly. "
2014-09-19 08:24:10,"What nonsense. Every company around the world is fundamentally a political investment. TSLA is doing well because the Obama administration showered it with money. The solar energy industry exists solely because of government support. The banking institutions exist solely because of political bailout. From the oil industry to even silicon valley, a lot of politics is involved. 

His point of irregularities of accounting and loose governance is more pertinent to the BABA issue, but it's not like the world is immune from such problems as well.

2014-11-04 21:41:03,"&gt; What are some ways of identifying which stock to go after? Are there any particularly useful websites you use that help with this?

With only 1k using questrade you definitely shouldn't be actively trading like other people recommend. Even investing your entire account into one trade will cost you 1% ($5 on the buy, $5 on the sell) so it'll be impossible. Figure out if you want to be growth oriented or value oriented. Growth stocks are more expensive from a valuation perspective and have huge potential but also huge risk. Think of Facebook, Tesla, Netflix. Value stocks are stocks believed to have strong fundamentals and trade at a cheap valuation. These are a lot less exciting and generally lower risk/reward but can be the foundation for a stable long term portfolio. If you genuinely want to get into investing, read http://www.amazon.ca/The-Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing/dp/0060555661 pretty much the bible for investing. Also be weary of technical trading and patterns etc, people often fall into the trap of seeing something in complete randomness.

&gt; Revenue in the three months ended in September rose to $114 million, yielding a net loss of 51 cents.

&gt; Analysts had been modeling $116.2 million and a 55-cent net loss per share.

&gt; CEO Dave DeWalt remarked that the company’s billings “reflected strong demand for FireEye’s advanced security solutions in an environment of escalating targeted attacks.” He added that “billings from new and existing customers were both at record levels as FireEye expanded its installed base and successfully cross-sold multi-vector solutions.”

&gt; For the current quarter, the company sees revenue in a range of $135 million to $147 million, and a net loss of 46 cents to 50 cents. That is below consensus of $143.8 million on the top line, about in line with consensus for a 49-cent loss.

&gt; Billings are expected in a range of $195 million to $210 million.

&gt; FireEye shares are down $6.90,  or 20%, at $27.24, in the late session."

2014-11-04 15:15:40,"Thank you. Side question: I keep getting hung up on the comments like, e.g., facebook offering X% of their shares representing a Y valuation. 

If there are other shares not going to the market, those are being held by individuals within facebook? Possibly hedge funds?"

2014-11-04 15:00:08,"Stock market is just a market for people to exchange shares for money based on bid/ask prices. Being traded on a big market like NYSE or NASDAQ is really more of an affirmation that the company is on the up and up, and is a little less likely to just completely disappear overnight. All stock ownership is ""private"" until you decide to sell on the market. So while SoftBank may own a majority stake (&gt;50%), they have no obligation to make those shares available to anyone via the stock markets. Most companies will retain a &gt;50% ownership when their company is public for the sole reason that they want to retain controlling ownership in all business decisions."
2014-11-04 14:34:00,Yes legally and on paper everything would be course fine. The issue is that it is not clean and definitely an additional risk.
2014-11-04 14:20:27,"Somewhere in a document it says that 100% of the company is represented by X number of shares.  Some of those shares trade on the NYSE, some don't.  For now, the ones held by SoftBank are not trading on the NYSE, but there's no reason I can see why one day SoftBank might wake up and decide they want to trade them there - the same way that your shares of Sprint won't trade on the NYSE until you decide to put in an sell order.

The shares generally represent 100% of the company, *however*, you must remember that bond holders (creditors) have first dibs on the company's assets in the event of a liquidation.  With luck what is left is more than zero, but that is usually not the case."

2014-11-04 09:07:59,"good morning traders! happy midterm election day! here are your tuesday morning stock movers-

&gt; **Alibaba**—In its first report as a public company, Alibaba matched estimates with per-share profit of 45 cents per share. Revenue was above consensus, however, as was its total users figure as well as merchandise volume.

&gt; **Time**—The Sports Illustrated publisher beat estimates by 5 cents with quarterly profit of 41 cents per share, and revenue also exceeded forecasts. However, a drop in print advertising revenue prompted Time to cut its full-year revenue forecast for the second time.

&gt; **Becton Dickinson**—The medical supply products maker earned an adjusted $1.68 per share for its fourth quarter, 3 cents above estimates, with revenue above analyst forecasts. Becton saw strength in emerging markets as well as improved sales in diabetic systems and other products.

&gt; **Dish Network**—The satellite TV provider fell 8 cents shy of Street estimates with third quarter profit of 31 cents per share. Revenue also fell short of projections, with Dish losing 12,000 subscribers.

&gt; **Regeneron**—The drug maker missed estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.52 per share, with revenue also short of estimates. The miss came despite stronger sales of its injectable eye treatment Eyelea.

&gt; **Office Depot**—The office supplies retailer reported third quarter adjusted profit of 10 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates, with revenue also above consensus. It also raised full-year earnings guidance as it continues to benefit from its merger with rival OfficeMax.

&gt; **Discovery Communications**—The TV programmer beat estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 46 cents per share. Revenue was slightly short of estimates, and Discovery also cut its revenue guidance for the full year.

&gt; **Michael Kors**—The luxury goods maker earned $1 per share for its second quarter, 11 cents above estimates, with revenue above forecasts as well. However, the stock is getting hit as some consider its sales guidance disappointing.

&gt; **Priceline Group**—The travel site operator reported an adjusted $22.16 per share for the third quarter compared to estimates of $21.11. Revenue also beat estimates, although Priceline said it will see revenue growth of 24 percent, less than the Street is forecasting. Weakness in Europe is among the factors contributing to the weaker performance.

&gt; **CVS Health**—The company reported quarterly profit of $1.15 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates by 2 cents. Revenue was above estimates as well, although the company's fourth quarter EPS projection fell largely below consensus. Higher costs are weighing on results, and the company is also seeing its abandonment of tobacco sales weighing on revenue.

&gt; **Archer Daniels Midland**—The grain processor reported adjusted third quarter profit of 81 cents per share, beating estimates by 8 cents. Revenue was slightly short, but the company benefited from better profit margins in its processing business.

&gt; **Sprint**—The wireless carrier reported a bigger-than-expected loss for its latest quarter, as well as subscriber losses that exceeded forecasts. Sprint also announced it was cutting 2,000 jobs.

&gt; **AIG**—The insurer beat estimates by 12 cents a share with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.21 per share, with revenue beating estimates as well. AIG was helped by better results at its flagship insurance operations.

&gt; **L Brands**—The retailer raised its earnings guidance for the just-completed third quarter, as it prepares for an analyst meeting next week. The Victoria's Secret parent did not say why it upped the forecast.

&gt; **Herbalife**—Herbalife fell 6 cents short of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.45 per share, with revenue missing as well. The maker of nutritional products also cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast, with sales weakening.

&gt; **Honda**—The automaker is under investigation by NHTSA, which is looking into whether Honda properly reported deaths and injuries related to defective air bags made by Japan's Takata Corp.

&gt; **Marathon Oil**—The oil and natural gas production and exploration company reported adjusted quarterly profit of 76 cents per share, beating estimates of 59 cents. Marathon did see a 24-percent drop in profit from a year earlier.

&gt; **JPMorgan Chase**—The company firm said it is the subject of a criminal probe by the Justice Department related to its dealings in the currency market. JPM said its legal liabilities may be up to $5.9 billion more than its current reserves earmarked for that category.

&gt; **Procter &amp; Gamble**—The company has begun talks with the Argentine government over accusations of tax fraud. The consumer products giant has temporarily suspended operations in that country.

&gt; **Stryker**—The medical products maker has settled a lawsuit related to its hip implant products and said the settlement would likely not hurt its profits.

&gt; **Apple**—Apple is moving ahead with plans to issue bonds in euros, with the sale expected to be completed today. The sale is expected to raise at least one billion euros, equivalent to about $1.2 billion.

2014-11-04 08:57:55,"There is a lot more to trading than commission. No trader is made/ruined by commissions, they're made or ruined by the trades they make. Active traders won't pay the commissions listed on the websites of these brokers. They'll negotiate them down.

the screeners and scanners are for developing ideas during off market hours. During the day the trading software used by the brokers above uses real time level 2 data and direct market access in some cases for making intraday trades. This is a collection of the tools I use, not a list of every single component of them that I use. It would take me writing a book to go into level 2 access, direct routing, ECN fees and rebates, hot keys, real time charting and chart set up and all the intricacies of these tools and what to look for on the sites.

2014-11-03 12:02:03,"baba now well above that $100 mark here ... running up ahead of it's first quarterly earnings report since ipo tomm.

&gt; Several analysts recently initiated coverage of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), ahead of its Q3 earnings due before the open Tuesday, with buy or equivalent ratings.

&gt; Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $2.6 billion and earnings per share minus items of 45 cents for the China e-commerce leader's fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30. RBC Capital Markets, in a research report, expected 49% growth in revenue for Alibaba from the year-earlier quarter and 13% growth in adjusted net income.

&gt; Alibaba stock was up 4% in early trading in the stock market today. Alibaba made the largest-ever U.S. IPO, in terms of money raised, in September, pricing its shares at 68. Alibaba stock touched an all-time high above 100 on Tuesday, when the IBD Leaderboard stock cleared a buy point of 99.80.

&gt; Tuesday will mark the company's first quarterly report since the IPO.

&gt; RBC analyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage on Alibaba on Wednesday with an outperform rating and price target of 120.

&gt;""Alibaba has emerged as the dominant e-commerce platform in China, with a meaningful potential to expand its retail business globally and to expand into other verticals,"" Mahaney wrote in his research note. ""Just as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have become Internet utilities in the U.S., Western Europe and some other markets, Alibaba has become an Internet utility in China.""

&gt; Alibaba's multiple Web platforms handle an estimated 80% of consumer e-commerce in China.

&gt; JPMorgan initiated coverage on Alibaba on Wednesday, with an overweight rating and price target of 112.

&gt; ""Alibaba has profoundly changed Chinese consumers' purchase behavior and is one of the most profitable and fast-growing large-cap Internet companies globally,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst Alex Yao. ""We believe its sustainable growth outlook and impressive profitability on an already large-scale makes it a highly sought-after Internet asset for global investors.""

&gt; Also initiating coverage on Alibaba was Cheng Cheng of Pacific Crest Securities, with an outperform rating and price target of 125.

&gt; ""Alibaba is the premier player in a rapidly growing e-commerce market in China,"" Cheng wrote. ""Despite significant scale already, we still see multiple growth opportunities ahead of Alibaba."""
2014-11-03 11:56:18,"Scottrade will run a credit check when you open your account. Not sure what that means in terms of you being a young person w/o much credit history or if that hurts anything, but I wouldn't think it will. I would think the only negative effect would be Scottrade might say you don't have any credit so you're not able to trade. I would call them and discuss it with them and just be straight up. They should appreciate that you are trying to start young and save for your future and be honest about it. Regarding margin you need a minimum of $2k to trade on margin and I would recommend that you get a margin account if you can because it will be a lot easier to grow a $4k account than a $1k account.

The S&amp;P 500 was almost at its historic all-time high of 1550-ish, and I figured that we were headed for a crash.  So in March I took all my investments, put them into stable value type funds or just cash, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  In September when the S&amp;P was at around 1700, I got back into the market.  

Here we are over 300 points HIGHER than September 2013 and no crash yet.

2014-11-02 18:08:14,"I'm really sorry you feel that way man. I simply made a list of resources and posted them here for people to look at. I am not sharing (and do not share) my trading strategies or advise people on how to use these sites/services...just provide the info so it's there and people can use it if they want or if they find it helpful.

Further this isn't an investment sub. If you want investment advice perhaps /r/investing would be more up your alley. This subreddit is mostly traders and people who want to actively manage their portfolios. 

Further in response to your original comment the only reason I responded is because you're providing bad information. The SEC does not set rules for pattern day trading. FINRA does. FINRA sent the rules to the SEC where they approved them and now they apply to all **US brokers**. Non-US brokers may or may not be affected and it depends on the country the broker exists and conducts business in. Finally it's not the SEC that places a freeze on your account if you do not meet the PDT requirement and continue to day trade; it's the broker itself.

Anyway thanks for your comments. It's good for people to see skepticism and criticism so they can make informed decisions but I wanted to make sure the information they're seeing is accurate. I wish you luck in your trading/investing."

2014-11-02 14:34:20,"Lol yes there is a lot of bullshit out there. I've done this long enough that I like to think I have filtered through a lot of it, but you learn new things all the time. The thing w/ Nate and the SEC is the one argument everyone uses to bash Investors Underground and it's legitimate but at the same time I have seen first hand his chat room, traded with his moderators side by side (in person) and seen their skills and techniques, as well as seen several people I knew before they joined IU and they went from being mediocre/shitty traders to making 10x as much as me in a very short period of time. Some of these people have sketchy backgrounds and some run businesses that make way more for them than their trading activities, but the truth is they didn't get to that point by being shitty traders. You have to start somewhere. In my experience Nate is a great teacher and is very willing to help his students even though he charges for it; he will bend over backwards to help you and so will most of the people who moderate his chat and run his side businesses. Kunal is the same way. The guy invites his students all the time to come to his condo in Florida and trades hand in hand w/ them to help them grow and will do anything for you...if I don't talk to him for a while he calls me and bothers me and sends me texts until I call him and give him an update on how my trading has been and how I'm doing because he wants to make sure that his students and friends are successful just like him (even if they do it selling services, teaching, etc). Keith Kern also I have chatted w/ him on Twitter and he was very willing to meet up with me to share his ideas and style as I was driving around the country meeting different traders and was a super nice dude. Most of these guys even if they are charging or making more from their businesses than from trading are still really good teachers and willing to help a lot, and they're all consistently profitable traders in the long run. Further, I actually know a lot of people who are really shitty traders but are still awesome teachers and have a lot to offer so it's not always 100% based on ""how much money do they make in the market?"" Sometimes people are just better at teaching or have weird shady backgrounds or completely suck at trading but still have a lot to offer. I think you can actually learn just as much from someone who tried trading for a living and failed miserably as you can from someone who was successful. Anyway you're right, there are a lot of great resources here but it's important that people do their own DD and understand that I'm not recommending any of these services, just showing what I have used myself and what has worked for me to get me to the point that I could trade stocks for a living.

Id recommend starting with the one by Pat Dorsey thats called ""The Little Book That Builds Wealth.""  It focuses on taking a qualitative look at companies' competitive advantages.  

Then once youve found a Little Book that clicks with you, you can check out other books by the author or the books from his Recommended Reading section.  

For me, books with Warren Buffett on the cover immediately clicked with my sensibilities.  Theyre all pretty much the same, but gun to my head, Id recommend Warren Buffett Way or Buffettology.  "
2015-04-01 12:05:19,"US stock markets are the most liquid, meaning they have the most buyers and sellers.

This is important because if there was one guy with $1M worth of AAPL shares he needed to sell because he wants to buy a new house, he can sell those shares in an instant and nobody would notice.

In smaller and less liquid stocks, if you had $1M worth of shares and you wanted to sell, there would not be many buyers and you could knock the price of the stock down a lot.

US stocks also have the most analysts and writers writing articles about stocks. If you want to research a stock, there will be a lot of different sources of information.

There are many more advantages, these are just two.

Point remains - the economy is supporting companies growing earnings, which is supporting current valuation levels.  That's all.  'The market' will still bounce around, but the fundamentals are all there."

2015-03-31 19:47:44,"If you had a big pile of money what would you do with it?  The options seem to be 1) put it in a room and lock it up.  The interest is almost as good as option 2) put it in a savings account.  A slightly better option is 3) invest it in bonds.  Solid and secure bonds are only slightly better than the savings account.  Any bond with a return is very high risk.  That leaves the next option 4) real estate.  While partially recovered from the crash, there are still foreclosures going on.  You can buy items on the block for cheap but upkeep and rental is a problem.  That leaves the last option 5) stocks.  Remember, the price of stocks has only a secondary reliance on the actual performance of the stock.  The stock is an entity that is bought and sold on its own and its value is based on how much others want to purchase the stock certificate and that depends on how much free money they have.  Since there are few other options most people will have a combination of 3, 4 and 5 with a bias toward 5 right now.  There are still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines yet in options 1 through 4 and people have watched the stock market go up and up during the last 6 years or so.  Until one of the options 2 to 4 becomes more productive there is little chance that the money will flow from 5 to the other more promising option.  If the huge piles of money that are presently in options 1 to 4 run out, the markets should plateau in a dynamic equilibrium state as long as one the options from 2 to 4 hasn't perked up.  The money has been shifted into a few very large piles over the last 40 years and the owners have very little real use for it except the options mentioned.  They really do not need more than one $3 million dollar yacht, 2 personal jets and 4 mansions."
2015-03-31 19:34:59,"Your supposition is wrong - the job market is actually quite strong, comparatively.  We can argue about methodology, but the 5.5% unemployment rate number is quite good, and even wage growth, which is usually the last thing to budge in an up economy, no longer looks terrible

Fundamentals support the current price level - historically, the market is fully valued, not over-valued, by almost every measure.  It is in no way significantly over-valued.

The 'current bull market' is primarily the result of increased corporate earnings - companies that make money are more valuable than companies that don't.  And as companies make more money, that means they are *worth* more.

I know everyone is freaked out because it's been five whole years since the last depression....but historically, although we are due for a 10% correction or so, we are in no way in 'bubbly' territory."

2015-03-31 18:56:54,"&gt; How else can you be interpreting that?

I'm sorry, but I have to be honest ... cherry picking words out of context to twist what people say does nothing more than show ignorance ... the man did not say ""in the stock market the best strategy is to be inactive"" ... he said ""**at times**, in the stock market the best strategy is to be inactive.""

So, to answer your question, I interpret it exactly the way he said it, and in the context he said it ... as having no mention or anything to do with index funds, and in the context of a Chief Investment Strategist and head of equity research whose job is to, in broad terms, guide clients who invest in individual securities  about when are the most opportune times to either add to or trim holdings, and in the context of a market that has mostly traded sideways for months.

&gt; Do you know what Raymond James does?

I've gotten a fairly good idea of what the firm does from my conversations with the Founder/Chairman, as well as various other board members and executives, including Mr. Saut. Do you know what Raymond James does? Clearly, you don't, so that's a rhetorical question.

I'm glad to hear you think you make more than executives at NYSE-traded financial firms, but could really care less how much you think you make, and would bet my right arm that it's a fraction of what I make as an ""active"" investor, since I happen to know what day traders make ... and what they lose ... sorry, just being honest, since you asked."

2015-03-31 17:22:40,"Yeah, but I don't put automatic trailing command. I adjust it manually. For example, I can put the stop below the swing low. If the position still alive after few days, I might place the stop based on weekly chart. If the position moves up (or down if it's short) I might use ATR. If the stock had a trend that never violated X days moving average, I might use that line as a moving stop.

I must say that in my experience this is **a low probability** setup. Meaning, 8-9 times out of 10 I stopped out at a worse price than if I had just liquidized at target. However, the 1-2 exceptions usually make up for it. The hard part is keep doing that until it pays off."

From Fool.com - What: Shares of data management software specialist Splunk (Nasdaq: SPLK  ) soared 18% today after its quarterly results and guidance impressed Wall Street.

So what: Splunk's second-quarter loss widened, but a big beat on the top line -- revenue surged 71% to $44.5 million versus the consensus of $39.8 million -- coupled with upbeat guidance for the full year eases recent concerns over its exposure to slowing tech spending. In fact, the company added a whopping 400 new customers during the quarter, reigniting plenty of optimism about its growth prospects going forward.

Now what: Management now sees full-year revenue of $183 million-$186 million, up nicely from its prior view of $174 million-$177 million, and expects operating margins to improve as well. ""Overall, we're pleased with our Q2 results, product developments, and increased customer base,"" CFO David Conte said in a conference call. ""We're looking forward to continuing to add the best field reps available and expanding our platform breadth and capabilities."" Given Splunk's still-speculative nature, however, I'd remain cautious about buying into that bullishness."

Is there any fundamental reason for the move? I check the news and I see: ""The Internet radio service said that its second-quarter loss widened. But it said that revenue from mobile devices jumped.""

Ok, so is this revenue from mobile something that could make a big difference?

- However it's more awesome if I don't hit my max loss obviously which I haven't done in over 6 months!

- That kind of stuff sets me off because I know it's an avoidable mistake, but because of that I went into tilt mode and hit my max loss on Wed.

- JUST an idea for now

And these new (higher yielding) bonds will make up part of long term treasuries etfs. So yes the bonds issued 3 years ago will be devalued, but the bonds issues following the rates rise will add value to the etf. Add that stockholders will be exchanging for bonds 10yrs and 20yrs, i still dont see bonds going down.

As for ""flops"" yes that will happen. But they're in the business of hiring talented people and not meddling with the creative vision. This is usually a process that yields great results. The reason for most bad TV is there are simply ""too many cooks"" and too many recycled ideas on Network.

With Netflix's growing subscriber base, the shift in how we consume media and the opportunities in China and beyond, I'm LONG."

2015-05-15 21:23:24,I actually sold the rest of my trade flat today. I sold 1/3 of it at $3.99 from my $3.86 entry yesterday but I guess it wasn't ready to follow through. I prob just got shaken out in that morning dump today though...so I may rebuy. I still think this goes to $5+ once it breaks $4 and actually holds. The whole market is just very shaky right now so these kinds of breakouts seem to take some kind of news or a catalyst or something to get them moving. But it's still on my list for a rebuy. Doesn't matter if I have to buy and sell it 5 or 10 times and make a dime each time...it's still a 50 cent gain or a buck gain by the time I'm done...just costs me more commission which isn't really an issue for me as a day trader...just part of the game.

Barclays Says FXCM 'Upside Limited'

&gt; Barclays analysts said that FXCM Inc (NYSE: FXCM) is ""moving through a tough period, but upside limited"" in a new note following the company's Q1 earnings. The continued overhang of the SNB's January decision and tough terms of a Leucadia National Corp. (NYSE: LUK) bailout created a scenario that makes it very tough for FXCM to derive profit from, according to the research note. That is why Barclays reaffirmed its $1 price target, a level it says reflects the ""implied sale price of the company given the payout with Leucadia.""

2015-10-06 13:44:33,"I agree, it's good to have a rational discussion on how people view stocks.  And the thing is, since the stock market is a zero-sum game, people need to have other people disagree with them.  So no worries about me ever getting defensive, I will never get defensive and I fully understand that all stock market picking is trying to see the future, which no one can do (without insider knowledge).

In my case, if I think a stock is worth $20, and then it's on sale for $15, I will definitely buy it.  But if it drops to $10, then I will need to reevaluate why I thought it was worth $15, because obviously I was wrong, and it's actually only worth $10.  If I want to keep buying, then I need to understand where I went wrong.

And one thing I've learned is that I need to admit when I'm wrong.  I thought the stock was worth $20, but it's actually at $10.  It means I was wrong and I have to admit it, sell the stock, and move onto a stock that I can better understand.  That's my opinion.

My hypothesis isn't that VW will go to zero, I instead believe that the stock will get pounded even worse than right now.  But there are plenty of scenarios that can bring the equity to zero, but the brand and the car still exists.  Namely if they run out of money, if they break some of the covenants on their bonds based on certain levels of cash, etc.  The same thing happened with GM and Chrysler and the car companies still exist but a lot of people lost billions of dollars.  I don't necessarily think this is what will happen, but it's definitely on the table based on the magnitude of this fraud.  

But I could be completely wrong, so it will be interesting to watch this play out."

2015-10-06 00:47:25,You bought this in an AMerican exchange even thoguh this is OTC?
2015-10-06 00:27:32,"Thanks for your input, I appreciate it. I do enjoy the fact that we disagree on this. In fact, my play is fundamentally the opposite of your opinion: I believe that VW won't ""go to 0"" long-term (for reasons I won't get into unless you want me to get into them, for fear of coming off as argumentative). It appears that you think the opposite is not only possible, but somewhat likely.

However, more to your questions about ""exit strategy"": I do not have any clue as to how stocks will ""behave"". I do firmly believe that given enough time, market prices will reflect intrinsic value in a company, but as to what might happen to a stock price tomorrow or next month I have no idea and don't pretend to know. 

But you said that if your GOOGL position ""breaks 600"" you're going to sell ""because it means you were wrong"". I take a different approach. I am more likely to buy when a stock is cheaper, and more likely to sell when it's higher. It seems obvious when I type it, but it does ""feel"" backwards in practice. Most of us novices fall in love with our winners (I know I do) and selling them when they're up feels like we're selling our pet retriever for a dollar. And when our positions fall, we feel like all we can do is look for exit signs as soon as possible. But again, buying low and selling high is the name of the game.

Put it one last way: I see VW as a $20 being offered for $15 right now. I know I won't get access to the full $20 for some time, probably a year and half or more. Would you buy that? Probably not, because you don't think that $20 bill is real. But if you thought it was genuine, and in 6 months the same person offered to sell you another $20 for $12, would you buy again? I'm saying I'm buying VW now and I'll buy it if it's cheaper in 6 months as well.

VW isn't going to go to $0. This is a very costly, very serious mistake. But VW will recover and continue making cars. I'll eat the front page of a GOOGL Quarterly Report if it goes to $5 by 2020."
2015-10-06 00:21:21,"I disagree, but it doesn't mean I know anything more than you.  It takes two sides to make a market.

That being said, I believe there is a lot more to fall.  As I've said above, I think we are nowhere close to the end, and there's a lot of pain coming in the form of more revelations of wrong doing and lost sales, etc for years to come.

There's a striking difference between VW and BP.  BP was essentially an accident.  Sure, negligence could have played a role, but VW was pure fraud.  And the global scope is unprecedented.  I don't believe that the bottom of this scandal will arrive only a couple of weeks after it was discovered, I think this plays out long term and will only bode poorly for VW.

I know you said you're ready to buy and hold for the long term, but this is something that I believe is a bad strategy.  Buy and hope is usually a losing strategy and a lot of lost opportunity.  For example, you could put that money in AAPL and probably have a better overall return.  And as a long term play, I think VW could be a badly damaged brand, and there are plenty of opportunities for it to go bankrupt in the next few years, depending on how badly the sales are hit.  Sales don't have to go to zero for it to go bankrupt, it just has to go down.  Bondholders could make a power-move and try to wipe out shareholder equity if there's even a hint of cashflow problems.

There are just too many scenarios where VW goes to 0, especially in the long term.  I think there's probably a short term play in a couple of months, when all the fraud bad news it out of the stock, just like BP, but I think the stock will falter at best and never reach the highs of the last several years for a long, long time.  During this time, you could have better spent the money on other stocks.

This is why I was asking about an exit strategy.  In my head, I always have a speculation over how I believe the stock is going to behave.  It might be really vague, but for example, I bought GOOGL when it dropped to below 600.  My thesis was that I don't believe it will ever revisit 600 again.  So far, I've been right, but if I'm wrong, ie. it breaks 600, then I'm going to sell because it means I was wrong.  That's why I was curious what your strategy is.  When you say you'll hold for the long term, that worries me because it means that under no circumstances will you admit that you're wrong and you will hold on for a long time.

Of course, you could be absolutely right, and it recovers significantly over the next few years.  Which is why I say good luck to you."
2015-10-06 00:03:24,"What specifically do you disagree with? I'd welcome some constructive criticism.
If the stock continues dropping through 2016, I will continue adding shares, until the end of Q2. At that point, my plan is to hold the shares permanently, or until my sell target is reached. Volkswagen is a great company. A fraction of it's senior management made a grave (and very expensive) mistake that affects a fraction of it's business. But it still makes great cars and will continue to do so in the future (or so I think)."
2015-10-05 23:29:44,"&gt;How much more do you think it will go down from this point?

2015-10-05 23:13:30,"You would wait until the share price was more before you would buy?

No, what you mean to say is that you don't think it has hit its floor yet. How much more do you think it will go down from this point? 

"
2015-10-05 23:05:33,"I disagree with your view on this, but I very much respect your depth of analysis, so good luck to you.

Do you have an exit strategy in case you are wrong?  For example, what if it keeps dropping every month through 2016?  I don't necessarily think this will happen, but I'm curious what your strategy is if you're wrong in terms of your outlook through 2016."
2015-10-05 23:00:51,"I don't believe it is, I believe there is still a huge amount of pain left.  But our disagreement is what makes a market."
2015-10-05 22:59:53,"The difference between BP and VW is that the worst case scenario was basically known soon after the oil spill.  They knew exactly what the problem was, how much oil was lost, what the maximum fine could be, etc.  There was a known worst case scenario.  There wasn't going to be more oil rigs that spilled more oil.  And they did a really good job going down into the Gulf and just dropping hunks of money everywhere, and heading off a lot of the lawsuits early on.

With VW, this is a conspiracy to hide things, so they don't know the full scope of the problem yet.  11M vehicles having this problem globally is a huge problem.  And they don't even know if this is the full extent of the issue.  Are there other problems with the cars that they were covering up?  Even if it costs $1000/vehicle to fix, that's $11B just for the fix.  Then there are fines on top of this.  And then there are class action lawsuits that VW will need to settle, because there is no way they can win.

This sounds like just bad news after bad news for months to come.  And then, if market share gets hurt because people think that VW and Audi are scumbags, then it will get even worse.  Car companies can easily go bankrupt, like GM, Chrysler, Saab, etc, and all the stock holder equity can get wiped out.

There's a time to buy VW as a value play, but now is not the time.  It's way too early.  There is no good news that will come in the horizon so basically it's better to wait for the kitchen sink moment where they give out all the bad news in a single news conference, the stock collapses, investors capitulate and then you jump in.  Right now it's just people trying to catch falling knives, and there's going to be a lot more pain ahead."
2015-10-05 22:49:17,This is already fully expected though and probably priced in. 
2015-10-05 22:28:08,There is still plenty of bad news coming for VW. I dont think its done dropping. 
2015-10-05 22:24:52,"TLDR: This is a value play. I bought VLKAF @ $119.37 / share with a target price of between $143.32 and $182.49 by the end of FY16'. 

My process began where you did: I think that the investment community is shocked and horrified that a company as large as Volkswagen could knowingly lie to it's investors for so long (go back and read some of the annual reports, specifically the sections on emissions, they're pretty damning in hindsight).

However, pissing off Mutual Fund managers and hedge fund types who collectively feel they control the world, and not being able to make and sell passenger vehicles are two different things. VW still makes great cars. Moreover, I frankly just don't think that very many consumers give a shit about what levels of emissions their cars put out, as long as they're safe, fun to drive, and get good fuel economy. 

I think the place that this crisis will affect VW is in it's future expected revenue, and on it's balance sheet. I don't think this will affect profit margins, once you strip the incoming hits to the balance sheet out of the numbers.

Starting with the balance sheet, pick a big number that may account for the fines, and the lawsuits. They've set aside something like $8Bil right now. I don't see the EPA fining VW into oblivion because even though they blatantly lied and cheated, this snafu didn't have the same environmental apocalypse-type effect that the BP spill did, for example. Here's my opinion on this: as long as VW's balance sheet can handle this kind of an event (it can), than this short-term hit to it's cash isn't actually that important to it's ability to turn out revenues year after year.

As for their revenues, I did some math (I assumed that VW doesn't sell another diesel car in the US until 2017, that they sell 12-25% fewer passenger vehicles in North America as a result of their brand taking a beating, and that they sell 5-10% fewer passenger vehicles worldwide as well). I expect them to lose between $12Bil and $24Bil in 2016 because of this mess. I had their expected 2016 revenues at $215Bil, so that puts my estimation for 2016 revenue at  between $194Bil and $206Bil, roughly.

I used a crude way of turning those revenue numbers into projected value, I used Price to Sales ratio. Average PS Ratio for VW has been .42, it's PS ratio the week before this news broke was .35. Right now it's at .23, a reflection of the vitriol that large investors have for VW right now. I expect that ratio to recover over time as this news slips into the past and more Quarterly announcements come and go. 

I took my long position at the end of last week, but I do expect the price to go down quite a bit more before it goes back up. I'm prepared to DCA my position up until midway through 2016."

2015-10-05 18:40:48,"They are exposed to the possibility massive legal action. That risk is probably already priced - in. But do you think this is the end of the road?

If you took the value of every one of those cars from the years in question, and doubled the value of those sales (50% in fines, 50% in consumer lawsuits) you would probably get close to the immediate effect on market cap.

But you're not done there. You need to look at forward revenue for that line of vehicles and subtract it from future revenue.

And that's not it either, you need to take the R&amp;D for redeveloping the engine to meet specifications, and add it to future costs. 

If you did all of those things, you would probably be at an appropriate valuation. Compare it to market cap and see if you still like the P/E.

I'm guessing that p/E will be undefined due to negative earnings for the next 1-3 years as a result of this.

2015-10-05 17:43:31,BP did seem like a screaming buy post Macondo (and fears of the company's demise were wildly overdone) but dealing with the spill was an overhang and a distraction for years.

2015-11-20 08:22:22,"good morning traders and happy friday! here are the stocks on the move on this friday morning...

&gt; **Foot Locker** — Foot Locker came in 5 cents above forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of $1 per share. Revenue was also above estimates, and a same-store sales increase of 8.7 percent was well above analysts' estimates of a 6.2 percent increase for the athletic apparel and footwear retailer.

&gt; **Abercrombie &amp; Fitch** — The apparel retailer earned an adjusted 37 cents per share for its latest quarter, well above estimates of 22 cents. Revenue also beat estimates, and although Abercrombie's same-store sales fell 1 percent during the quarter, that was smaller than the 2.3 percent drop anticipated by analysts. Abercrombie benefited from fewer discounts, although it said it expected heavy promotional activity in the industry during the holiday shopping season.

&gt; **Nike** — The athletic apparel and footwear maker increased its dividend by 14 percent, declared a two-for-one stock split, and announced a $12 billion stock buyback program.

&gt; **Alphabet** — Alphabet's Google unit hired VMWare co-founder Diane Green to run its cloud operations. Green has been on the company's board of directors for the past three years, and will remain a director.

&gt; **Gap** — The apparel retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 63 cents per share, matching estimates. The company had pre-released its below-forecast revenue on November 9, noting the impact of a strong dollar. Gap is seeing weak sales at its Banana Republic and Gap clothing stores, but CEO Arthur Peck said he is expecting a significant improvement during 2016's first quarter.

&gt; **International Business Machines** — JMP Securities began coverage on IBM with an ""outperform"" rating, acknowledging that IBM is in the middle of a multiyear transformation but saying that sentiment has swung too far to the negative side.

&gt; **Intel** — Intel was upgraded to ""market outperform"" from ""market perform"" at JMP Securities, following the chipmaker's investor day yesterday. JMP cites strengthening prospects for Intel in the cloud segment, among other factors.

&gt; **Hibbett Sports** — The sporting goods retailer earned 79 cents per share for its latest quarter, 11 cents above estimates, though revenue and its same-store sales increase were below Street estimates. The company said sales softened late in the quarter in its cold weather categories, but it's increased its full-year earnings outlook as cost controls take hold and on expected upbeat sales results for the holiday season.

&gt; **Dollar General** — The discount retailer was upgraded to ""buy"" from ""hold"" at BB&amp;T, saying the company is in position to gain market share following the acquisition of Family Dollar.

&gt; **Workday** — The provider of human resources software reported a wider than expected loss for its latest quarter and gave a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter. Workday is in the process of investing in expansion both geographically and in its software offerings.

&gt; **Williams-Sonoma** — Williams-Sonoma earned 77 cents per share for its latest quarter, 5 cents above estimates, with the housewares retailer also reporting revenue that was very slightly above Street forecasts. However, its current quarter outlook is below analyst estimates, as Williams-Sonoma battles strong competitors like Restoration Hardware and Crate &amp; Barrel.

&gt; **Noble Energy** — The energy producer has postponed the planned initial public offering of its midstream unit, because of unfavorable market conditions.

&gt; **Fresh Market** — Fresh Market beat estimates by a penny with adjusted quarterly profit of 23 cents per share. The specialty grocer saw revenue below forecasts, however, and a drop in comparable store sales. Fresh Market is in the process of considering various options, including a possible sale.

&gt; **Nimble Storage** — Nimble lost 11 cents per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents wider than anticipated, with revenue also below estimates. The provider of data storage technology also gave weak current quarter guidance for both earnings and revenue, with a shifting emphasis to the enterprise market not proceeding as well as the company had initially expected.

&gt; **Ross Stores** — Ross Stores came in three cents above estimates with quarterly profit of 53 cents per share, with revenue very slightly above forecasts and comparable store sales rising three percent. The discount retailer sees current quarter profit slightly below estimates, because of a highly promotional holiday season.

&gt; **Splunk** — Splunk beat forecasts by four cents with adjusted quarterly profit of five cents per share, and the data software company also saw revenue come in well above analyst estimates. Splunk also raised its full-year forecast as its cybersecurity business continues to gain traction.

&gt; **Intuit** — The maker of Quicken and TurboTax reported adjusted quarterly profit of 9 cents per share, compared to analyst estimates of a 4 cents per share loss. Revenue beat forecasts by a wide margin, and the provider of financial software also gave strong current quarter guidance as it continued to gain subscribers.

&gt; **Horizon Pharma** — Horizon withdrew its $1 billion offer for Depomed, after a California court blocked its bid on the basis of improper use of confidential information. Horizon had been pursuing Depomed for the past six months."

2015-11-20 04:16:14,"Back to swing trading, given the required knowledge, there are some ways to counter risks: using options instead or/and along cash positions, using diversification, avoiding some very volatile industries (like biotech) or/and some other clever risk management strategies. Relying on large scale trends and using popular technical analysis strategies (buy at ""support"" and sell at ""resistance"") are not among them. Following crowd behavior and limiting yourself to crowd knowledge don't give you any protection because the crowd is the worst trader/investor. You simply need to learn more about this trading business (risk management, psychology, market analysis, instruments) to enhance your edge and subsequently deploy ""safer"" trading techniques."
2015-11-20 04:02:20,"Swing trading per se is not much safer than day trading simply because of the overnight unexpected gap risk. Especially when using individual stocks and cash positions only, every now and then some unexpected news may cause the price to open way beyond your stop loss price causing you a significant loss. Of course, this can also happen during the trading day but assuming you are in front of your platform you can close the position as soon as it reaches your stop loss area. To make things even trickier you may still get caught in an intraday trading halt even if you are in front of your open trading platform"

2015-11-19 22:18:35,"I think this question is can be answered this question: 1) Do you have the time to day trade? If you hold a regular job I suggest you swing trade because day trading is taxing. Its difficult to say which is harder or more profitable because you will find practitioners/gurus/aces on both sides so its really down to you. 

But my 2 cents is that if you are not someone who likes to make impulse decisions and need some time to think and have less appetite for risk, go for swing. "

Being a successful swing trader right out of the gate, is out of the question. You are really best off only trading money you can afford to lose, at the beginning.

2015-11-19 18:05:05,"As a whole, the stock market always goes up over time.

But if you limit yourself to just one company, it becomes much more of a crapshoot. Let's check out the difference - in the past 10 years - between investing $1,000 in Apple versus Avon (recently kicked out of the S&amp;P 500):

Apple - http://stockchoker.com/?s=AAPL&amp;d=20051119&amp;a=1000
(You'd be up $13,831).

Avon - http://stockchoker.com/?s=AVP&amp;d=20051119&amp;a=1000 
(You'd be down $862).

If you're not a gambler, but like large-cap stocks, you'd probably be best off investing in something like Vanguard's Large-cap EFT - http://stockchoker.com/?s=VV&amp;d=20051119&amp;a=1000

In this case, you'd be up $1,096 with an annual return of 7.68 percent over the last decade. That's not bad, considering the financial crisis and Great Recession were mixed in. You'd have a far greater annual return if you started investing in 2009."
2015-11-19 18:03:17,There's always a learning curve and people don't like losing money so it's still probably really low like less than 20%.

2015-11-19 12:56:56,Adderall doesn't increase intelligence. It increases mental focus of your existing intelligence. If your having trouble staring at charts and doing due diligence on a company or sector then yah it might help. But if you think it will make you see things differently or have better intuition than you already do it won't. I suggest watching Familyguy season 14 ep 2 where brian uses adderall to get perfect example of this.

Its hard to envision renewed strength in commodities until either: The US Dollar sells off; Emerging market demand increases; Or, supply is significantly cut. The expectations of higher US interest rates in the near future plus a significant weakening of other major currencies (Euro, Yen, Yuan, etc.) have had a negative impact impact on nearly all US fixed income sectors. That trend is more likely to accelerate that to reverse in the near term.

I have taken this time to find reits with more land - liabilities value than market value and kinda look at it as getting land for 40-70 cents on the dollar. And a bonus (dividend) for owning it
2015-11-18 15:48:10,"Let me try to give you an example why...

Say you own 1 share of mom-and-pop's pizza shop. In total there are 10 shares outstanding. (You own 10% of the company). mom-and-pop's pizza shop has one location, and is making lots of money, but they decide not to issue a dividend (return their profits to you), and instead take the money they earn and use it to expand. They use the earned money to buy real estate and open up 9 more locations. They then become even more profitable, and re-invest to eventually open up 990 more locations. Now mom and pop pizza shop is as big as pizza-hut, owning 1000 different pieces of real estate... pizza equipment etc. Owning 1 share is the same as owning 10% of this company (and equivalent to owning 100 real-estate locations). 

You're saying... why would I ever want to own 1 share of that company if they're never going to issue a dividend? -- but in my example, I showed you how earning 1 share can eventually gain you a very valuable asset. It works the same way when we're talking about 1 share of a company with 100,000,000 shares outstanding, but on a much different scale. 

Yes to ""realize"" that value you must eventually sell, since you won't receive the value in the form of a dividend, but it doesn't mean that there isn't value being created. Not issuing a dividend now also doesn't preclude them from doing it in the future. At some point in the example, after opening 1000 locations -- they may decide they're done expanding, and instead choose to return future earnings to you in the form of a dividend. "

2015-11-18 12:41:24,I think this was more of a philosophical question. What value is stock if dividends are never issued. 
2015-11-18 11:11:38,"How much do you know about fundamentals?
 
The stock of a firm can rise if the firm generates a profit. If you own stock in that firm, you receive a share of the profits either in the form of dividends, if the firm issues them, or in the right to sell the stock for a higher price than you bought it for thanks to market volatility.
 
This is why earnings announcements and multiples are so important in DD.
 
And before someone jumps in and starts talking about how ""well technically yadda yadda yadda,"" yes, hypothetically a firm doesn't have to generate a profit to issue a dividend, but based solely on fundamentals that's a frequent reason."

2015-08-20 23:07:47,"TL;DR anything you can spare EVERY month is better than a lump sum up front for a given time period (within reason), or even a lump sum every year

advice will be highly dependent on your goals, but lets pretend for the sake of argument that you have a common goal of growing your investment for the purpose of retirement, i.e. eventually having enough passive income that you don't have to work in order to survive...

what to do with your money depends on your taste for risk. generally good bet is http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio

recommended amount of money: no such thing, as much as you can spare every month

some of the things that make the biggest difference are A) putting some money in each month, even if it's a small amount and B) time

lets take some examples:

Exhibit A) put $10,000 in right now, then invest $100 per month for the next 20 years. the total stock market has done about 10% per year since 1999, so if you use an even more modest figure of 8% (a more conservative number would probably be 6% but the basic premise is the same) then at then end of 20 years you'll have:

$100,323.93

Exhibit B) put in $1,000 right now, then invest $500 per month for the next 20 years, at 8% return, you'll have:

$273, 232.75

that's more than double just by investing a decent sum monthly and with 10x less up front

Exhibit C) put in $1,000 right now, then invest $500 per month for 25 years (same as last time but for an extra 5 years), at 8% return you'll have

$439,484.11

that's basically double just by investing for another 5 years

now, with this last number, if you take half of your profits, which is 4% and live off that and invest the other 4% you'll be making about:

$17,579 per year

of course, don't be fooled, because 25 years from now, $17k will only be worth maybe $9k (or less) in today's dollars, so if you think you can manage to get by on $9k a year right now, you'll be fine

hope this sheds some light on the issue

2015-08-20 17:56:43,"The disadvantage is if someone puts in an order for a round number like 10, 15, 20, etc they will buy only a portion of yours and it's possible your other stock won't sell until someone else puts in a buy request, thus busting up and you having two sales. You won't see two sales, but one might sell at $120.01 and the other part at $120.00.

For stocks with lots of volume this wouldn't be an issue, but for less volume stocks it could be, but it's still unlikely."

2015-08-20 16:33:49,"You're getting a lot of upvotes, but you're not telling the whole story. Yes the ""uptick rule"" was eliminated in 2007, but essentially it has been brought back when a ""short sale restriction"" is in effect. 

Currently when a stock drops by 10% or more in a single day, it enters a ""short sale restriction"" mode. You can still short these stocks, but you may not hit the bid when attempting to enter a short position, you must trade on an ""uptick""."
2015-08-20 15:59:19,"Exactly. The article says:

&gt; Therefore, the cost per share to purchase 60 shares of a stock would be higher than the cost to purchase 100 shares, after commission fees are added in to the transaction.

That means buying 113 or 127 shares is more cost efficient than buying 100 shares. Well, of course, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with buying in round numbers."

Tom McCellan was one of those type articles.


There were also many other negative divergences that appear to be dissipating now.

Monetary policy is very important because its a money system built on debt [the FED holds a huge amount of treasury bonds, which are moved around in monetary policy, effecting Bank Reserves and lending.]

The notion that everyone will have them in their houses just like computers in the next 10 years seems pretty unrealistic to me considering where they are at now."
2015-08-19 23:10:50,"&gt; All of this rests on the assumption that relationships between factors and rates of return – if they exist – are persistent. That is, that they persist from one time period to another. This assumption is warranted in almost all scientific fields. If a result of a combination of physical forces is convincingly discovered in experiments, it will work in the future too. If a vaccine is developed that prevents a disease for test subjects, it will work even if everybody uses it.
&gt; These assumptions are completely unwarranted in the investment field. If an investment strategy that beats the market is discovered and verified – even if it is not a spurious discovery – it will not work for everybody. It cannot; it is tautologically obvious that not everybody can beat the market. Hence, a strategy that is identified as effective, correctly or not, must, at some point, if it becomes popular and widely adopted, stop working and may even reverse to become a bad strategy.


Predictive relationships are nearly impossible to find and even when found, don't persist. I'm much more a fan of finding concurrent relationships. This way you can express a macro view. For example, a lot of people are worried that interest rates are going to rise later this year, but how do you best express that view? "

2012-05-10 10:24:20,I think that's a long term short.  I don't see EVs playing out the way people think.  Thats just my opinion though.

2016-02-23 06:04:10,"Depends on what you want to do with your 10k, long term or short term. I would say split the 10K into 2 parts. 5K for index fund that tracks the US economy(sp 500 or dow). You can also pick index fund that tracks certain sectors of the market, just do not pick etf that track a commodity or are leveraged. With the remaining 5K, you can invest in individual companies that you think have potential. Try to pick large cap companies that are stable and have a low beta, to reduce the risk. Pick different companies from different sectors to diversify your account. Or if you you want to get into more active trading, then split your portfolio into thirds. One part index/etf for long term. One part for long term growth of individual stocks. One part for companies that you have to actively trade or extra money to purchase stocks you like down the road. "
2016-02-23 04:44:17,Buy SPY if you want a passive investment.  Why bother picking different stocks and sectors when you have no idea what your doing?

Just a heads-up, since--out of everything you wrote--this is *the most important thing*: you really need to drill into new/unsuccessful day/short-term traders ***why*** you trade volatility...you need to repeat it over and over and over again.

He talked straight up trading, which I liked.

2016-02-22 23:14:38,"If your trade is SPXL, a long entry always is best at a support line (green ones on my chart), wait and buy the bounces and stop near your entry below the line.

Thanks for taking the time to put this together and I'm looking forward to being a daily reader!"
2016-02-22 21:08:17,"Chasing from here has inherent risk since you are near the end, and the better trade imo is to be looking for shorts near the top, and literally stopping out around there on the small chance of a rally beyond. Cash now seems like the more risk-less trade to make and planning a well executed short on the bear market seems to be a better trade. So being patient might be your best bet.

This uptrend might be over very soon, so if you are jumping in tomorrow on the dip, as long as you ride the support lines you should be ok, but wait for clear dips to buy on, and be ready to stop out the instant the support line is lost. You are talking a day trade right? I'm really only confident of one more up day and then my confidence of green day goes down to 30% on day two from here ;) Never buy at any high in the middle of a trend, high risk does not match the smaller reward."

2016-02-22 20:34:10,"I just think that banking in general is getting a bad rap because we are showing very strong signs of a bear market forming as is evident in the last two months of trading. And when it comes to a market correction, it's often banks that go first or get hit hard the soonest, because the whole fundamental concept of the market being bad right now is all related to money and the banks willingness to lend it, and the credit worthiness of those they are lending to.

Also many of these banks are HEAVILY invested into energy. They are the ones who loaned out money for shale drillers in the first place, which is pretty much the catalyst for this crash (well...oil prices falling at the core of that) and now since almost all drillers just got downgrades two weeks ago from S&amp;P-basically showing that their credit is deteriorating. So because of that there is now more risk of default and therefore that is certainly being traded into the price of some bank stocks. I'd look at their portfolio if you can, and if it's energy heavy that might be your answer."

Multiple perspectives is a bad thing it leads to information overload and lack of confidence to pull the trigger. It's a balance. If your friend has a solid track record, I don't see how it would hurt to talk to each other about opportunities and failures. I would leave $figures out of the conversation. % figures work well.

2016-02-22 08:00:57,"It is obviously understandable that you envy your friend because he made more money than you and is technically more successful than you so of course you are jealous. That being said, if you both continue to invest and he never does due diligence but you do it for every company, eventually you are going to make more money than he does. In the long run, your due diligence should decrease the risk of investing and so you will become more profitable than your buddy who is essentially gambling. There is a highly possible scenario where both of you will still lose money though so make sure that you invest intelligently. "
2016-02-22 07:41:23,"Oh my.  Why not just throw darts as you'll have pretty much the same chance of reaching your goals throwing blindfolded than valuing anything that any paid analyst says.   Honesty look at their track records - terrible.  You are obviously a bright studious person who's been caught up and blinded by mainstream financial dogma - why not put your effort towards something else where reaching your goals is attainable and based solely the decisions you make rather than BS from paid want a be analysts?  Learn option strategies, selling premium specifically and you'll see what I'm referring to.  Throw the quarterly reports away, turn off the news and learn simple math - then at least you'll have a higher probability of reaching your goals.  "

2016-02-21 22:26:42,"Canadian here. How much capital do you plan on investing to make that 50k? The stocks you mentions arent exactly known as growth stocks, so even in a big juicy bull market, youd need a ton of capital to reach your goal. These companies are steady dividend stocks which yield in the 4% range. ENB, TD, and CNR are all blue chip long term stocks.

Unless youre tossing nearly a million into the market, it will be tough to come out with 50k profit in a year. "
2016-02-21 21:36:49,This sounds like an awesome idea - looking forward to it!

I'm the newest mod over here, and I hope to be able to help you out with this question of yours. I just started one actually and it's Sundays from 6:00-7:00 EST. Tonight we just had the trial run and the real show will launch 2/28/2016. The link for our main channel we just started is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-uZt8l6LaZUKuuEz6VF6w) please feel free to subscribe!

Our trial run video, just talking market and how to actually day trade can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLtpaS_Uuo&amp;feature=youtu.be). It was mostly just us talking for a few hours to test out the platform we are using. We will have a more scripted format as we progress with it with things like interviews, AMA's, helping you guys with your trades 1 on 1, and of course me personally streaming my live trading at some point as well. 

So hope to get to know most of you and happy trading!

It is also true that people that are rich/wealthy always have cash available and the means to take advantage at times of maximum financial opportunity. 
2016-04-14 20:01:51,"I got laid off last recession and that was the first year I was day trading full time. And it's scary if that's all you do--there's a psychological barrier you have to get over which is ""I need to make x this month to pay my bills."" Because then that can force you to be riskier to meet your targets. I have a few other sources of income besides just trading, which makes that part easier for me"

Example: Borrow 1 share, sell it today for $100. Tomorrow buy 1 share for $90, and give it back. Keep $10. (If the price had increased you would lose money instead of make money). This position effectively bets that the underlying price will decrease."

2016-05-29 11:54:59,Great informative video.
2016-05-29 11:32:44,I use TD Ameritrade and Schwab as that was what my parents set up for me. Schwab is okay but I really like TD Ameritrade for no good reason other than the layout is so easy to use and intuitive. The green looks really good. Probably all of the platforms are about the same in terms of cost besides the free robinhood but that sounds like it has some technical problems.

2016-05-28 10:50:58,"I use Robinhood and love it. Since there are no commissions I can buy small numbers of cheap shares a little at a time. For example over the past year I've been slowly buying up a few shares at a time of AG. For a majority of the year that stock was priced under $7 a share. Sometimes I was only buying 2-4 shares at a time  whenever I had some extra spending cash. I've probably made over 30 purchase orders. Currently I own over 250 shares and had I been paying $7 per trade Scottrade commissions I would have spent over $200 in fees. Now if I want to slowly exit from my position trickling away a few shares at a time now that it seems to have peaked, I can without getting dinged per trade. "

2016-05-27 14:00:55,$DRAD is just seeing its 200MA coming up to is price but also the price dropping below it's 50MA. Zooming out to the weekly view and the averages this stock has on average been rising for along time but it is volatile. The Stockcharts Point and View chart says Bullish 8.5. On the Financials using Gurufocus we see very good Net Margin at 41.6% but low growth at +5.6% P/E stands at 3 which means the shares are undervalued by about 5 times as 15 is considered normal. The Peter Lynch numbers are 24.6 which is way above stock price. This is Small Cap so it seems you have picked a stock with potential but risky because of the size. If it had growth or MA on the horizon I think the stock price would take off. You will need to check the spread before you buy currently at 2% which is painful.
2016-05-27 13:51:09,&lt;copy&gt;... replace a few words &lt;paste&gt; 
2016-05-27 13:41:17,$AVHI has just poked its head up over the 200MA at 12.18. However when I take a view on Stock Charts http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/gallery.html?s=AVHI I see the weekly chart on a downward or flat trend for the last two years. The Point &amp; Figure view says Bearish 7.5 objective. Financials using Gurufocus shows a net margin of only3.04% although revenue growth over 3Y is +39.8% It's Cash to Debt is very low at 0.05 so possibly vulnerable to increases in interest rates.EPS now and predicted are good at the stock price are good at $1.08 The last Peter Lync cost is 11.8 and has remained at this level for more than 5 years. So an unexciting stock that seems quite solid. If I  was going to buy I would need to see the price drop or to have some metric like growth in new home builds before risking my money in a falling stock

2016-05-26 18:58:08,"&gt;  low budget traders may choose to start with penny stocks

I really wouldn't take this as a market standard. Penny stocks are a financial instrument that corporations/accountants use to get public in the shortest period of time and not something that you should trade on. Penny stocks are a good way to gamble or scam people. I might be wrong with this but my experience has proved me otherwise. Penny stocks are like retail forex. Its just not meant for the retail market. Yes, one may argue that not everyone can trade with a billion dollar portfolio. But, I believe retailers should not even think about forex and penny stocks. There are much better avenues in the market that you can look. If you really want to start small, look into the Asian markets (Leave China &amp; HK alone, grossly overvalued to the brim).

Worse, look into etf's. Trade them or even commodities. You atleast will have things under your relative control than with an instrument like forex or pink sheets. 

Give it a try, If you are indeed successful in making millions as Sykes portrays, PM me for a job. I will always have an opening for someone who was able to make millions out of pink sheets. I will set you up with a fund and let you trade the global's. Because, if you can make millions of penny stocks, you can literally shit gold in the global markets. "

"
2016-01-08 18:25:33,"Yes, 6% is not exactly like 'near stall speed'.

From my basic econ 101, what's needed is stall speed + shocks to the system.


Meanwhile for many countries in the EU, this 'stall speed' has been rather close since 2009 / 2010. Then there was the austerity, huge welfare cuts, now migrant crisis, lack of housing (for natives + all the incoming migrants in vast numbers)

Its just that China gets most of the media coverage.

2016-01-08 18:04:54,"I think the jobs report wasn't very good (beneath the surface). There are indications the jobs created were mainly for under 21 and over 55.

This would mirror what's happening in the EU. Where most 'new' jobs are temporary / minimum wage / ""Zero Hours Contracts""


EDIT Added:

""consumer confidence""  (from decent jobs) always used to be an economic leading indicator and hence an important input to the Algorithms / Neural Networks / Kalman tracking filters for asset allocation / stock pricing. Maybe in these days of Big Data &amp; HFT they have less relevance? Maybe they still have weight?

There is still prob. of a bounce next week.

Another BIG positive was the rather large Block 'Buy on weakness' for VOO (S&amp;P500 ETF) and HYG (high yield bonds)


HYG is also showing a positive divergence (at last). It was the canary in the coal mine in 2015!

2016-01-08 17:14:48,"In this case we need to watch the action of bonds (TLT especially).

TLT has started to show some signs of weakening &amp; GLD recovering.


In a deflationary contraction, I'd expect TLT to go great guns.
However TBT (inverse bonds) doesn't appear to be falling with $spx as this case would suggest.


Of course this might change in the year(s) ahead...

2016-01-08 14:17:30,"hey!

sorry for my language before, so since you are like a real person, I thought I could ask for some clarification. does the data in the study represent 20,000 unique investors? If so, that seems like a large enough sample size that you shouldn't expect significant performance variation based on birthdate unless birthdate correlates with some other significant metric (perhaps people born in July are more likely to be &gt;65 years old). Do you have any way to check for such associations? 

I think it really devalues the entire data set (but good on you for being honest and including it in the report) because there's no apparent reason that there should be any significant correlation between birth date and investment performance. I expect all of these numbers should be within 1% of each other based on the range of variation for other metrics."

fact: spx has traded in about a 30-handle range from its intraday high to low since the last payroll # (nearly 4 weeks)

and it would be even longer than that if you took out the 8/2 low that took price down to 2147 ... we've essentially been chopping it up in this range since july 14th (6 weeks) and we're right back at this 2180 level (which has been about the  middle of the range that we've been in since the last jobs report) for what seems like the umpteenth time!

http://i.imgur.com/y3p6ZQq.png

i realize we've been in the summer doldrums and most traders are away ... hence the light volumes

and obviously nothing goes straight up, and the markets have recovered pretty massively since the brexit panic lows ...

but i'm wondering if this is just a correction through time ... or is something brewing under the hood so-to-speak?

perhaps this next payroll # on friday could be the catalyst to get things moving again ... and will give us some more clarity on the fed (albeit i am in the camp that the fed doesn't move in sept. even if we do see another strong jobs #)

i guess we find out soon where this resolves ... september is just around the corner!"

I'd prefer to start with Robinhood either way though, as like most other people, I'd rather risk $100 to get the gist (or at least to a degree), rather than risking/playing around with $25,000 or portions of that amount. 

Do you recommend any specific chatrooms? Also I agree with everything you're saying. You have to learn on your own, and even in real life, generally if I know something that someone else doesn't; I go with my gut. I think that in most things in life, and most certainly in speculative trading of any sort, you cannot trust the opinions of others. 

Also really? 5k a day? That translates to a whopping $140,000 per month! Holy! I'd dream to make that much. Do you know any people who make this much, or anything close to this just trading at home? Can I really make a fairly ok amount with just 25k deposited? Is it true that in stock trading, unlike FOREX trading, long-term trades are more profitable than short-term trades? 

Thank you a ton, and hopefully this is ok with you, but I would be eternally grateful if we could become friends. Your knowledge is incomparable, to be quite frank. Thank you again and hopefully you can reply. "

i understand ... you do make a good point there ... and honestly this may be something that we can change in the future ... but as for this week anyway since this is literally our very first weekly stock picking contest on r/StockMarket we'll have to just roll w/ this way of doing the contest

2016-07-17 01:11:34,"1 You need a highly dependable internet connection when risking money. If internet goes down you could lose everything. 
2 You need multiple access points if one connection goes down
3 You need a broker to trade through. 
4 You need to know what market you will trade Currencies, Equity, Commodities are the 3 markets available. 
5 You need a basic but solid understanding of mathematics. You need to learn how to calculate % increase/decrease. Memorizing fractions is good for this as well. If a stock is at $15 and you expect it to go to $17 what % will you make and vice versa? Practice these types of problem in your head throughout the day when you're bored. 

If you buy 500 shares how much money will you win or lose for each cent the price moves in either direction? The answer is $5. 
500 * .01 = 5 

Another one. 
10,000 shares? Easy just move the decimal 2 places to the left. 
$100 dollars is your risk. 

6 How to implement this in a real example 
You buy a stock and assume that it might move 10 cents against you but you really don't want to lose more than $50 if you are wrong. How many shares should you buy?
Well $50/10 = 5
You know that to only risk $5 per each cent means you multiply that by 100 and you get 500 shares. The answer is you should not trade more than 500 shares. 

Now you know how to manage risk. If you ever lose more than you intended then you know your bet size was too large."

2016-07-16 20:41:53,"$GEVO needs to get over $1.00. Investors are hoping for a deal, but it's unlikely and Gevo will most likely reverse split. Gevo is currently capped at producing 1.5 million gallons of isobutanol/year. Outfitting partner plants with their isobutanol separation technology is currently in their best interest. Gevo has a few railcar orders, but not much beyond that at this time. Gevo needs to get isobutanol production costs below $4.00/gallon, they need to build a commercial scale plant, and oil needs be in the $70/barrel range for ATJ fuel to really take off. Gevo turned things around in the past year by settling patent disputement with Butamax and getting ATJ-SPK approved for commercial flights. With oil as low as it is, there isn't much demand for biofuels at this time. I don't plan on adding to my small position until Gevo announces a source of funding for future plants. The goal here is to have some kind of stable infrastructure by 2020. There is plenty of time to get in, I personally think now is not the best time to enter."

2016-07-15 17:44:44,"From my understanding the only rule you really need to be careful with is the wash sale rule. Which says you can not claim a loss if you bought the same thing within 30 days on either side of that loss. Since we're talking TWLO if you bought the day it IPO'd and took a loss and then bought it back.... you'd be unable to write off that loss on taxes because the stock only started trading 2 weeks ago so the loss has occurred within 30 days of buying a materially similar stock.

It takes a stock 3 days to settle (It's been this way for at least 20 years) What the IRS and your broker are probably most concerned is that. If you buy lets say $1000 of a stock. You've spent 1000...If it's Monday then Tuesday lets just say for example it doubles due to and you sell... You now have $2000. That afternoon You decide to be safe and buy $1000 Stable Investment Inc Because the stock never goes down and pays a dividend. You now spent $1000 again. Well you only had 1000 in the account to start with but you've spent $2000. Friday everything will be fine but Wednesday afternoon it appears you've spent $2000.

I have a margin account. The brokerage lets me borrow money to trade with.... Let's just say for example I have 100k invested. (Made up numbers) Etrade lets me borrow 10k. Now I could in theory buy $20k of something but that's dangerous- because if it goes down 50% I just lost 10k and Etrade will want their money back at some point... I can pay them back- it just requires selling everything in my account to do so. 

 have a margin account which lets me borrow money to buy stocks with. But when I do buy I have cash in my account and I'm not buying more than what cash I have on hand. The margin is there to cover that 3 day spread. I bought TWLO Tuesday June 7th for $38.60 it went down Friday, Monday and up Tuesday I sold it Wednesday Morning for a slight profit. Thursday Morning after the huge rally I bought again at 43.90.... that Wednesday trade hasnt settled. So Etrade borrowed 43900 from my margin account to cover the expense. Monday That trade from 7/13 will settle putting 38,600 in the account. (So I owe Etrade 5300 at some point- but I have the cash in the account) 

I look at it like buying something for $40 on a credit card and having $100 cash in the bank. Ill make interest on the $100 and when the credit card bill comes due I have no problem paying off that $40. 

I'm hoping to sell my TWLO shares for $45 or higher- once I'm out of this trade I'm going to stop trading... and go back to my boring buy and hold."
2016-07-15 17:02:27,I bought in and have held onto them since.

I'd just like to be able to buy a few stocks here and there and hold for a bit then sell when I feel comfortable.

2016-07-15 15:32:15,"Nobody has even touched on their market cap, how much revenue pokemon go/future products will add to revenue (and how much their market cap has raised to reflect this revenue).  
  
How much revenue will Pokemon Go add over the future? How much with other succesful apps/games add? What are they priced for today? Im looking at stock price doubling over the last week or so, so is pokemon go doubling revenues? is the app going to be significant going into the future? what other ways to monetize does nintendo have here?  
  
I havnt done the work, but if i did Id look at how much net revenue Pokemon Go adds heading into the future, and whether the rising price reflects overvaluation or undervaluation of that. "
2016-07-15 15:25:35,They can still piggy back off of Niantic for a while. The game hasn't even opened up globally yet. And they are still going to add more revenue streams ([sponsored locations](http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-ads/))
2016-07-15 15:25:12,I will say - I sold too early yesterday
2016-07-15 15:21:07,"I like what they do I'll probably buy a few shares to hold. I've been trading and doing everything just slightly wrong. I've made money but with slightly better timing I'd have made a lot of money.... see below if you want a silly story.

I managed to buy some about 2 weeks at $38.60. Sold them the next morning for $40.50 for an easy 5%. June 6th I considered buying again. Didnt.... it shot from 33.75 to $38. Up 12%. I bought that nigh after hours for 39.60 and over the next 2 days went to $35.50...Two days later I was profitable and sold premarket at $40.40 for an 80c share gain. Two hours later when the market opened it gapped up to 41 and change and peaked at $42.75. The next day it gapped up again and I considered buying in early morning. It went up to $44.80.

It seems to have a habit of running, pulling back and running again so when it fell to $43.90 I bought again expecting a slight run up to close. It promptly dropped to 40.50 and finished the day around 41.25 Thursday. This morning it opened around 41.70 then went down slightly. It quickly recovered and shot to $42.90 then pulled back again.

The 3 biggest things I've learned this summer is - you need a system to short term trade, I dont think I have the stomach for short term trading....and three- it's time to stop."
2016-07-15 15:20:55,I think they are over valued. They IPO'd at $15. It seems way too quick of a boom to be valid.

So far It seems like they have a decent future, but I'm just not sure if they're overvalued right now and will start to drop some."
2016-07-15 13:52:00,"I bought in just under 42. As a developer, I really liked their pitch. "

2016-07-15 12:37:47,"At this point, my bet is that it still has more to go, but I'm unsure how much. People may do some profit taking in the next few days, but I'm going to continue holding."
2016-07-15 12:36:48,"It might go up, it might go down. It's definitely way overvalued. "

2016-07-15 10:41:07,"I understand you point, bit its not so much uncertainty as it is fear.

But as we have seen in the past, a terrorist attack does not affect sales at AAPL, so any short term sell offs because of tragic events like thats are usually short lived.

2016-07-15 09:52:14,Gold was very down?
2016-07-15 09:29:13,Great points. The attack just may just be fuel to the flames.
2016-07-15 09:22:02,"No definitely not to that extent. But it think it may be having a little more effect than most other (relatively minor) attacks have had in the past. This is of course on top of what /WaveRapture mentioned
I think to expect uncertainty to carry over into the US markets today is my main point."
2016-07-15 08:58:18,"Sure, but i don't think this is because of the Attack.

1. The past 1-2 days have been pretty good for Europe (Mainly the DAX).
--&gt; DAX is already pretty high (too high in most opinions)

2. The BoE didn't lower their key interest rate, which everyone expected --&gt; negative for Europe.

3. Wait till the DAX gets the 10100 today... it could go down afterwards, but testing the upper barriers is what everybody wants to do today.

So my guess is, we'll see the 10100 today and go downwards to about 9900."

2016-07-14 17:17:10,I dont think options count towards wash sale rule- because you may have paid for the contract months ago. If you buy a contract in January to buy shares at a price of say $55 by a July and the price is at $70 in July. You exercise the contract paying $5500 for 100 shares at $55 and sell it for $70/share later that day- $7000 cash and a profit of $1500. You may have legally owned the stock for hours or minutes- but because you bought the contract months ago the wash rule wouldnt be applicable.

well I kinda wrote a ""book""...its not really a book, really short, its on kindle though. its called How markets stay efficient. I think I put it on sale, though its free if you have kindle unlimited or something. i just put it up there for fun. anybody who buys it and doesnt think its worth the money, i'll refund in bitcoin. The book is mostly about how arbitrage strategies work and how prices are kept in line with other assets.

2016-07-14 05:40:27,yeah. I totally agree to this one. Great insight!!
2016-07-14 05:39:00,"Remember the whole idea is to buy low and sell high, I will also recommend that you buy and hold cos stock have relative higher value over a longer time. i.e long term investment."
2016-07-14 05:32:15,"Pretty easy. Good thing is you are above 18 years so no need for a custodian account. Therefore you just need to open an account with a very good broker, with a reasonable amount, then you can start buying stocks. "
2016-07-14 05:27:03,"To buy and sell stocks you need to set up an account with a broker.  If you have a close personal relationship with a broker at one of the ""bulge bracket"" firms such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley, it may be worthwhile maintaining that relationship, but the commissions are expensive. Most people prefer a discount broker, of which the three most popular are Schwab, Fidelity and TD Ameritrade.  Other good discount brokers include Interactive Brokers and Scottrade.  Don't get hypnotized by your screen, and try to trade for the intermediate or long term."
2016-07-14 02:13:11,fidelity or etrade I don't trade though so they might have higher commissions compared to others.
2016-07-13 22:23:47,"Well I know what that is, and I know I have to to go through a brokage firm that will do it with a American deposit receipt but I was wondering which firms you would recommend to broker through?"

They have made very few blunders from what I have seen."
2016-07-13 15:52:50,I've been making a reasonable amount everyday but today tanked! Gutted but in it for the long haul so treating it as a learning experience. Definitely going to focus on fewer stocks with high investments in future 
2016-07-13 15:44:43,"The way I went about it when I started trading was to ignore the trading fee, but just focus on the trading aspect. As you get more experience and feel more comfortable, you'll feel more comfortable investing larger amounts, making the fee less significant.
