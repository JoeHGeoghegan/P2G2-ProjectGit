Fed seen raising U.S. interest rates further to battle hot inflation By Reuters

By Ann Saphir

(Reuters) - Fresh data showing underlying U.S. inflation remained stubbornly hot in May are building a case for a longer string of sharp Federal Reserve interest rate hikes than previously expected, with policymakers primed next week to signal they will have to be more aggressive.

Rising food and record fuel prices pushed the consumer price index (CPI) up 8.6% last month from a year earlier, a U.S. Labor Department report showed Friday, shattering any hopes that inflation had peaked the prior month.

Core CPI - which strips out volatile gas and food prices - rose 6%, down slightly from April's 6.2% pace but far from the ""clear and convincing"" sign of cooling price pressures that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he needs to see before slowing rate hikes.

""So much for the idea that inflation has peaked,"" wrote Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride. ""Any hopes that the Fed can ease up on the pace of rate hikes after the June and July meetings now seems to be a longshot.""

Fed policymakers have already all but promised half-point interest rate hikes at their next two meetings - the first next week, and the second in late July.

Some had thought that by September their own rate hikes, along with easing supply chain pressures and an expected shift in household spending away from supply-constrained goods and toward services, would have started to ease price pressures.

Friday's inflation read report suggested the opposite.

Used car prices, which had been sinking, reversed course and rose 1.8% from the prior month; airline fares rose by 12.6% from the prior month, and 37.8% from a year earlier. Prices for shelter - where trends tend to be particularly persistent - rose 5.5%, the biggest jump since February 1991.

Those figures suggest U.S. central bankers may stay locked into half-point increases through their September meeting and even beyond as they try to wrangle inflation lower by slowing the economy.

Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate are now betting on half-point rate hikes at least through September, with some chance of an even bigger rate hike before then. Contracts reflect expectations for the policy rate to end the year in the 3%-3.25% range.

The Fed's current policy rate target is now 0.75%-1%. Fed officials want to get it higher without undermining a historically tight labor market and sending the economy into recession.

May's inflation report appears to make that task even harder.

""These are ugly numbers...I‚Äôd say we‚Äôll probably be in a recession in the fourth quarter of this year with confirmation in the second quarter of 2023,‚Äù said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.

14,Will someone please explain to me how raising interest rates is supposed to fight this inflation?,6,v9fhsr,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v9fhsr/will_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_raising/,9,"So I understand that raising interest rates makes it harder for people who are out of money to borrow money to buy more stuff, but this inflation is rampant across everything, not just discretionary items. When people run out of money and they have to borrow it to pay for gas and groceries, it seems to me that they will do that and when they can't pay The credit card bill, they will just stop paying it. Then, they just give up, quit their jobs, and go on government assistance which makes the tax burden even more on those who are still working.

What's the big plan here that the Fed has to keep everything running and yet have interest rates cause inflation to go down?

I think the root cause of the problem we are having now, is the lack of competition as companies have gotten bigger and bigger they have pushed out their competitors and now we are left thinly sourced on many key items. So what incentive to do those massive companies have to control prices, they simply look at the margin they need to make and price things accordingly.

 In reality, the ones getting hurt by inflation are those sitting on cash and those who are out of cash. This seems is a very tough situation  and I don't see how relying on the Fed to get inflation under control is going to work. It seems to me that the only answer will be a deep recession, throwing a lot of people out of work, and then maybe prices will have to come down because nobody will be buying the stuff. However, the lack of competition will raise its head again in the future so we will just be running in circles until that problem is resolved. Thoughts?",1654889263.0

21,Please Critique My Recession Investment Plan,1,v9jgnn,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v9jgnn/please_critique_my_recession_investment_plan/,9,"Hi all,
Hope this post is okay for this sub! 

So I've spent the past year learning about trading and investing in the stock market.
Not a long time, I know, but I've learned a lot in that time, compared with when I started. 
I've spent some time lately more or less day trading, and while I'm getting decent at it, all that time spent on the computer, looking at charts,  whilst being enjoyable in one sense, also feels a little unhealthy in other ways. 
So I'm considering longer term investing as opposed to day or swing trading - this means less time online, which would be nice. Potentially less gains, but since day trading is risky in itself, not necessarily. 

So that brings me to the point of this post.
My potential plan for the next 3 years:

Firstly, it's looking like we're in a recession - not about to enter one, I think we're well into it at this stage, and it's going to get worse. 
Looking at the 2000 and 2008 crashes, the markets could drop 50-60% from its peak over 1 - 2 years. So let's split the difference and say we do 55% over a year and a half. So, my plan is simply to short the market, or more specifically short ETFs, possibly leveraged like SQQQ.

Secondly, I'd sell as the market shows signs of bottoming out, or maybe just get out early, around -40%, wait, and get back in, again probably with leveraged ETFs like TQQQ.

I know this plan might sound very simple, but tbh that's why I find it so appealing. I don't find it that risky, either. I don't think anybody would argue that the market is in a downtrend, and odds are much more downside.
When the bottom comes, the risk of purchasing the S&P, NASDAQ, etc. even if leveraged, is extremely minimal.
I can't get liquidated by trying to short a volatile market with ETFs, either.

Please point out the flaws in my plan, or if you think it's reasonable, and why.

All thoughts welcome!",1654900514.0

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks¬†are looking to open lower this morning after volatility returned to the market yesterday. After trading in a tight range for the past couple weeks, SPY finally broke out of the range to the downside, breaking down through multiple support levels. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' May CPI showed an increase of 8.6% YoY. This was higher than the expected 8.3%. This is also the highest rate of inflation for the US in over 40 years. Stocks sold off right as the CPI data came out, I'm expecting the volatility to continue today. I'll watch 400 as a key resistance level for SPY, looking for more weakness if it fails to regain that level. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are down¬†\~80 basis points, Dow Futures are¬†down \~65 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~1.1%. Key resistance level for SPY at 400, with other relevant resistance levels at 404, 407, 408, and 410. Relevant support levels at 397.50, 396, 394, 390, and 385. Crude oil is still holding up well, currently trading around $122 per barrel. Energy stocks still worth following today and into next week. Chinese stocks are seeing relative strength in premarket, worth keeping an eye on today.¬†

In  a thread on Twitter, Elon Musk flew to the aid of cinemas, an industry whose death has been pronounced for several years now. That premature announcement stems from the explosion of streaming video and plus studios' decisions during the pandemic to release movies as premium video on demand.

It all started with a Twitter user recounting his experience after quitting Diet Coke. Musk commented by praising Diet Coke. He then took the opportunity to slip two compliments to movie theaters. The second one sounds like a cry from the heart:

""Diet Coke is amazing, especially the soda fountain version at movie theaters with salt & butter popcorn,"" Musk said.

I look atar the page views and engagement on my own properties and I can assure you we are down more than 50% all across the board.
The same issue with thousands of host beamoaning this with Airbnb and calling them without any resolution in sight. This hasn‚Äôt hit the news yet and the support and community admins are denying it or simply closing their eyes on it since they can‚Äôt back paddle right now of their redesign. 

This is the summer and the busiest season for airbnb hosts and yet, our June this year is worse than the June in 2020. 

This might be anecdotal evidence, but from personal experience in this space and sifting through hundreds of posts and comments from hosts reporting the same issues, I think this is going to be the worst quarterly report Airbnb is going to put out. I‚Äôm buying puts expiring after their release.

The following is my guestimate, if you have anything to share, please let me know.  See if we can come up with something before market close. 

Main CPI components are shelter (40%), transportation (20%), food (15%), medical (8%), education (6%), recreation (6%).  Break down further, you can figure total energy weight around 9% (fuels in transportation and home energy usage). 

Rent is down in May (10% vs 10.6% in Apr, www.apartments.com), airline tickets and entertainment weights too small to really matter, goods are unlike to go up given the excess retail inventory.  So, food and energy would be the drivers. 
  
Use DBA and USO as proxy, we can estimate that food and energy price increase in May would contribute to about 1.2% CPI increase in May (USO gained 18.2% (use average 9.1%) and DBA up 5.6% (use average 2.8%) from Apr low to May high, then add up the weighted average).  

CPI increased 0.8% from Apr 2021 to May 2021.  Base effect alone not sufficient to have a lower YOY CPI.  

That‚Äôs how far I got.  Given that market has bounced, and I have no way/run out of time to estimate decline in other components.  My current thinking is to sit out this trade.  Unless you guys convince me otherwise.",1654804110.0

So, we think the consumer can handle that,‚Äù said Kolanovic, who has earned top honors from Institutional Investor for accurate forecasts multiple years in a row.

His base case is the U.S. and global economy will avoid a recession.

Northwest Bio reads out its phase 3 trial results for their personalized dendritic cell (immune system) vaccine for brain cancer. The results are statistically significant, have almost zero side effects, have a long tail survival curve, and they have built out their manufacturing so can get it to market upon approval. Additionally, they have orphan drug status and Promising Innovative Medicine status in the UK. The promising innovative medicines fund just announced yesterday they have approved a $350mm fund to help patients pay for drugs within the program prior to insurance reimbursement approval (near term revenue opportunity as regulation and insurance process plays out). Cost right now is $200k cash (will be much less when final insurance reimbursement happens) and they are approved to treat 50 patients per month in the UK.

Early stage trials have also shown promise in 15 other solid tumor cancers. The vaccine works by taking out as much tumor as possible and taking a blood draw from the patient. They personalize the vaccine based on your own tumor biomarkers and ""teach"" your immune system to recognize those biomarkers and re-inject the vaccine into you.",1654794733.0

I'm not in IB or anything; I engineer financial software. So maybe I have a bit of a bias here, but I've been following ""blue chip"" tech stocks this past cycle. I'm specifically referring to the companies that offer hardware or services that the economy can't function without. Like servers or cybersecurity tools. My biggest gainers this quarter have been trades around the earnings of CRWD, SPLK, and HPE. 

I'm wondering what the thoughts are on how a recession would impact these kinds of companies? In my mind, a recession and/or inflation necessitates the savings that further investment in automation creates via productivity gains or lower costs via wages, etc. Also, changing geopolitics help justify spending if it improves security. 

Risks are obviously silicon supply chain-related, as well as rising rates. The latter requires greater net value at the time of investment. The first is almost universal, so comparatively, I'm not sure how much greater the risk is compared to other industries.

The actions, announced Tuesday, come after a pronounced spending shift by Americans, from investments in their homes to money spent on experiences like travel and nights out for dinner and other pre-pandemic routines.

Here is an analysis I made on Tradingview that seems to be forming head and shoulders on DAX. It is important to note that **it is only forming as of right now** and **it is not confirmed yet.**

DAX seems to be forming a Head and Shoulders pattern, clearly visible in the H1 timeframe.

There is still strong support EMA (4H, 34) in the way and the formation is not finished or confirmed yet, so at this point, we are only OBSERVING if the formation will be finished. If not, we do not enter the trade.

>Entry1: At the close of the first H1/H4 candle below the neckline  
Entry2: On pullback to the neckline (if occurs and conviction is strong)

**Exit:** As always we use multiple Take Profits. The furthest one we are aiming toward the 14326 price level - which is the nearest support.

**Stop Loss:** We will put Stop Loss above the nearest leg up on smaller timeframes (30m, 1h), which should be around 14500.

This should give us a **Risk to Reward ratio of around 3**. By using multiple Take Profits along the way (aiming at the 14400 and 14360 price levels) we will bring the Risk to Reward ratio down to about 2

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8% to 33,180.14, the S&P 500 was up by 1% to 4,160.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 0.9% to 12,175.23.

The energy sector led gainers while consumer discretionary was the sole decliner, weighed down by Target ([TGT](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-TGT/news/)) cutting its operating margin guidance for the fiscal second quarter.

The retail giant said it plans to reduce its inventory balance for the remainder of the year through actions including canceling orders. It now expects the operating margin to be about 2% for the fiscal second quarter, down from its guidance last month for the rate to be close to its first-quarter figure of 5.3%. Shares of the department store chain slid 2.4%.

Walmart ([WMT](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-WMT/news/)) and Home Depot ([HD](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HD/news/)) also closed lower.

Global economic growth will likely lose momentum this year, with the Ukraine war, soaring inflation and rising interest rates threatening what is now considered ""a precarious recovery,"" World Bank said Tuesday. Real gross domestic product is now seen rising 2.9% in 2022, significantly lower than a 4.1% rise previously projected in January. The US economy is expected to expand 2.5% this year, down 1.2 percentage points from the prior forecast.

The US 10-year yield declined by 5.9 basis points to 2.98%.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures climbed by $1.46 to $119.96 per barrel. Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for average Brent crude oil prices through the first half of 2023 by $10 per barrel as it sees supply remaining insufficient to meet demand.

""Supply remains inelastic to higher prices with core-OPEC (higher) and exempt countries (lower) production shifts broadly offsetting,"" the investment bank said in a report. ""On the demand side, the negative global growth impulse remains insufficient to rebalance inventories at current prices.""

In economic news, the US trade deficit narrowed to $87.08 billion in April from $107.65 billion in the previous month, beating estimates for an $89.5 billion gap, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

In company news, Apple ([AAPL](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/news/)) suffered a setback on Tuesday after the European Union reached a provisional agreement on a mandatory common charging port for electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. Still, Apple closed 1.8% higher.

Redbook reported that US same-store retail sales were up 12.4% year-over-year in the week ended June 4, slower than a 12.6% gain in the prior week that included the lead-up to Memorial Day.

Gold was up $11.40 to $1,855.10 per troy ounce and silver was up $0.17 to $22.27 per ounce. Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund was up 1.9% to $90.04, and the United States Natural Gas Fund was down 0.3% to $31.72.",1654656224.0

‚Ä¢	Will hold puts if SIG fails to rally. In the worst case, we own SIG at a 12% discount to its current price of about $63

------------

Situation

Severe difficulties, turnaround since 2018, strong financials, low valuation, negative sentiment, major uncertainties

‚Ä¢	SIG share price declined 95% from its 2015 high of $150 to 2020 low of $6. A new CEO took over in July 2017

‚Ä¢	Multi-year efforts to optimize store fleet, operating efficiency, digital platform, supply chain finally began to payoff

‚Ä¢	FY22 REV and EPS grew 49.7% and 482% from FY21. Ending FY22 with $1.4 bn cash, a leverage ratio of 1.9, and a lean inventory. Consensus FY23 REV and EPS $7.99 bn and $11.38, up 2.1% and down 7.3% from FY22, respectively

‚Ä¢	High inflation, Fed tightening, macro uncertainties, and downbeat outlooks from retailers depressed sentiment 

Analysis

Aggregate retail sales unlikely to decline, valuation near bottom, SIG performance sustainable, positive surprise likely

‚Ä¢	Aggregate retail sales has not and likely will not decline significantly

o	Retail sales rose 1.7%, 1.4%, 0.9% MoM in Feb, Mar, Apr 2022, exceeding previous highs despite market turmoil

o	While 07-09 crisis saw S&P 500, personal income (PI), retail sales (RS) decline 52%, 7% and 12% respectively from peak to trough, PI and RS actually rose 5.2% in the 99-02 bear market when S&P 500 declined 46%

o	07-09 was a credit crisis where global financial system nearly failed, while 99-02 was a liquidity bubble bursting

o	No credit crisis in the current downturn.  Market may decline further, but odds of a drastic PI and RS decline low 

‚Ä¢	While latest retailer ERs mixed, it confirms that demand remains strong, and retail stock valuation is near bottom

o	Share prices of WMT, TGT, and others plunged 10-30% while TPR, WSM, and others jumped 10-30% post ER

o	Consumer demand remained strong, but spending shifted from stay-home to reopening categories. Both luxury (LVMH, CAPI) and discount retailers (DG, DLTR) do well if they manage merchandising, inventory, and cost well

o	Retailers of good fundamentals and lower valuations do well even when their ER misses (TPR, TJX, CPRI, M, et al)

‚Ä¢	Caliber CEO, numerous initiatives, outperforming the industry, and the outperformance is likely to continue 

o	Global jewelry retail fragmented, SIG as the largest player only has 3% share, room for growth and consolidation

o	CEO grew Olay brand from $200mm to $2.5bn in sales at P&G, using a similar playbook for SIG initiatives

ÔÇß	Fill gaps with acquisitions, sharper differentiation, better assortment, increasing units sold and selling price

ÔÇß	Data analytics to optimize store location, marketing, promotion, up/cross selling, inventory, store staffing

ÔÇß	Enhance omni-channel capabilities, supply chain reliability, labor productivity and reduce SG&A costs

o	Transformation resulted in faster growth, better margin, doing more with less, but is still in early stage

ÔÇß	Outgrew industry by 19 points (49% vs. 30%), inventory turnover up by 55%, digital sales tripled in FY22

ÔÇß	Reduced store counts by 20% while grew sales by 25% and expanded operating margin by 220 bps in 4 years

ÔÇß	Turnaround since 2018, stock rebounded since 2020 after a 5-year decline, early-stage recovery

‚Ä¢	Consensus estimate conservative, a Q1 beat and guidance affirmation amid uncertainty would be a positive surprise

o	SIG guides FY23 industry sales to be slightly down to flat, lower than 4-8% growth forecast by industry analysts

o	FY23 retail sales unlikely to decline, planned weddings are at 40-year higher, bridal sales 50% of SIG revenue

o	Better sector growth and advantage in scale and execution suggest consensus FY23 REV likely conservative

o	SIG has pricing power. Its margin guide likely conservative. A higher REV at a stable margin leads to a higher EPS

o	Latest MasterCard spending data suggests a much stronger Q1 FY23 sales than consensus REV. A Q1 beat likely

Conclusion

‚Ä¢	With strong fundamentals, low valuation, elevated shorts, SIG likely to rally at a positive surprise

Chances are you‚Äôve heard the statement, ‚Äú95% of actively managed funds failed to outperform the market over the last 20 years.‚Äù Maybe the percentage is not always the same, but it is always a very high number that underperform the market.

Today, we want to dive into this debate and beyond just the surface statistics. This statement is promulgated so much that it has become the end all be all in most investing circles without any further research being done to see how ‚Äútrue‚Äù this statement and its implications actually are.

## The Quote Comes From This Report:

Every year since 2002 [the SPIVA active vs passive report card](https://www.ifa.com/articles/despite_brief_reprieve_2018_spiva_report_reveals_active_funds_fail_dent_indexing_lead_-_works/) has shown that passive investing generally outperforms active investing.

https://preview.redd.it/h2x1lh86q4491.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b40884ca77e39e0f15bf951096804bf9568c966

Depending on the funds you compare it to, they underperform anywhere from 78.95% of the time to 99.71% of the time. This is quite significant, but remember, this is over 20 years. So at least a fraction of these funds have proven that they can outperform. Out of the fraction of funds that do outperform, maybe it‚Äôs possible that it is not just random, but that there are funds that consistently outperform due to good management and strategy.

## If We Visit Kiplinger We Can Find a List Of These Funds That Have Outperformed

https://preview.redd.it/jstb1k0aq4491.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4695cf2c76b81cdd3ce991e97b7c90054be65f4

According to portfoliovisualizer.com SPY has returned an average CAGR of 9.09% non-inflation adjusted since January of 2002 (ending in March of 2022). So as we can see all of these funds beat the overall market over the last twenty years by at least two percent.

And just in case you‚Äôre wondering how significant a two percent change in returns is, it correlates to roughly 2x over forty years.

This is a very significant change! Which makes me think that our investigation into mutual funds is not in vain.

So let‚Äôs compare the second fund, FOCPX against VFINX in portfolio visualizer.

https://preview.redd.it/ddvaulzhq4491.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a518f082f6ba6bdde845bedc60d1bf7b5cdb42

FOCPX over the course of 37 years from inception has beat the market by a significant margin. However, this image does not really show the whole picture.

*Why you may ask?*

Because it does not account for headwinds or tailwinds in the equities market. You see, even though we know the market returns 10% *on average,* that average is taken over a decades-long time frame. As you begin to approach 40-50 years your returns will smooth out, but up until that point they can be highly dependent on prevailing market conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/a5347ddkq4491.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1dd86811b1a43564eb801767343f196736c86dc

As you can see throughout history there have been long periods of no real returns in the stock market as well as periods where the market 10x‚Äôd in only a decade or two. When comparing an index fund against a mutual fund this should be something that we account for, as the *when* we invest is about as important as the *what* we invest in.

Anyone can cherry-pick data and make an investment appear to perform better than it actually does, but we‚Äôre not trying to cherry-pick data, we‚Äôre trying to look at the investment from different angles so we can see all of its possible merits and drawbacks.

In the case of FOCPX, we‚Äôre looking at it decade by decade as well as during bull markets and markets with zero returns to give a more complete picture.

* 1985 - 1990 FOCPX **outperformed the index** (15.66% CAGR) by 3.84% a year not only in total returns, but also risk-adjusted. (Sharpe: 0.61 to 0.52)
* 1990 - 2000 FOCPX **outperformed the index** (15.3% CAGR) by 1.91% a year, although not on a risk-adjusted basis.
* 2000 - 2010 FOCPX **underperformed the index** (0.32% CAGR) by 0.4% a year leaving you with a non-inflation adjusted negative return.
* 2010 - 2020 FOCPX **outperformed the index** (13.83% CAGR) by 5.71% a year on a risk-adjusted basis. (Sharpe 1.05 to 0.96)
* For the 1985 - 2000 Bull market FOCPX **outperformed the index** (16.72% CAGR) by 2.89% a year, although surprisingly not on a risk-adjusted basis.
* For the 2000 - 2013 Flat market FOCPX **underperformed the index** on a total return basis by 0.83% a year (1.53% CAGR for the index) although when adjusting for the risk, it outperformed.

*(And remember that these returns account for the expense ratio of FOCPX)*

Over most periods (predominantly bull markets) FOCPX has proved capable of beating the index. The time where it struggles against the index were chiefly bear/stagflation environments.

Intuitively, this makes complete sense when we take a look at how the fund categorizes itself. *Large Growth* is quite responsive to extended bull markets but tends to get hammered during bear markets. Its current asset allocation puts it at over 46% in the tech sector.

Most periods of time also happen to be dominated by bull markets, in fact, according to [this article](https://www.rbcgam.com/en/ca/learn-plan/investment-basics/investing-at-all-time-highs/detail) the market hits an all-time high on average, sixteen times a year. **That comes out to be an all-time high every 22.8 days!**

With this being the case, it is no wonder that FOCPX performs well.

## So What About The Other Funds? How Do They Perform?

Well as we mentioned before, this is highly dependent on not just *what* the funds invest in, but also *when* you invest in them.

This idea takes me back to the book by James O‚ÄôShaughnessy *What Works On Wall Street.* At the beginning of the book, he talks about how consistency is the real key when it comes to investing. When we change strategies every five minutes we never really know what actually works, because strategies often work over years and decades rather than days or months. A particular investing strategy may underperform over a specified period, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a bad investment per se.

Mutual funds, just like index funds are vulnerable to the concept of [sequence of return risk](https://www.kitces.com/blog/url-upside-potential-sequence-of-return-risk-in-retirement-median-final-wealth/), even during the growth period and not just the retirement period of an investor‚Äôs life. As the chart above would indicate, investing in an index fund could have zero returns over a long period if you invest at the wrong time.

One of the most legendary investors of all time, Warren Buffett has had periods where he underperformed the general indexes, but that doesn‚Äôt make him a bad investor. On the contrary, we look at his entire performance over the years and conclude that he can accurately pick stocks and outperform the market averages.

I think this should be the same light that we view mutual funds or other constructed portfolios. To say that because a fund underperformed for a few years makes it a bad investment is short-sighted.

To overcome this we simply need to look at the funds from different angles to get the most complete picture of how effective they are (or not effective they are) over different time periods and market conditions. When we more accurately see the risk profile of a fund or portfolio we can stick with it even when it seems to underperform.

## So again, how did the other funds perform?

Well, since inception, all of them except one (VHIAX) outperformed the market. Five of the ten funds failed to beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis, (even though they managed to beat it on a total return basis) these include FKDNX, CPOAX, USNQX, VHIAX, and NASDX.

(In the case of lower risk-adjusted returns, it simply means that if we used leverage to up the returns of our index fund we could get to the same level of risk but with more returns. Obviously, this is not ideal because if we can get better returns with the same level of risk, why bother investing in a mutual fund? [If you want to read more about this you can check out this other article about leveraged index funds](https://premiumincomeinvestments.substack.com/p/using-debt-to-make-our-portfolio?r=1awcwu&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).)

To continue though, we see that FDGRX beat the market over each of the four decades (not quite four but almost) while only losing to the index on a risk-adjusted (but not total return) basis for one decade. Even over the lost decade, FDGRX managed to beat the overall market on a risk-adjusted and total return basis.

FOCPX did not fare near as well, however, it did beat the market over three of the four decades since its inception on a risk-adjusted basis. The fund did not beat the market over the lost decade either.

AMAGX was the next fund that beat the market (risk-adjusted) since its inception. It was created in 1995 and over the three decades (roughly) that the fund has been in existence, it has beaten the index risk-adjusted for all of them. Surprisingly, this actually includes the lost decade. AMAGX managed to beat the index on a risk-adjusted basis by over 3% a year during this period.

YAFFX is one of the newer funds which makes it a bit less trustworthy than the others (inception date 1997) but for the two and a half decades in its existence, it managed to beat the index for two whole decades on a risk-adjusted basis. (2017 until now has not been too kind to the fund as it underperformed the index‚Äôs CAGR of 16% by about 2.5% a year) The crazy thing about this fund is that it **INSANELY** outperformed the index over the lost decade. In fact, if you had looked at this fund alone you might assume that *there never actually was a lost decade.* **From 2000 to 2010 this fund managed an 11.82% CAGR compared to the index‚Äôs 0.32% on a risk-adjusted basis.**

Last up we have FCNTX, which over the four decades since its inception (1985) has not failed to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis over any of them, *including the lost decade.* Its returns over the lost decade aren‚Äôt quite as impressive as YAFFX, however, it did still manage to outperform by about 4% a year.

## So Should We Consider Mutual Funds As A Viable Investment?

Based on the data I would say we can safely say that they are a *viable* investment. However, the question of whether there are other good investment alternatives out there? There definitely are. Mutual funds are by no means perfect, but the main point of this article was to dispel the myth that seems to be common in indexing circles that mutual funds are as good as worthless.

Typically mutual funds are attacked from several angles:

1. They have high expense ratios. This is by far one of the most common arguments. In today‚Äôs world, anything above the 0.05-0.1% expense ratio is considered expensive and not worth investing in. And this does have merit if the fund you invest in only ever underperforms. Not only do you lose out to the market, but you have to pay more for doing so.
2. They oftentimes underperform the market. This is the other really common argument against mutual funds, which according to the SPIVA report is completely accurate. As you could see, only half of the funds on the list from Kiplinger even beat the market since inception on a risk-adjusted basis.
3. It‚Äôs simpler to invest in the total market, which is completely valid. But if you want to simplify your investments and not think about them, why are you reading this in the first place? And why do these people participate in investing forums? With the time they spend writing and reading investment news and keeping up with current markets they might as well direct their energy into finding out-performers. Again this point is highly dependent on an individual‚Äôs personality, some people enjoy looking for investments and others do not.
4. Past performance of a mutual fund is no indicator of future returns. This statement gets said all the time, specifically by index fund advocates. This assertion, like many of the others, is also correct. Past data can never 100% predict future returns, if it did, everybody would be millionaires off of the stock market. Now given that, at the same time, past performance is *one of the best indicators of future returns that we have.* After all, what else besides past data can we use to predict future returns? (Even company fundamental data is considered ‚Äúpast‚Äù data.) However, one thing that I‚Äôve noticed consistently is that index fund advocates like to say this and follow it up with the performance of the indexes over the past century as proof of why they are safe/good investments. I have nothing against them, and even own index funds myself, but it does seem a bit hypocritical.
5. Management changes from time to time. This is not really something I accounted for in this analysis, but if you decide to take a shot at analyzing mutual funds yourself, then this should definitely play a factor in your pick. If a superstar mutual fund manager leaves, it‚Äôs possible that the superstar mutual fund performance will as well.
6. Lastly, mutual funds with the best performances are usually closed to new investors. This is not really a surprising revelation considering what the implications of running an open fund are for the managers. If an open mutual fund outperforms over a series of years, investors will be more likely to want to invest in it to get a slice of the action. The problem is that when a fund expands rapidly like this, the fund manager has to deploy this capital somehow or risk underperforming. However, if they deploy the capital into their already existing holdings, they go more concentrated than would be ideal. This rapid expansion of capital for deployment is possibly the cause that kills its outperformance that made it attractive in the first place. In our example from above, we see one of the best funds of the group, FDGRX, as being a closed fund. If an investor can get access to one of these funds by either being gifted shares thus allowing them to purchase more or being offered them through a retirement plan, it might be wise to investigate its performance and possibly purchase it.

There are a lot more aspects of mutual funds that could be touched on of their pros and cons, but hopefully, this post has convinced you that mutual funds are not the devil that they have been made out to be. Do your research and it is possible to find good funds, and like all strategies, it should not make up 100% of your portfolio else you risk underperformance during a bad period.",1654577580.0

&#x200B;

* Stock splits have triggered short-term rallies in the past, and Amazon shares are up over 4,300% since its last stock split was announced
* A stock split basically means that one single share gets split into multiple shares, it‚Äôs like trading ONE $20 bill for TWENTY $1 bills
* Mathematically, stock splits don't create any ""new value"" for owners, or fundamentally change anything about a company.¬†However, they can provide short-term momentum.
* Stock Splits can be seen as a marketing maneuver, aimed at making a high-priced stocks more affordable to retail investors and also make options contracts more affordable
* Bank of America research analysts found that since 1980, S&P 500 companies that announced stock splits ""significantly outperformed the index 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial announcement."" Over 12 months, stocks that announced splits gained an average of 25% compared, to¬†a 9% gain in the S&P 500.¬†
* My prediction, is that Amazon will also be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (a¬†group of America‚Äôs top 30 companies), forcing Index Funds which mirror the DOW, to purchase Amazon shares now
* Adding high-priced shares to the Dow is problematic because the index is price weighted instead of market cap weighted, meaning the same percentage move matters more for a high priced stock than a low priced one.
* Apple, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, which brought it from over $600 a share, to less than $100 per share, and it joined the Dow in 2015.
* An Amazon spokesperson¬† said the split-adjusted share price will make shares more accessible to potential investors and give employees more flexibility in how they manage their stock in the company
* This is Amazon's first stock split in over 20 years, since the dot-com bubble., and the fourth since Amazon‚Äôs IPO in 1997. Amazon did a 2-for-1 split on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 split on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 split on Sept. 2, 1999.
* Many other tech companies recently has stock splits as well. Google announced a 20-for-one split in February, Apple announced a 4-for-1 split in August 2020, Tesla announced a 5-to-1 split on August 2020 (Nvidia announced a 4-to-1 split in July 2021.)",1654625930.0

https://preview.redd.it/v1exiqyjxz391.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99001ee9ce1859a82d2d7fbd6430667a2b5b383

# First of all,

This analysis may be a bit longer, but it might be a worthwhile read no matter, if are looking for new Stocks to invest or not. I will go through diffrent metrics, that affect the supply and demand side of any given Stock and therefore help us evaluate the fair share price.

Investing your own money should always be taken very seriously, therefore I won\`t just write ‚ÄûLFG to the Moon!‚Äú, pls don't invest your money solely on MEME\`s and do your own research.

In the current Market condition some Companies are severely undervalued, but as always in history they will bend towards their ‚Äûfair‚Äú Valuation over time. Our target as Investors is to find those Companies that are not yet appropriately valued by the markets and/or have simply been overlooked.

In my estimation $DTC is such a Company, which flew under the radar for too long, while having high revenue growth year-over-year and a profitable business model and some more positive factors.

I will try to make the nitty-gritty stuff as easy to understand as possible, while not being too simplistic. For a an nice overview of current fundamentals take a look at: [https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands)

# The Business model

To determine the demand side we have to take a thorough look at Solo Brands ($DTC) business model. They are acquiring new brands with name recognition, that have a dedicated following in the Consumer base. They are owner of brands like Solo Stove and Cubbies, therefor fill a lucrative niche in the market. Their sales consist partly from retail vendors (‚âà 15%), but are especially driven through online Markets (‚âà85%), which offers easier growth opportunity and greater profit margins. Expansion into international Markets began in Oct. 2021 and will be one of the largest contributing growth factors in the coming years.

DTC\`s stock market performance is not what I would call stellar so far and has dropped into dirt cheap territory. Allthough $DTC beat the last two Quarter earnings, share price has fallen by over 75% over 6 month. This could offer a great opportunity for investors to enter, but in order to determine this we have to assess the ""fair"" value of $DTC.¬†

Further Info:[https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/](https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/)

# Determine Fair Value

We can determine the fair Valuation of DTC by comparing it to similar Companies in the Leisure/Outdoor Industry. if we compare metrics like Price-to-Earnings, Price-to-Sales and Price-To-Book of the broader Industry, a clear picture emerges.

A good example to see how undervalued $DTC is, is the P/B ratio. The current Book Value of $DTC is 571M, while Market Cap. is only 493M, this means a P/B of 0.8x, the Leisure/Outdoor Industry Avr. is 2.6x, which means $DTC is trading more then three times cheaper in this regards.

An exact valuation is highly complex and would take several pages to lay out, but $DTC outperforms the U.S Leisure Industry in every metric based of EoY expectation. The analyst consensus lies at 13.33$ per share. My own evaluation, in context of the current market condition lies around 11$ a share and I tried to be a little more conservative.¬†

# Outstanding Shares, Free Float and Supply

DTC issued 63.4M shares at IPO and did not dilute their shareholder since then. Shares hold by Insiders and long term institutions belong the the pool of Outstanding Shares (O/S). Shares hold by the Public, Short Hedgefunds (SHF) and mid-term holding Institutions belong to the free float.

The smaller the free float of shares, the better. A small free float means a lower supply of tradable shares.

# Institutions & Insider

**This is were things get really interesting.**¬†According to mandatory ownership filings, 13F/13G,¬†**Institutions own 74,90M out of 64.4M shares**. Yeah, Institutional ownership according to filings is at¬†**118%.** 

&#x200B;

[Fintel lists institutional ownership at 136.09&#37;, but a closer look into the official filings revealed 118.15&#37; to be correct. See for yourself https:\/\/fintel.io\/so\/us\/dtc](https://preview.redd.it/g6fd1mkoxz391.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc295ddc5270a4e3a8d29277588189edea42ff59)

# Thats Crazy & Bullish AF

Investor relations of several entities were baffled. The best explanation they offered alluded to the asynchronous nature of ownership filings. Its possible that some Institution already filed newly bought shares, while Institution that sold $DTC did not yet update their ownership. However in many years of researching Stocks I havnt seen anything like that. It is clear that institutions own nearly the complete float, leaving only an extremly small float on the table for the public and Short Hedgefunds.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1etiwcrxz391.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=8163709c69a8f2ef4080dbbdccea048f14406c60

**In general a high Institutional ownership is great, because:**

Shares which are owned by institutions are far less frequently traded. (low supply)

Institutions are less likely sell, especially now, because they bought since IPO at 17$ down to 4$ and will almost never sell for a loss. According to ownership filings the main bulk of shares were bought above 10$.

Institution like to buy shares under the radar, keeping share price low, until they are saturated. After this accumulation phase they let the stock price to go up, in order to sell for a profit.

Once the stock is ready to go up, it will be pushed by media entities, Jim Cramer etc.¬†**just like that:**

&#x200B;

**Insider:** 

The CEO and CFO of Solo Brand ($DTC) bought 90k shares for almost $500k during the last 7 trading days. Insider on average outperform the Stock Market and have more information about positive and negative news.

# Short Interest & FTD`s

I know many people on react allergic to those words and they are thrown around far too often, but the recent surge of GME/AMC shows that they should have a legit usage. Just listen to my arguments please before you bash this DD just on those merits.

# What is Short selling?

Hedgefunds can sell Shares short, this works by lending out shares from an entitiy to sell them on the free Market.¬†

In order to make a profit, they will have to buy those shares back at a later point.¬†

If the Share price is lower when they buy them back they can pocket the diffrence.

If the share prices goes up, they have to pay more then initially and make a loss.

**Example:**

Short Hedgefund A borrows 10 shares for 5$ each and sells them at the Market. Total: 50$ - After 3 month the share price went from 5$ to 3$. - SHF can buy 10 shares for 30$ and gives them back to the lender. - Short Hedgefund pockets 20$ diffrence.

**Short interest:**

With that out of the way lets look at the latest filing. On the 13th of May 3.21m shares were sold short. We can Assume they were bought above current share price, because $DTC was on a downward trend until recently. So right now they have to buy back the shares they borrowed in order to realize their profits. (increased demand)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s7uw80c4yz391.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=31f5f6479490adf1027c45724ec7b87764d55c7c

As of the latest official SEC filing 3.21 million shares of $DTC were sold short. $DTC\`s share price was in free fall since IPO, but recent developments point to a trend reversal, this offers a great entry point as short seller who close their position significantly drive up the share price.

&#x200B;

[See how the chart definitely broke through the yellow trend line - This can be seen as very bullish and a great entry point.](https://preview.redd.it/48wgrnh5yz391.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=667478337c7dd384854091437f5424148d7416e6)

The recent trend reversal puts pressure on SHF because their profits are melting. This means that up to 3.21million shares need to be bought in order to close out existing short positions.

Ortex, fintel Bloomberg etc. all have diffrent numbers for DTC\`s short interest because they messed up the count of institutional ownership. My observations clearly show a very tiny float with great bullish implications. (Very tiny supply.)

Oh Wednesday and Thursday a Volume of 81k and 116k respectively changed the share price by 3.4% and 3.7%. This points to an illiquid flow and is another indicator for a small float.

So if just a 80k-100k move the price by so much, can you imagine how much the price would move by 3.21m shares? Even better, because $DTC has a very low avr. Daily Volume, of ‚âà 600k shares, it will take several days for to get out of their obligations. As of now they are trying to double down and delay the inevitable - This tactic was commonly observed at other low liquidity short plays, but always fails at some point.

&#x200B;

[Solo Stove‚Ñ¢ made by Solo Brands.](https://preview.redd.it/v07zo0i7yz391.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9cf784bea914a8af8956da37da879b593845366)

Last but not least we have **485k Failure-to-deliver (FTD\`s)** on May 13th which is a bullish sign as well.

FTD\`s are shares that were bought, but not yet delivered by Market Makers. They have to be bought 35 days after the FTD-date. Next FTD data will be released at 15th of June, so we don't know if even more shares have to be recouped by Market Makers.

# Let me Sum it up - The perfect Storm is brewing. (TLDR)

**$DTC** has a **sustainable and scalable business model,** has increased its revenue by 126% in the last year and is Year-over-Year profitable. Independent analysts **expect $70m in earnings 2022** and beat their last two quarterly earnings estimations. We have **institutions buying up the free float** for months while keeping the share price low, in order to accumulate as much as possible. Look at current filings, it indicates, that they are **very few freely tradable shares available**. Leaving almost nothing on the Table for the public and short sellers. (Low Supply)

At the same time we have short sellers that have to buy back shares in order to profit, therefore hiking the share price and increasing demand. They find themselves at the point of trend reversal and due to low daily volume need **5-6 days to cover** their short positions. At some point those shares have to be bought back in order to realize profits and with sustainable growth year by year it is possible that $DTC saw its All-Time-Low recently.¬†

Thanks to the low share price and $DTC\`s profitability, the downside risk is quite managable right now, we have **88.8% positive Call option Volume** and a **nice gamma set** up is crystallizing.

Market Makers have to get at least **485k FTD\`s** from the free Market and most importantly, we have a huge army of **capable retail trader**, who know how to take advantage of Market Mechanics, that were used against them for decades. Because of Solo Brands ($DTC) recent run up many retail traders are on notice, the stock got a lot of positive news coverage, which is the best form of free advertisement.

As this DD is already far too long, nobody will ever reach this sentence, so I won't go into a technical chart-analysis, but I will shortly point out, that a breakup of a negative trend channel offers a great opportunity to enter, as a long lasting trend reversal seems to be likely.

**Full Disclosure:** I am long with 5k shares and some options. Always do your own research before investing and know your risk tolerance.

86,Crowdstrike ($CRWD) vs. Sentinel One ($S),2,v6z8fn,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v6z8fn/crowdstrike_crwd_vs_sentinel_one_s/,3,"Crowdstrike and Sentinel One both offer ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù solutions for end-point security. While both earnings reports were strong at first sight, worth diving deeper into the financials:

* **Crowdstrike** is growing at scale (**61%** revenue growth despite relatively large revenue base ‚Äî F22 $1.5bn and **F23E $2.2bn**) aided by comprehensive offering. The company has a solid **>30%+ FCF margin** and we expect it to generate $1bn+ in FCF in FY23 which provides a valuation support for the stock. Generally high growth companies trade on revenue multiples as opposed to FCF, as they do not generate cash flow, but Crowdstrike stands out on both metrics.
* **Sentinel One** is a relatively newer entrant in the endpoint security space growing rapidly **(>100%** revenue growth rate) albeit on a lower revenue basis ‚Äî F22 $200mm and **F23E $400mm.** The company reported a -73% operating margin and -$55mm FCF.

Two years ago I would have viewed both reports equally favorably. However, the era of ‚Äúfree money‚Äù has now ended, and consequently there is a strong premium assigned to companies that can demonstrate profitable growth at scale. 

Crowdstrike‚Äôs valuation will likely continue to look favorable on a FCF basis 1‚Äì3 years out. Conversely, for Sentinel One, investors will be looking at the run rate of cash burn (\~$100-$200mm) vs. the current cash balance ($1.2bn minus $375mm for Attivio). While there is still cushion for multiple years of negative FCF, investors today are warry of <5 year runways and potential to have to raise equity.

‚ÄúIn the absence of an obvious shock like a recession, companies are slow to guide down,‚Äù strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a note on Monday. ‚ÄúThis time should be no different, which means stocks can hang around current levels until the second-quarter earnings season when the next leg lower is likely to begin and end.‚Äù

Wilson has been among Wall Street‚Äôs most prominent bears and correctly predicted the latest market selloff, which was fueled by worries that a hawkish Federal Reserve would tip the economy into a recession. A strong jobs report on Friday further fanned those concerns and led the S&P 500 to its eighth weekly decline in nine.

Wilson forecasts the US benchmark will trade close to 3,400 by mid-to-late August, implying another 17% downside from its latest close. The largest 5% of S&P 500 stocks still trade at a 40% median premium to pre-pandemic levels compared with 17% for the broader index, he said.

‚ÄúThis potentially presents a downside scenario as well, where these stocks could be the final shoe to drop before we exit the current bear market,‚Äù the strategist wrote in the note.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks¬†are looking to open considerably higher this morning after we saw a somewhat choppy session on Friday. Last week the Labor Department confirmed a tight labor market with a better-than-expected jobs report for the month of May. We should also be getting Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for the month of May on Friday. Economists are forecasting the CPI to rise by 8.3% in May, the same rate as April. Both the strong jobs report and CPI data on Friday are giving the Fed the green light to hike rates more aggressively through the rest of 2022. Fed officials enter a blackout period this week, which limits how much FOMC committee members can speak publicly or give interviews, ahead of their next policy-setting meeting set for June 14-15. Most analysts are expecting a 50-basis point hike. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are up¬†\~1.1%, Dow Futures are¬†up \~80 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~1.5%. SPY resistance levels at 415, 416, and 420. Relevant support levels at 412, 410, 407, 405, 402.50, and 400. Crude oil is currently trading around $119 per barrel. I'll continue to watch energy stocks, even though most are hovering near their 52-week high. Renewable energy stocks are seeing some strength this morning as well. Chinese stocks are also seeing strength in premarket trading. Most are looking to test pretty significant resistance levels today, I'll be watching them closely. Meme stocks are still holding up, worth following today and through the rest of the week as well.¬†

* But there have been signs of regulatory easing from Beijing as China deals with economic fallout from the weekslong lockdown in Shanghai.
* The Journal report said authorities would lift a ban on Didi adding new users as early as next week and reinstate the company‚Äôs app in domestic app stores, citing people familiar with the matter.

I predicted a huge run up, that it happens so quickly is abit lucky. but with only 1million Volume this stock went up by 12% yesterday. So just imagine what beast this underdog will be once it flys above the Radar!

Over the last week Shortseller increased their positions by over 18%, yet the stock still gained traction and substantially increased in share Price, which is extremly bullish.

Every Short position they open, is a share they have to buy back at some point and shorting in a rising trend does put alot of pressure on Short Hedgefunds to buy out of their positions.

Besides that, $DTC has a much smaller float, then previously reported. Due to an error in the filings Institutions own over 100% of the Outstanding float. If this is true, it would be amazing, because how do you close 3.24 short positions with zero Free float?

I could have by now sold my position but I haven't because I seriously expect $DTC to reach 8-12$ in the next 3 month.

This is just my opinion. I left out alot of stuff which is even more bullish! If you like the stock. Do more research - check the DTC subreddit - but better hurry up It!",1654251152.0

# **Investors set their sights on upcoming inflation report as the bear market rally falters - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/investors-set-their-sights-on-upcoming-inflation-report-as-the-bear-market-rally-falters.html)**
*****
> The stock market may try to regain its footing in the next few sessions, even as a fresh inflation report looms large at the end of the week.
*****
> Stocks struggled to move forward in the past week. With Friday‚Äôs sell-off, the major indexes closed out the four-day period with losses. That was disappointing to investors looking for a similar upside to the week before Memorial Day during which the S&P 500 gained about 6.5%.
*****
> Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab chief investment strategist, said the market‚Äôs late May surge was likely the setup for more selling.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe type of rally like we saw last week and some of what it contained looks a little more typical of bear market rallies,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI still think you‚Äôre likely to get countertrend pops in some of the more speculative areas of the market. ... But I think very decidedly the low quality trade is in the rearview mirror. I think to do well in this environment you have to be value minded. Not value indexes, but valuation minded.‚Äù
*****
> While the S&P 500 briefly dipped into a bear market on May 20, it has not closed with a 20% decline from its high. However, Sonders said the current situation is the equivalent of a bear market, based on the sharp declines in individual stocks.
*****
> Sonders does not yet see signs that would indicate stocks could turn higher, though she says there is scope for more sharp rallies.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the sentiment environment is not universally bearish enough yet,‚Äù she said. She said sentiment and behavioral measures need to show extremes.
*****
> # Inflation peak?
> In the coming week, the economic calendar is relatively light. Consumer price index and consumer sentiment ‚Äî both released on Friday ‚Äî are the most important reports.
*****
> May‚Äôs CPI is expected to be just slightly cooler than April, and some economists are expecting it could confirm that inflation has peaked. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said year-over-year headline inflation is expected at 8.2%, just below April‚Äôs 8.3% pace.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf CPI comes in at or near consensus, I think investors could feel better,‚Äù he said. Hogan said the market‚Äôs late May breakout helped sentiment, even though stocks backtracked in the past week. ‚ÄúInvestors are in a more constructive place, and that can carry through if CPI is anywhere near consensus or better,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Headline inflation, including food and energy, was running at 8.5% in March, and the hope is that CPI will ease from here to half that level by year-end, Hogan said.
*****
> Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said CPI will be affected by the jump in gasoline prices in May. Used car prices and food costs could also be factors, she added.
*****
> ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs hoping for this peak inflation, but it may be more elusive and less of a peak than people would like it to be,‚Äù Swonk said.
*****
> Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that she does not see enough evidence inflation has peaked, and she is on board with multiple half point rate hikes to combat it. Fed officials are in a quiet period in the coming week, ahead of their meeting June 14.
*****
> Schwab‚Äôs Sonders said the market may be concerned in the short term about whether inflation has peaked.
*****
> ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not just whether we‚Äôre at the peak. It‚Äôs the speed at which we come down off that peak and ultimately to what level,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIs the [Federal Reserve] on a mission to get inflation down to the 2% target? Or are they going to feel comfortable with a 3% level. ... To me, it‚Äôs where does the plane land? Is the runway at a higher elevation than it was pre-pandemic?‚Äù
*****
> With the CPI Friday, traders say there is not much for the market to latch onto ahead of that report.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou have a whole week of price action, and as of right now, the price action seems ‚Äòglass half empty,‚Äô‚Äù said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.
*****
> Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said he is watching to see if the S&P 500 holds support at 4,073 and 4,000 below that. If not, it could drop back to its recent low of 3,810.
*****
> The S&P 500 closed Friday at 4,108, down 1.6% on the day and 1.2% for the week.
*****
> ‚ÄúTraders are losing faith in trying to put more risk on to catch more of an oversold bounce, or a bear market bounce. They‚Äôd almost not want to be involved because there‚Äôs too many potholes,‚Äù said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.
*****
> Redler said Tesla CEO Elon Musk soured sentiment, after reports that Musk told Tesla executives he had a ‚Äúsuper bad feeling‚Äù about the economy and needs to cut 10% of Tesla‚Äôs workforce. The comments followed closely on a remark from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that he is preparing for an economic hurricane.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have the poster child of risk saying they‚Äôre going to reduce their headcount by 10%. If they‚Äôre supposed to have a multiple for growth, and they reduce the headcount, then something has to give with valuation,‚Äù Redler said. Tesla shares fell 9% Friday.
*****
> # Earnings warnings
> While there are few earnings reports in the coming week, Hogan said companies could follow Microsoft‚Äôs lead and issue warnings. Microsoft lowered its guidance on revenues, citing an unfavorable currency impact. Salesforce also lowered revenue guidance due to currency.
*****
> ‚ÄúInvestors are at least looking through that. At least, it‚Äôs not a demand issue. They‚Äôre focusing on the higher dollar and what it might do to multinationals,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Campbell Soup and Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel‚Äôs, report quarterly results Wednesday. Signet Jewelers and DocuSign post earnings Thursday.
*****
> Sonders said weakening earnings and profit margin outlooks could trigger another leg down for the market.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe had the valuation re-rating by virtue of the weakness in the market, but we haven‚Äôt yet seen the weakness in forward expectations in earnings,‚Äù she said.
*****
> Sonders said the market rallies need to show better breadth, meaning a high percentage of stocks climbing together, before it begins to turn.
*****
> Another sign she is watching is the put/call ratio, which would need to be a higher level to reflect more pessimism. This ratio is used as a contrarian indicator. It is a measure of the number of put to call options. Put options bet that stock prices decline and a high number would suggest very negative sentiment in the market.

> # Will There Be A June Swoon? Maybe, But Maybe Not

> After a late month rally, we can say goodbye to the month of May, which now opens the door to June. Here‚Äôs the bad news, June is historically a weak month and it is actually the worst month of the year during a midterm year, down 1.8% on average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-1-1.png))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news though is the past 10 years, it has been a solid month, up 1.4% on average to rank as the fourth best month. But the past 20 years it has been weak (only September has been worse) and since 1950 only August, February, and September were worse.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-2-1.png))**

> ‚ÄúJune has something for everyone, as it is no doubt a very weak month historically, but the past decade it has been strong,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúStill, after the big bounce in late May, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if this recent strength continued into a potential summer rally.‚Äù

> Here are three reasons for optimism. First, after the huge gains last week, the 7 week losing streak for the S&P 500 Index is finally over. There had been only three prior 7 week losing streaks and twice (1970 and 1980) saw the S&P 500 up more than 33% a year later. On the other side though, the returns in 2001 weren‚Äôt very good as 9/11 and the recession hurt returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-3-5.31.22.png))**

> Second, the S&P 500 corrected 18.7% before the rally last week, which could be a good thing as looking at previous corrections between 10-20% showed gains of nearly 25% on average a year later and nearly 40% two years later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chart-4-5.31.22.png))**

> Lastly, huge gains like the 6.6% gain for the S&P 500 last week are usually a great sign for the bulls. Here are all the times it has gained more than 6% in a week (since 1950) and the future returns are very strong. Up 12.5% on average six months later and nearly 22% a year later on average is something that could have most bulls smiling after the rough start to 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/chart-5-5.31.22.png))**

> 2022 has been a rough year for most investors, but we do see better times ahead. Last week‚Äôs bottom and rally could be the start of brighter skies ahead for investors.

*****

> # Biggest Energy Names See Record Moves

> The Energy sector has been on an absolute tear over the pandemic period with a 273% gain since the pandemic lows in March 2020. During the overall market downturn of the past several months, it is the only cyclical sector to have managed to retain its uptrend as it has rallied over 60% year to date compared to a 13% decline for the S&P 500. Taking a look through our Chart Scanner tool, there is not too much variation in the charts of large-cap Energy stocks with strong uptrends across the board and many new multi-year highs as a result. Taking a look at two of the largest members who account for nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars in market cap, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are good examples. CVX has reached new all-time highs following its meteoric rise over the past couple of years while XOM has recovered most of the past decade's declines. Additionally, we would note that XOM has historically tended to be much larger than CVX, but the pandemic and the subsequent rally over the past couple of years have brought the two stocks' market caps much more closely in line with one another.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/053122-CVX-XOM-1a.png))**

> Both long-standing staples of the Energy sector, XOM and CVX are also notable in that they are both dividend aristocrats (a group of stocks that have now raised their dividend annually for 25 or more consecutive years). That means on top of massive capital gains, investors have also been rewarded handsomely with dividends. Even after these massive rallies, CVX still yields 3.25% and XOM pays an even better 3.67%. Taking this into account, the two-year runs including dividends that these stocks have been on are unlike anything observed since at least the early 1980s. Given the record two-year run we've seen in the Energy space, it's tough to get super bullish on this area of the market now. Remember, we saw an explosive move higher like this for other areas of the market earlier on in the post-pandemic era (think meme stocks, SPACs, high growth, etc.), but once the tide turned in late 2021, the downside reversal was just as extreme. Energy stocks have completely different fundamental risk profiles than aggressively valued Tech stocks, and ultimately their performance is mostly tied to the price of oil. That being said, investor psychology and herd mentality work the same regardless of the asset class.

> # Sentiment Swings Back to Optimism

> Sentiment has taken a big swing higher across surveys this week as the S&P 500 has experienced some upside mean reversion. The weekly AAII sentiment survey has seen bullish sentiment rebound from a sub-20% reading all the way back up to 32%. Relative to the historical average of 37.84%, that reading continues to show a depressed level of optimism for individual investors, but it is the strongest reading since the week of March 24th. As for the 12.2 percentage point jump in bullish sentiment week over week, it was the largest one week gain since the week of October 14th of last year when it rose 12.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bull.png))**

> As bullish sentiment surged, there was a massive 16.4 percentage point drop in bearish sentiment. That was the largest one week decline in the reading on pessimism since July 15, 2010 when it fell 19.27 percentage points. Now at 37.1%, bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the end of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Such a large decline in bearish sentiment in only one week has pretty much been unheard of in the post Financial Crisis years. Again, July 2010 was the last time bears fell by at least 15 percentage points and before that there are only about two dozen other occurrences without another instance in the previous three months. While it was a big decline, bearish sentiment remains fairly elevated at 37.1%, but that is inline with most other occurrences since the mid 2000s whereas bearish sentiment was generally lower from the occurrences before 2005.

> As for how the S&P 500 has tended to do following these massive bearish sentiment shifts, the S&P 500 has generally tended to move higher with outperformance versus the norm on a median basis one week and one month out. Although again performance is consistently positive, the size of gains have tended to be below or more inline with the norm three, six, and twelve months out from these occurrences.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/060222-AAII-Bear-Drop.png))**

> After the large moves in bulls and bears this week, sentiment continues to favor pessimism but to a much smaller degree than recent weeks as the bull bear spread narrowed to -5.1 points.

> # Was that the Low?

> Stocks rallied hard last week, as the S&P 500 Index broke a seven week losing streak in resounding fashion; its 6.6% gain was the best since November 2020. That strong response from equities, following one of the worst starts to the year ever, has many investors questioning, ‚ÄúWas that the low?‚Äù While we are certainly open to that possibility, today we will take a look at why the technical picture suggests volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

> First, let‚Äôs take a look at the technical set-up of the S&P 500. While stocks have bounced decisively off important support near 3800, the index is now faced with multiple levels of technical resistance, including broken support from the February and March lows, and the 50-day moving average at 4270. Given stocks steady series of lower highs and lower lows throughout 2022, it is important for us to see evidence that this trend has turned and can hold a higher high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blog-6.2.22.png))**

> Second, we remain skeptical that this market has truly bottomed without the capitulatory flush usually found at major market lows, as we discussed in last month‚Äôs Weekly Market Commentary. Nothing in markets has to happen, but whether it is put/call ratios, a stubbornly low VIX (a measure of implied market volatility based on options prices), or even just the fact that several of the nongrowth sectors arguably remain rangebound from 2021 and haven‚Äôt corrected, it would be highly unusual for us to see such a major market low without genuine signs of investor panic and indiscriminate selling. Of the five major signs of panic that we track and are often found at major market bottoms, only one has triggered so far this year in contrast to a minimum of 3 that have been found at recent lows in March 2020, the fall of 2015, late 2011 and the Great Financial Crisis in 2008-2009.

> Finally, while we are inching closer, we remain in the seasonally weak part of the year and a May low would still be on the early side of the average low in a midterm year. Looking at all the midterm years going back to 1950, only two have seen their yearly low before May 19, when the S&P 500 made its closing low two weeks ago. We would note though, that the depth of this correction is almost exactly in line with the average mid-term year pullback. And regardless of when we make that bottom, as the chart below shows, the gains a year after the low have been substantial with a more than 30% average return and only one occurrence falling short of a double digit gain.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chart-6.2.22.png))**

> ‚ÄúWe are anything but market pessimists,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Technical Market Strategist Scott Brown. ‚ÄúIn fact, we believe there will be substantial opportunity in stocks on the other side of this volatility and likely in the second half of the year. However, outside of this recent rally, very little about this market has changed from a technical standpoint and that makes us wary of calling the all-clear. We believe a slight lean towards defensive sectors and away from the growth-oriented areas of this market still make sense‚Äù.

> LPL Research‚Äôs Strategic and Tactical Asset Allocation Committee is most positive on healthcare and real estate and is becoming increasingly positive on energy. Within growth sectors, we are most negative on communication services and consumer discretionary and also believe the industrials sector is likely to underperform.

> # Revisiting The 50/50 Club

> Amidst all of the craziness in growth/meme stocks in early 2021, we took a look at the Russell 3000 stocks that were both 50%+ off their 52 week highs and still 50%+ above their 52 week lows to show some of the most volatile names in the market last May. Today, we are revisiting that club to show some of the growth names that have gotten hammered since last May but have recovered substantially off of their lows recently. Much of this craziness is resembled through Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund (ARKK), which is now about 20% above its lows on 5/11 but still 67% off its 52 week high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/06/ARKK-Performance-Chart-060322-2.png))**

> Currently, there are 33 Russell 3,000 stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion that are 50%+ below their 52 week highs and 50%+ above their 52 week lows. These 33 stocks are outlined below, and every single one of them are still below their 200-day moving averages. However, only 12 are below their 50-DMAs. The average stock on this list is 67.3% off its 52 week highs (median: 65.4%) and 68.9% above its 52 week low (median: 60.6%).

> There are a few notable names on this list, including the new-to-market EV manufacturer Rivian (RIVN), the famed meme stock GameStop (GME), the Metaverse Index component Unity Software (U), the digital platform engineering company EPAM Software (EPAM), and the EV charging station company ChargePoint (CHPT). CHPT is up 63% from its lows on May 11th. EPAM has already doubled since its lows in March. While it may not seem like much if you own the shares a lot higher, these names have recently seen massive bounces off of their lows.

> # Lackluster June Recent 21-Year Seasonal Chart

> June recorded average losses for DJIA & S&P 500 the last 21 years. NASDAQ and Russell 2K have fared better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. Then stocks drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon the index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small caps.

> Over the last 51 years June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking fifth best with a 1.0% average gain, up 29 of 51 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.9% in the month since 1979.

> In midterm years since 1950, June ranks no better than eleventh. June is the worst DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 month in midterm years. Average losses range from 1.5% by Russell 1000 to 1.8% from S&P 500. Of the five indexes, none has a winning track record in June. DJIA and S&P 500 have declined more than they have risen.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks¬†are looking to open lower this morning after we saw some more strength in the market yesterday.¬†If you check SPY's daily chart, yesterday's volume was lower than both Wednesday and Thursday's sessions. We'll see how things look closer to open, but it figures to be a volatile day. I'll be watching support levels, looking for further weakness. TSLA is down over 4% after reports of the company planning on laying off 10% of its staff and freezing hiring worldwide. Musk said he had a ‚Äúsuper bad feeling‚Äù about the economy. This comes just days after JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of a ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù coming to the US economy. We should be getting the May jobs report from the Labor Department sometime this morning. The Fed has been calling for a tighter job market, and it‚Äôs looking likely that that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôll get. This may sound like good news, but it could actually be bad news for the market, as it gives the Federal Reserve the green light to hike rates more aggressively in the future. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are down¬†\~70 basis points, Dow Futures are¬†down \~50 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \~1.1%. SPY resistance levels at 416 and 420, relevant support levels at 412, 410, 407, 405, 404, and 400. Crude oil continues to hold up well, currently trading a bit under $118 per barrel. Energy stocks are mixed in premarket; worth following if crude oil shows strength relative to the rest of the market. Meme stocks are still worth keeping an eye on. GME had a solid day yesterday, I'll be watching to see if that momentum continues today.¬†

Block, Inc. will work with Apple Inc (AAPL) to integrate Square payments with ""Tap to Pay"" feature on iPhones and launch it later this year, the fintech company said on Thursday.

The San Francisco-based company's shares rose 7% on the news.

The company said sellers would be able to accept in-person contactless payments with only their iPhone and a Square Point-of-Sales (POS) app, without the need for additional hardware.

Block said an Early Access Program will help sellers test the integration with iPhones this summer.

Apple had earlier said its ""Tap to Pay"" feature would launch later this year, with Stripe and Shopify Point [SHOP.TO](https://SHOP.TO) being the first to offer the feature to business customers in the United States.

The iPhone-maker has been beefing up its fintech services. It launched its own credit card with Goldman Sachs GS.N in 2019 and is reportedly working on a ""buy now, pay later"" service.

145,"Why would IBM sell shares of its spin-off company, Kyndryll?",0,v49afp,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v49afp/why_would_ibm_sell_shares_of_its_spinoff_company/,4,"IBM announced that its going to completely offload shares of its spin-off company, Kyndryll. Seems like bad timing after the price of the spin-off has already dropped significantly due to market conditions. 

Isn‚Äôt this a really inefficient way to sell growth assets? It seems weird to go through all the trouble of a spin-off only to sell your entire holding. Can someone explain the reasoning? Thanks

The Barron‚Äôs article is as follows: 
IBM has swapped half of its nearly 20% stake in the managed IT services firm Kyndryl to Goldman Sachs, securities filings show. 

As part of the IBM (ticker: IBM) spinoff of Kyndryl (KD) completed last November, Big Blue held on to a 19.9% stake, but promised to sell it within 12 months of the completion of the spin. 

Kyndryl shares have struggled mightily in the public market -- the stock has fallen by more than 50% since closing the first day of trading at $26.38. 

There are several reasons for the weak performance, which go beyond the broad selloff in tech shares. Kyndryl is working to turn around its business, but expects shrinking revenue until fiscal year 2025. 

Also, while investors like IBM shares in part for its 4.7% dividend yield, Kyndryl isn't paying any dividend, which made it either impossible or unattractive for some IBM holders to keep their Kyndryl stake. 

Kyndryl also has faced the overhang from the pending sale of IBM's stake. But the unwinding of that position is now making some progress. 

In a recent filing with the SEC, IBM disclosed that it has swapped half of its stake, about 22.3 million shares, along with $46 million in cash, to Goldman Sachs, in exchange for the extinguishment of a $357 million short-term credit facility. Goldman, in turn, filed with the SEC to disclose the position, and has since sold a small portion of the shares. 

""Consistent with our stated intentions at the time of the separation of Kyndryl, IBM has begun to sell its retained stake in Kyndryl,"" IBM confirmed in a statement. ""This initial transaction addresses half of our holdings. It remains IBM's intention to sell its remaining stake within 12 months of the November 3, 2021 Kyndryl separation date."" 

It could take some time for the market to completely absorb the shares held by IBM, and now Goldman. Together, they total close to 45 million shares, or more than 20 days of average trading volume in Kyndryl shares",1654291051.0

Bitcoin has a catalyst every 4 years called the halving.  That‚Äôs when the reward for minor‚Äôs transactions are cut in half and so far every time that‚Äôs caused a supply shock.

After every bull run bitcoin bottomed out roughly a year after the top.   IF BTC follows this pattern that would put it at roughly 12,000 around November this year.  

The next halving is in 2024 and typically the bull run takes place a year after.  Mind you this is all speculation and past performance doesn‚Äôt guarantee future returns.   But if Bitcoin gets down to that‚Äôs price range near the end of the year I will slowly start to accumulate and look to take profits in 2025 when everyone and their neighbour is talking about BItcoin again.

Since QE and QT are relatively newer concepts (invented in Japan in 2001 and adopted in the US in 2008), I feel like I haven't seen any strategies that hinge on this process. But it very well could be the most important factor in determining stock market bull and bear cycles.

My investigation... what would your return be if you invested in TQQQ at the beginning of every QE period and sold when QE ends for that period. You would only buy back in when QE started back up, which could mean you sit on the sidelines for long periods of time. Since TQQQ is a triple leveraged asset, you are squeezing the most out of every QE induced bull market, while potentially sidestepping all QT induced bear market... in theory.

From what I can tell, QE has happened multiple times US:

~~QE1: December 2008 to March 2010 (difficult to determine because TQQQ was not around, but est. Total Return 75%)~~

~~QE2: November 2010 to June 2011 (Total Return 25.86%)~~

~~QE3 and Operation Twist: September 2011 to December 2012 (Total Return 35.45%)~~

~~QE4: January 2013 to October 2014 (Total Return 99.97%)~~

~~QE 2020: March 2020 to March 2022 (Total Return 70%)~~

TLDR - From what I can tell, every QE event kicked off a nice bull run. TQQQ lets you capitalize on these Fed induced cycles by squeezing more out of the market. Invest immediately after the Fed indicates they are starting QE, and sell when the Fed ends QE. At that point, sit on the sidelines and wait until they start QE back up again. If you started this process with $100,000 at the start of 2008 and stuck to this program, you would have roughly $1,014,106.

**EDIT - I had some incorrect math up top. Actual returns here:**

QE1: December 2008 to March 2010 (difficult to determine because TQQQ was not around, but est. Total Return 200%)

QE2: November 2010 to June 2011 (Total Return 25.86%)

QE3 and Operation Twist: September 2011 to December 2012 (Total Return 49.86%)

QE4: January 2013 to October 2014 (Total Return 224.49%)

QE 2020: March 2020 to March 2022 (Total Return 302.23%)

So $100,000 with this program would've results in $2,559,399. ",1654107278.0

It‚Äôs my understanding money is a technology that allows us to plan for the future which brings lots of advantages to the human race as a whole. this only applies when the money is ‚Äòhard‚Äô though. 

We currently operate on the fiat standard now where our money is no longer hard. Other words anyone who tries to save money in a bank for example is now actually loosing money as the governments artificially increase the money supply by ‚Äòprinting‚Äô more money. 

So if a person wants to save Money now, their only option is to invest in some form or another to beat inflation. Almost all personal finance advice I‚Äôve seen nowadays is to dollar cost average at least part of your portfolio in large index funds (401ks etc.). 2 companies have a monopoly on the assets in the stock market regular people invest in - blackrck and vanguard. These companies also work closely with the federal reserve - the establishment responsible for printing money. 

In the great reset ‚Äòyou will own nothing and you will be happy‚Äô I‚Äôve seen speculation those 2 companies will buy up everything (land, houses etc.) to create a ‚Äòpopulation of renters‚Äô - hence owning nothing.

My question is, is investing in the stock market implicitly participating in a ‚Äògame‚Äô we can never win: 

 (working for money that can‚Äôt be saved, therefore has to be invested, said invested money makes the richest/most powerful richer - these people work closely with the  ‚Äòprinters‚Äô of the money, this presumingly symbiotic relationship means money continues to be printed, which keeps us poor/constantly working - makes the rich richer - cycle repeats) 

And is there anything we can do about it? Any realistic alternative to stock market investing for trying to safeguard your future? 

Or is it just a law of nature where a small group of powerful people ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô a population - you just have to strive to live in a society where the control isn‚Äôt too drastic?",1654181305.0

188,Carvana the next BUST,12,v2eyub,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v2eyub/carvana_the_next_bust/,17,"Let me start by saying running a used car dealership is not that simple. Margins are thin. Competition is very strong. Used car dealerships, especially a company like CVNA, have tight margins to start. From 10% to 15% gross margin is a fair assessment.  
So let‚Äôs dive in and look at Carvana‚Äôs (CVNA)  
Popularity Carvana took to the skies in 2021 as buying from home took root during covid. Yes, a percentage of the population will continue to buy online; but another percent will go back to the lot, drive the car and buy the old-fashioned way.  
So what could be fueling this issue? A few things to consider are: ‚Ä¢higher interest rates ‚Ä¢lower disposable income ‚Ä¢lack of incentive checks  
‚Ä¢and an economic slowdown

Let‚Äôs look at the high level financials. Since 2018 CVNA has managed to average 13% in gross margins. Unfortunately for shareholders, management has spent an average 19.4% in SG&A cost (sales, general and administrative expenses). If we subtract 19.4% from 13%, we have a simple explanation for the continuing net loss (since 2018) Additionally, CVNA inventory went from $762m in Dec 2019 (before covid) to $3.3b last quarter (Q1 2022)  
The problem here is that they are sitting on a massive overpriced inventory (remember when dealers were paying more for your 2-year-old car than you paid for it when it was new?) Those cars are, in part, sitting at the CVNA Balance Sheet. To make matters worst, the sales of cars in general are dropping aggressively and prices with it. I estimate CVNA has $1.0 billion in additional losses that will have to be ‚Äúflush through‚Äù the P&L in the next 12 to 18 months. The concern here is simple: They don‚Äôt have that money in the balance sheet to weather the storm, and borrowing or issuing stock will further dilute the value of the stock. So, if management has not demonstrated the skills necessary to deliver a profit during a strong economy with excess liquidity and super-low interest rates, how will they weather a recession? How will they run a company in a turnaround environment?  
For the previous four years, CVNA has accumulated approximately $500m in a net loss. My estimate is that in the next 12 to 18 months, they will add twice as much to that existing loss.

So, in summary, Carvana management has not yet demonstrated the skills to manage a company in a crisis. They have an estimated $1.0b in losses to swallow in the next 12 to 18 months with an aging and grossly overpriced inventory.  
Their issues are: ‚Ä¢a financial market that is not very friendly, ‚Ä¢diminishing interest in their product ‚Ä¢Increasing interest rate ‚Ä¢decreasing demand ‚Ä¢limited cash on hand ‚Ä¢and an ugly recession looming around the corner To top all that, the Short interest has grown by 60% in the last month (now seating at over 16%).  
In my opinion, CVNA is in serious trouble. I am brave enough to say this company will not survive if we enter into a full recession. It‚Äôs the perfect storm; or should I say, a tornado.

Disclaimer. I am not a financial advisor. I don't have an interest in CVNA. Do your own research and make your own decision. I am not here telling anyone what to do. This post only reflects my personal opinion. Yes I intend to short in the future and may take a position in the next few days.",1654083650.0

CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer told investors on Tuesday that some stocks have fallen so far from their highs that they will inevitably rally.

‚ÄúWhile they may stay losers, the bottom line is they‚Äôve fallen so darn far that I think they‚Äôve become metaphors for a whole host of stocks that are now ready to rally because they‚Äôve got nowhere else to go but up,‚Äù the ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host said.

Calling several tech giants ‚Äúcolossal losers,‚Äù Cramer pinpointed Amazon, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet ‚Äî three members of his now-discarded FAANG acronym ‚Äî as names that will rebound. The other FAANG companies include Apple and Netflix.

Here‚Äôs why Cramer believes those three ‚Äòlosers‚Äô will rally:

Cramer said that he believes the company could boost its stock valuation if it culls warehouses and workers, takes a more aggressive approach to retail advertising and keeps its Amazon Web Services robust. 

‚ÄúAmazon is a company that could earn $82 a share in 2024. Now, before you laugh about me using 2024 estimates, remember that 2022 is almost half over,‚Äù he said.

Cramer said that he has faith in Zuckerberg‚Äôs vision for the metaverse, noting that other leaders, including Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang, are also betting big on it.

At this stage this is 0% risk since I have my SL above my entry price at $2,150 which in the worst scenario I will make around $500... I won't complain.

If the price continues going up, I will move the SL a bit more.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks¬†are looking to open a bit lower to start the new week. After finally snapping the 7-week losing streak, it remains to be seen whether this rally will continue or if it is simply another bounce on the way down. If you check out SPY's weekly chart, you'll see that last week's volume was less than each of the previous 5 red weeks. This week figures to be lower volume as well because of the short week, but I'll be watching resistance levels closely, as volume trends make me think we'll be rejecting resistance levels at some point this week. Key resistance level for SPY at 430. At the time of writing, S&P Futures are down¬†\~70 basis points, Dow Futures are¬†up \~70 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are up \~45 basis points. SPY support levels at 412, 410, 406, 404, and 400. Relevant resistance levels at 414, 415, 420, 425, and 430. Crude oil is breaking out, currently trading a bit under $119 per barrel. Good to see the breakout as I've been saying this for a few weeks now. Energy stocks are seeing strength in premarket trading and will be worth following today and through the rest of the week. Crude oil could continue its strength given the recent agreement by EU leaders to stop purchases of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia. Chinese stocks are also seeing strength after reports of Chinese authorities ending the two-month COVID lockdown; worth following today as well.¬†Meme stocks also started heating up last week, worth following to see if the momentum continues.¬†

210,Can someone please ELIF how compound returns and %‚Äôs work?,11,v1jq14,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v1jq14/can_someone_please_elif_how_compound_returns_and/,20,"I‚Äôm a complete beginner so please bare with me. 

How is the average annual return number calculated? 

I hear it‚Äôs been roughly 10% on average, historically 


Are people making a lot more than I am thinking? As far as why compound interest is so amazing‚Ä¶


The average of a number is adding them all up, then dividing that number by the number of them added up. 

As a quick example‚Ä¶

The numbers 2,3 and 4. The average is three. 2+3+4 is 9, then divided by 3=3. 

Is the market open 5 days per week, roughly? Going up or down a % each day? 


The number 1 as an example. By itself the average is 1 since it‚Äôs just one number. How does this work if say the market goes up 1% for five days in a row? That would be an average of 1%, despite happening five days in a row.

$1,000 for example. 

If it gains 1% that‚Äôs $1,010. 

Then the next day if $1,010 gains 1% the new balance is $1,020.10 correct?  Then etc, gaining more than $10 each day despite the average being 1%

For a week, say it gains 1% per day. When the week is over, if someone says it gained 1% this week, wouldn‚Äôt that mean $1000 is now $1,010? Yet the total would be higher than $1,010 since it gained 1% each day?

This happens so many days out of a whole year‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sort of confusing myself but does anyone see what I mean? 

Like if hypothetically it gained 1% each day of the year the market is open, the average is 1% for the year, but obviously whatever you put in, you‚Äôd have way more than 1% of what you put in


Can someone explain this? As I‚Äôm sure I didn‚Äôt even word this the best possible way",1653977707.0

Currently, I have 208 shares of Tesla. I used to have more index funds but I converted most of it to Tesla stocks. In business school I was taught the importance of diversification but I felt like Tesla is worth the risk. Many people want to retire to early and FIRE, but I'm not one of them. I'm totally okay with working a few more decades. As a matter of fact, I don't like sitting around doing nothing so I need something to do. I know that there is a chance that I could lose almost everything if the company goes bankrupt, even if the chance is pretty small. I know that money isn't everything in life so I will be totally okay even if Tesla stocks goes to $0 per share forever. On the flip side, if Tesla stock does well I could be a millionaire in just a few years and maybe even multi-millionaire one day. I plan to hold my shares until late 2040s or even 2050s.

Investors got a reprieve from a painful sell-off as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rallied to close their best weeks since November 2020.

The Dow jumped 575.77 points, or nearly 1.8%, to 33,212.96. The S&P 500 rose about 2.5% to 4,158.24. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, helped by strong earnings from software companies and a fall in the 10-year Treasury yield. It was ended the day up 3.3% to reach 12,131.13.

All three of the major averages closed the week higher. The Dow finished up 6.2% for the week and snapped its longest losing streak, eight weeks, since 1923. The S&P 500 is 6.5% higher and the Nasdaq is up 6.8% on the week. Both indexes ended seven-week losing streaks. A chunk of the week‚Äôs gains came Thursday and Friday, when all three of the averages rallied as strong retail earnings and a slowing inflation report lifted sentiment.

Hello fellow retards.

&amp;#x200B;

So. Many of you degenerate crayon eaters haven't ever gotten laid - well mostly because you are piss poor,  live in your mother's basements, and gamble all your money away. At least according to JC.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I am telling you that there is a chance!

(edit: &lt;--- it's okay to rape?)

But, he continued: ""In the physical world, as well as the internet, people shout and swear and do all kinds of unpleasant things that aren't prohibited by law, and they harass and attack people in ways that are. The metaverse will be no different. People who want to misuse technologies will always find ways to do it.""

(\^Definitely might be okay to rape, lol wtf)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I know this doesn't count as real sex, but if people can spend real money on their avatars wearing digital items in computer games, I guess people would spend money as well on their avatars getting laid.

I had no idea that this was even possible untill I stumbled upon the article, but this is super bullish for Zuckerman. He might end up being the largest digital pimp-daddy during this decade.

234,Portfolio Sinking? Look at $BDRY,0,v172cs,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v172cs/portfolio_sinking_look_at_bdry/,1,"The Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF, $BDRY, is  an ETF designed to reflect the daily price movements of the near-dated dry bulk freight futures. $BDRY offers investors unlevered exposure to dry bulk freight without the need for a futures account. The Fund provides transparency to investors by listing all its holdings daily, and is designed to reduce the effects of rolling contracts by using a laddered strategy to buy contracts while letting existing positions expire and settle in cash.

Now, what is of interest with $BDRY is most of the futures contracts used in the development of the the ETF holdings are between one and four months from expiring.  This is important because shipping is an extremely seasonal industry.  When we look back on the ETF‚Äôs performance, we see this clearly.  June through October has historically rewarded bulls of this industry as shipping gears up for the busy holiday season, which creates excess demand.  Normally December is a very busy shipping time, and following the holidays shipping historically has slowed back down.  Since this ETF uses futures contracts, we see December is priced in fully during the September to November timeframe.  

From a technical perspective, $BDRY has made multiple bottoms recently around the $20 mark, while currently sitting very close to this number at $21.48.  If this support breaks, the ETF could certainly decrease quickly in price.  This would take major market dynamics shifting, and we believe it is more probable that the costs for shipping increase over the next few months.  Oil is projected to continue its rise, which will add cost to the shipping contracts.  The seasonality of the dry shipping industry of course also play into the bullish factor.  Finally, when we consider the geopolitical dynamics of the current world (such as Iran seizing ships and threatening more in the Persian Gulf), all engines seem to be powering up for a run.

Hi,

I found this quick simple tool and wanted to share it. Not sure if it's useful to anybody (especially an analyst).

This URL loads 2 years of trading data for any given ticker, it uses a public API to fetch the data, this data currently includes fields like ""time"", ""open"", ""close"", ""high"", ""low"", ""volume"", on this page, you could slice/dice, filter, transform and do some storytelling for sharing.

The URL template looks like this¬†[https://columns.ai/visual/75493b96-b7e3-42df-b9cf-6f6c01510851?share&StockSymbol=SQ](https://columns.ai/visual/75493b96-b7e3-42df-b9cf-6f6c01510851?share&StockSymbol=SQ)¬†using ""SQ"" for example.

Interestingly, if you want to embed this tool to other sites, you can simply append the ""&headless"" parameter in the URL.

For example, this is¬†[a graph](https://columns.ai/snap/9RUPe292ugLIZP?share&StockSymbol=SQ)¬†that I shared with one of my friends working in Block/Square.

(NASDAQ:OTLK) insiders filled their treasuries with US$557k worth of stock over last year",2,v0imvi,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v0imvi/otlk_bullish_outlook_therapeutics_inc_nasdaqotlk/,5,"Usually, when one insider buys stock, it might not be a monumental event. But **when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OTLK), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.**

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

**Outlook Therapeutics Insider Transactions Over The Last Year**

In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Kurt Hilzinger bought US$257k worth of shares at a price of US$1.49 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$1.57 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Outlook Therapeutics share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.

Outlook Therapeutics insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!

Outlook Therapeutics is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.

**Outlook Therapeutics Insiders Bought Stock Recently**

Over the last quarter, Outlook Therapeutics insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. We can see that Independent Director Kurt Hilzinger paid US$117k for shares in the company. No-one sold. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.

**Insider Ownership**

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 7.9% of Outlook Therapeutics shares, worth about US$28m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.

**So What Do The Outlook Therapeutics Insider Transactions Indicate?**

It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Insiders likely see value in Outlook Therapeutics shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Outlook Therapeutics (including 2 which make us uncomfortable).

Of course Outlook Therapeutics may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.

For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.

‚ÄúGiven  the pick up in stresses, we raise our FY22 China Property HY default  rate forecast to 31.6% (from 19.0% previously), which was our previous  bear case assumption"" - Goldman Sachs

‚ÄúThe  key problem remains the overall decline in sales and prices, which is  creating an annualized shortfall in developers‚Äô revenue of around 3%-4%  of GDP compared with last year. Interest rate cuts may help at the  margin, but only after the threat of lockdowns is lifted, and probably  only in major cities as well.‚Äù - Logan H. Wright, partner and general  director, China Markets Research, Rhodium Group

Credit  to Chinese businesses has increased even faster, supporting GDP growth,  but the resulting leverage in the corporate sector makes it  increasingly vulnerable to shocks. Nonfinancial business credit in China  has reached about 160 percent of GDP.

Corporate  indebtedness has become particularly high in China‚Äôs real estate  sector‚Äîwhich has been a key engine of China‚Äôs rapid growth.  n the past  few years, the Chinese government has tightened regulation of property  markets, including the imposition of new constraints on home purchases,  banks‚Äô ... mortgage lending in some markets. Not long after these  initiatives were implemented, property sales slowed.

Chinese  property developers in the offshore dollar market are trading at  increasingly distressed levels. Although the Chinese government has  managed to contain its effects so far, a significant worsening of the  downturn in property markets could affect China‚Äôs fin. system

**Ticker:** GOEV

**Market Cap:** $800mm

**Share Price** = $3.55 (5/27/2022 AH)
__________________
**TL/DR:** Canoo/$GOEV is severely undervalued for the following reasons. 

**1)** The market is severely underestimating Canoo‚Äôs ability to raise non-dilutive capital

**2)** Because of #1, The market is severely underestimating Canoo‚Äôs future revenue. With only organic marketing, the company has 17,500 preorders equating to 750 Mil in revenue (with a market cap of only $800mm as of 5/27/2022) this does not include fleet orders.

**3)** Canoo is changing the way vehicles are sold in a way no other manufacturer has grasped. Canoo is evolving what it means to purchase a vehicle

**4)** Constant Media FUD from misleading(or, at the very least, uneducated) reporters is surely putting pressure on Canoo‚Äôs stock

**5)** Major short interest in Canoo
__________________
Hello. Here is my DD on why Canoo ($GOEV) is severely undervalued. 

Some background context, a lot of the EV startups have been hammered, some more then others, due to the general downturn in the market. They have also been hammered specifically due to the question of funding.. how are these startups going to get the cash to realize their goals?
__________________
**Section #1 - Speculating on Funding**
__________________

If you have been following the Canoo story, listening to the ER's, reading transcripts of anything and everything their CEO has talked about, their philosophy on funding has been to access low amounts of funding when necessary to bridge gaps between milestones which will set up the company to access more advantageous funding options in the future. Please bare with me on some of the background info, as it's important to get the full idea if you have not been following Canoo.


Quick stats on Canoo's Financials As of Q1. March 31 2022

**A. Cash on Hand** - Approx $100MM

**B. Q1 Quarterly Loss** - Approx $120MM

**C. Q2 2022 Cash Spend Guidance**

$100 Million in Operating Expenses

$100 Million in Capex. Total $200 Million

**D LT Debt** - $0

**Current Funding Commitments** 

$600MM total in accessible capital via stock sales with the following transaction completed.

**1)** $50MM equity purchase agreement with AFV (A fund ran by CEO Tony Aquila.
13.6 Million Shares @ purchase price of $3.65) This sale has gone through as of May 18th, diluting shareholders approximately 5.75%. Canoo now has $150MM In liquidity. Assuming another $120MM Spend in Q2, like Q1, the company has runway for the Q2 with, presumably, no need to dilute further.

The remaining $550MM in accessible capital will be tapped on a cash need basis..

**2)** SEPA with Yorkville Capital for $250 Million. Details on the SEPA..

‚ÄúPursuant to the SEPA, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville up to $250,000,000 of its shares of Common Stock, at the Company‚Äôs request any time during the 36 months following the execution of the SEPA. An ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù may be for a number of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of up to $50,000,000‚Äù The SEPA Cannot be used to exceed **19.9%** of the companies stock. 

So we are looking at a worst case scenario of 20% further dilution from the SEPA 

**3)** Shelf Offering of $300 Million. 

Essentially, the company could, in a worst case scenario (If the stock is valued poorly), sell shares on the open market up to $300 million in proceeds from time to time for further funding as needed.

**Speculative Funding**

Now for the fun part...

I believe Canoo will not need to tap their confirmed dilutive funding options to an extent that will be detrimental to current stockholders. And if they do, will be in tranches of 50 million (SEPA), preferably at a higher stock price with improving market conditions. Most growing companies issue shares from time to time for growth. 

However, I believe the recent funding commitments were inked to:

**A)** Give Canoo a life vest / emergency last resort funding to not go bankrupt and more importantly,

**B)** bridge milestones to get Canoo into a position to access NON dilutive funding. 

For example, they already tapped $50 million (5.75% dilution) bringing liquidity to Approx $150 Million. This will buy them another quarter of milestone achievements and progress and time to ink non-dilutive funding. Which leads me to what I believe is truly in the cards for Canoo..potential non dilutive funding. The past few ER's, CEO Tony Aquila has stated they are focusing a lot on securing non dilutive financing.

Ranked from the least cost effective to the most cost effective...

**1) Conventional unsecured debt & credit lines**

Banks might be willing to give Canoo Unsecured loans & credit lines at any moment. These loans would probably be costly for a startup. The loans would probably become less costly overtime as Canoo hits milestones (Production, and actually delivering cars for revenue) IMO Canoo can access other more cost effective non-dilutive funding before this option as speculated below

**2) Green Energy Convertible Bonds**

See [Fisker's PR on their sale of Green Bonds. $FSR](https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-Inc.-Announces-600000000-Green-Convertible-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) and [Arrival's PR on their sale of Green Bonds. $ARVL](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/19/2337948/0/en/Arrival-Announces-Pricing-and-Upsize-of-Offering-of-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-due-2026.html)

Canoo could tap this option, here are some details on what green bonds [are](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/green-bonds#:~:text=A%20green%20bond%20is%20a,clean%20transportation%20and%20sustainable%20forestry.)

**3) Asset Backed Secured Loans**

Loans on the their manufacturing equipment, Gamma vehicles, sourced inventory for vehicle parts, etc. 

For example, if Canoo were to use $150 million on manufacturing equipment and parts, (Obviously this number will be higher, just an example) the company could ink a deal with a bank for another $100-150 million, with said assets as the collateral.

**4) Opportunity Zones.**

Great writeup and interview about what an [opportunity zone](https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2019/03/30/what-you-need-to-know-about-opportunity-zones/?sh=db3ae3e6ae23) is. OZ‚Äôs are meant to encourage investment in low-income communities, allowing for preferential tax treatment.

How does this tie in with Canoo? Well, their Oklahoma factory is on **Cherokee nation land**, and this makes it an opportunity zone that Canoo can raise capital with this tax advantaged funding. 

Tony has been quoted in ER‚Äôs, transcripts, various sources talking about how he is excited to partner with the Cherokee nation and employ natives at Canoo factories. When asked by Reuters, Aquila did not specify exactly how much Canoo would [seek to raise](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canoo-production-starts-could-slip-ceo-remains-confident-funding-2022-05-18/) from opportunity zones. 

This unique way to raise funds is something that has me really excited for Canoo.

**5) Department of Energy** [ATVM Loan](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program)

IMO, the best case scenario for Canoo. This federal low interest, long term maturity loan would be the cherry on the top of this story. 

Now I don‚Äôt have a source on this, as I inferred it from another redditor. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/tkba0p/financing_discussion/) But apparently Roth Capital (Analyst Craig Irwin) issued a note at the 34th annual roth conference (march13th 2022) in discussion with a few Canoo Execs, that says Irwin believes the company is in the late stages of securing an ATVM DoE loan. 

Historically, these loans have been in the hundreds of millions to billions. For example, Tesla, Ford, and Nissan were granted ATVM loans totaling $8 Billion combined between the 3 OEMs. 

Startups like [Lordstown Motors](https://www.lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-to-next-stage-in-department-of-energy-s-advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program-application) and [Mullen Automotive](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/05/02/2433232/0/en/Mullen-Automotive-Files-U-S-Department-of-Energy-ATVM-Loan-Application-for-Mullen-ONE-EV-Cargo-Van-Program.html) have publicly announced that they have applied for the ATVM Loan. 

Canoo has a philosophy of ""Big news or no news"" Tony has been quoted saying this about 5+ times in various ER's. 

Canoo really does give off a vibe of secrecy if you have been following them since their Pre IPO days in late 2020 (Specifically when Aquila became CEO / Chariman shortly after IPO)

As to why Canoo has not announced this ATVM application publicly? Imo it's just something that isn't a guarantee and really hits HARD if it actually happens. A PR of an ATVM Loan approval would, in my opinion, could absolutely cause a short closing event. It would be so drastically unexpected. 

Aquila recently said in an [interview last week](https://jalopnik.com/canoo-ceo-reports-of-our-death-are-greatly-exaggerated-1848941486) about ""Big news or no news"" is:

""Canoo‚Äôs choice not to have any big news announcements this quarter was intentional, a **way to distinguish the company from the previous bombast of other EV hopefuls.** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty proud of the discipline,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we put the big-news-no-news concept out there, because [the EV industry] was just **so full of shit for so long.‚Äù**

By the way, in the past 2 weeks we have seen more engagement from Tony from a PR perspective then we have seen since Canoo went public, just an interesting side note. The secrecy has driven a lot of Canoo investors mad, but for me, it's a nice change of pace to see Tony out and about talking about Canoo.

Anyways, back on topic, here are the requirements to achieve this loan..

**1)** Manufacture eligible vehicles or components that are used in eligible vehicles. Vehicles that meet or exceed a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency beyond a 2005 model...and/or ultra-efficient vehicles which achieve a fuel efficiency of 75 miles per gallon or equivalent using alternative fuels.

**Canoo:** Electric vehicles, automatically hits this requirement.

**2)** Build new facilities; reequip, modernize, or expand existing facilities; and/or for engineering integration performed in the United States related to the manufacturing of eligible vehicles or components.

**Canoo:** 2 Factories in construction, R&D, Manufacturing of EV‚Äôs, Canoo hits this requirement.

**3)** Be located in the United States. Foreign ownership or sponsorship of the projects is permissible as long as the project is located in one of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory.

**Canoo:** Hits this requirement..

**4)** Provide a reasonable prospect of repayment.

Canoo: Has 750 Million in future revenue via preorders (It can be argued that a ‚ÄúReasonable prospect of repayment‚Äù would include these preorders. ‚ÄúReasonable‚Äù is the keyword here. I can‚Äôt say one way or another that Canoo hits this requirement just quite yet as production has not started.

**5)** loan recipients must be ""financially viable without the receipt of additional Federal funding associated with the proposed project

**Canoo:** I believe Canoo hits this requirement with their current announced dilutive funding, or, possibly with another round of non-dilutive funding, as speculated above.

To conclude, Canoo might tap 1, or even all of these non dilutive funding options in certain ways. This will allow the company to not have to raise capital via stock sales (to the point that it would be detrimental to the company‚Äôs current shareholders) (ALL IMO)	
__________________________
**Section 2 - Future Revenue**
__________________

On the last ER Call, Tony stated that the Company is looking to produce 3 to 6k Vehicles this year, and 20k ish next year. While also projecting all of these would be sold out once produced. 

The company has announced 17,500 preorders (not including fleet orders) from organic marketing, with potential revenues of 750 Mil from preorders alone.

Interestingly enough, Tony has said on ER calls that they want the first batch of Canoo's produced in 2022/2023 to go to fleet orders.

I believe the market is heavily discounting the reality of Canoo producing their target of 23-26k by the end of 2024 due to funding uncertainty. Of course, the market could add in a discount because building a car in mass quantity is no easy task, but with over 800+ employees with extensive knowledge in the automotive industry and Executives/workforce with former employment with all of the major OEMs, I believe they'll hit their targets with the only barrier to delivery of vehicles being cash. (In the absence of black swan events such as worsening supply chain issues)

Canoo has such an experienced and solid group of employees, that outlets such as Bloomberg speculate that Apple could [acquire Canoo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-05-15/apple-ramps-up-hiring-for-car-project-will-apple-aapl-acquire-canoo-goev-l37cnepx) specifically for their workforce...Article this month.

Currently, the company is producing up to 12 Gamma vehicles (Source is their Q1 Call Transcript, can't like a SA Article here) a week without their first factory fully functional factory. (This first factory is expected to produce 3-6k Units by the end of the year) 

________________________
**Section 3 - How Canoo is going to revolutionize the Auto industry**
________________________
Well, I have my own thoughts on this. So much thinking in the past year and half. And in fact, I was inspired to write this post because of this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/klugesan/status/1530356614041161731) by John Kluge (@klugesan) who had a phone call with Tony Aquila this past week and shared some insights with us. Please read this thread, summarizes my thoughts almost exactly. Summarizes Canoo's Vision quite well .

John Kluge is the founder of [Refugee Investments](https://refugeeinvestments.org/). They describe themselves on the home page as ""CONNECTING INVESTORS AND REFUGEE VENTURES FOR AN INCLUSIVE FUTURE"" and also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/klugesan/status/1530224675174981632) that he is excited for potential future collaboration with Canoo. 

I'm not really sure what exactly that would entail in terms of monetary value, but it seems from an ESG standpoint, John Kluge [believes](https://twitter.com/klugesan/status/1530356621083570176) canoo will ""Attract significant impact investing capital (something I can say with confidence given my work)."" 

Should read the whole thread for all the context.

Like I mentioned in the above, CEO Tony has been on an absolute rampage of interviews and phone calls that I guess happened to become public. 

I jokingly told my brother that John Kluge (with the phone call summary) gave us more insight about Canoo then Tony has in the past 2 years heh. 

Truly has potential to be an amazing story and no one is really paying attention!
________________________
 **Section 4 - Media FUD**
__________________

Along with the announcement that Canoo has access to 600 Million in Funding, Canoo also issued a ‚ÄúGoing concern‚Äù warning in their last ER due to cash burn and not having enough runway for the next year on the balance sheet. Essentially they are required to issue this warning by law due to their cash burn. And this leads me to presenting, MEDIA FUD.

The main FUD for Canoo right now is the fact that Canoo issued the ‚ÄúGoing Concern‚Äù warning and that Canoo has a high chance of being out of business in the next year. 

[Bloomberg FUD Article #1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-10/canoo-shares-sink-after-ev-maker-issues-going-concern-warning) 

[Reuters FUD Article #2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-canoo-has-substantial-doubt-about-going-concern-cash-runs-low-2022-05-10/)

[BI FUD Article #3](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ev-maker-s-stock-tanks-amid-going-concern-warning-lawsuit-against-china-linked-shareholder-1031447024)

Notice how all of these articles only mention that Canoo is a going concern case, and not a single mention of the non-dilutive funding that Canoo is quite obviously looking at. 

Like, can you imagine one of these outlets talking about how Canoo is partnering with the Cherokee Nation and how that represents opportunities to raise cash via Opportunity zones? Or that Craig Irwin (Roth Capital Analyst) believes Canoo has applied for a ATVM loan?

CEO Tony himself has said they are looking at opportunity zones in the past and recent past. But I guess that's too complex of a concepts for Bloomberg and Business Insider. 

Oh and, hilariously, the headlines don‚Äôt mention even the dilutive funding Canoo has access to. It just has to lead with the doom and gloom, that retail sucks it up. Another reason why I believe Canoo is heavily underlooked at. We all know the retail little guy isn't actually reading articles. Especially on Twitter and Reddit, these platforms are so headline sensitive. No one's actually clicking the article or doing their own research!

What headline stirs up more emotion, ""(EV Company) has substantial doubt going forward"" or ""(EV Company) secures $600 Mil and looks at Opportunity Zones"" I mean, no one really knows what an opportunity zone, it's relatively new. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Late 2017) created the Opportunity Zones program to spur investment in economically distressed census tracts. 

The amount of ""RIP Canoo"" and ""Another one bites the dust"" comments I read post ER made me want to pull my hair out. Retail truly isn't getting the full picture and reporters are almost fully to blame.

In fact, this has been so blatantly misleading that Canoo themselves (Via Twitter) had to tweet out to 8 news outlets that they are not actually going out of business because they have access to funding (Albeit dilutive) at the very least. 

[Example#1](https://twitter.com/CARandDRIVER/status/1524425398976659456)

[Example#2](https://twitter.com/engadget/status/1524393645297786880)

[Example #3](https://twitter.com/verge/status/1524322690185797632)

[Example#4](https://twitter.com/business/status/1524251463727386624)

My personal favorite ^ Bloomberg. Just read these headlines...

[Example #5](https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1524172816974766080)

[Example #6](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1524247980508913665)

[Example #7](https://twitter.com/alexa_stjohn/status/1524153759387033601)

[Example #8](https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1524134778148114432)

I just imagine Tony went up to the social media intern and was like, ""ok so today you're going to find every news outlet that is spreading FUD and reply with the rest of the story..""

But the Media FUD didn't just begin this last ER, if you've been following Canoo since early 2021, you would remember that the main FUD talking points in 2021 were: 

A) ""Canoo Employee departures"" (Employee turnover is quite common for startups) 

and 

B) ""SEC is investigating Canoo"" 

Which, by the way, nothing ever came of the ""SEC Investigation"" (Or at least, has not concluded. It's been more then a year now with not a peep from the SEC or Canoo about it since) 

""The SEC has also informed the Company that the investigation does not mean that it has concluded that anyone has violated the law, and does not mean that it has a negative opinion of any person, entity or security. We intend to provide the requested information and cooperate fully with the SEC investigation,‚Äù Canoo noted in the regulatory filing - [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoo-is-being-investigated-by-the-sec/)

In my opinion, and this article talks briefly about this, when tony came on board with Canoo as CEO and Chairman, there was a major business plan change that brings us to the Canoo we know today. This might have piqued the SEC's interest in fact finding.

I believe nothing will come of the ""Investigation"" and is completely different to other EV startup SEC investigations. For example, SEC Came out and blatantly accused Lordstown of [misleading investors](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders) and looked into short seller report claims of [Nikola](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/10/cars/nikola-milton-subpoenas/index.html)

Remember Trevor Milton? Rolling Nikola trucks down a hill?

[Lordstown](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/) and [Nikola](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nikola-stock-price-short-seller-report-alleges-years-deception-hindenburg-2020-9-1029579021) were both targets of a short seller report by Hindenburg.

Workhorse also was the target of a short seller [report](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/workhorse-falls-short-seller-claim-it-misled-investors) accusing them of fraud. Workhorse is also in the middle of an SEC [investigation](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652319/workhorse-fraud-sec-investigation-short-seller-fuzzy-panda)

Mullen Automotive also was the victim of a Hindenburg short seller report..

[""Yet Another Fast Talking EV Hustle"" - Hindenburg](https://hindenburgresearch.com/mullen/)

[Lucid](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/shares-of-ev-start-up-lucid-tank-on-sec-probe-.html) is also the target of an SEC investigation. Which seems to be regarding it's business combination with Churchill.

Canoo never received a short report, and the SEC/Canoo never told the public what it was looking to find/(Or have found) with Canoo. A year has passed and we have not heard a single update on the ""investigation"". 

I believe it was a nothing burger and Canoo has **demonstrably** shown its difference from a hype and wild claims standpoint compared to the other EV startups since completing it's business combination in late 2020. 

My point is, since day 1, media coverage on Canoo has been spotty at best, intentionally misleading at worst, and has ignored major elements of the overall story and progress.

**1) State Partnerships**

**State Partner: Oklahoma**

Purpose: Factory #2 - Pryor OK

2,000 Employees to be hired

Native Americans & Local Oklahomans 

State Incentives and Fleet orders:
[$300 million in incentives](https://tulsaworld.com/business/local/canoo-ceo-confirms-300-million-incentives-number-from-state-for-pryor-factory/article_2c5b4ee2-0040-11ec-a337-1f3f8bab9e60.html) paid to Canoo upon reaching certain milestones with the advancement and construction of the Pryor Factory. 

These incentives are valued at almost half of the market cap of Canoo. These incentives won‚Äôt pay out until milestones such as hiring, construction (paid out of Canoo‚Äôs pocket) etc are completed. So if Pryor factory never pans out, Canoo won‚Äôt see the $300 million.

[1,000 Vehicle order by the State of Oklahoma](https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/oklahoma-officials-waived-competitive-bidding-to-give-ev-startup-canoo-a-potentially-lucrative-statewide-contract/)

**State Partner: Arkansas**

Purpose: Factory #1 - Bentonville Arkansas

Low Scale production to test and validate manufacturing equipment and scaling processes before beginning production at their ‚ÄúMega Microfactory‚Äù in Oklahoma (The Pryor Factory)

Slated to build 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles by the end of this year. 

R&D Facility - Fayetteville Arkansas

Both the Bentonville Factory and the Fayetteville Facility will employ approximately 545  Employees Combined.

State Incentives and Fleet orders:

No signed incentives package as of yet, [presumably still in negotiations](https://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/139947/peddling-a-canoo). No fleet orders yet as well, still in negotiations but the number being thrown around is 1000 vehicles like Oklahoma. 

**2) Inked Fleet Orders:**

**Frontdoor Collective** - [10,000 Vehicles](https://theloadstar.com/emerging-package-delivery-collective-an-alternative-in-going-the-final-mile/)

**3)** Various Partnerships:

**NASA** - Canoo Partners with NASA For the Artemis Moon Mission

This partnership will be incredible PR for Canoo. The Artemis Moon landing will be major hype as it's NASA's first mission back to the moon since the OG moon landing, and in mid 2023 Canoo's will be blared on national TV all summer long transporting NASA Astronauts to the launch pad for training exercises..I mean, come on, this is a startups wet dream in terms of marketing.

Contract value in the $100k's but any reasonable investor should look at this as a loss leader. Even if Canoo LOSES on this deal, it will purely pan out as a marketing cost. I believe this will be an incredible marketing opportunity. 

Also, according to Fox23, this will open up Canoo for [other](https://www.fox23.com/news/local/manufacturer-with-ties-pryor-lands-nasa-moon-landing-contract/3POL7UZYJZDRLOVLBBMFE4JPRM/) federal contracts (my speculation, DoD contracts)

Read about what exactly Canoo will be doing for NASA [Here](https://www.canoo.com/nasa/nasa-selects-canoo-electric-vehicles-for-artemis/)

**Panasonic** - Panasonic will [supply](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-selects-panasonic-to-supply-batteries-for-its-first-lifestyle-vehicle)  Canoo Batteries, like it does for Tesla.

Panasonic is currently in the center of a [battle](https://tulsaworld.com/news/state-and-regional/japanese-report-panasonic-wants-to-build-electric-vehicle-battery-plant-in-kansas-or-oklahoma/article_fbd4e0d2-9bd8-11ec-bd6a-53fa372648c9.html) between Oklahoma (remember, Canoo has a major incentive package in OK) and Kansas to secure billions in state incentives for Panasonics new USA Factory. These two states are rushing [legislation](https://nondoc.com/2022/04/18/oklahoma-incentivizes-panasonic-battery-plant/) to lure a ""Mystery company"" (Pana) to their state. 

Although they have not directly said Panasonic, it's easily the worst kept secret in the room and without a doubt, it is Panasonic. A decision as to which state Panasonic will finally pick is expected at any moment.

""During a 1 p.m. press conference today, Stitt(OK Governor) said a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from saying the word ‚ÄúPanasonic‚Äù or revealing exact job estimates and financial figures related to the project. **But numerous people with knowledge of the situation have confirmed Panasonic is the company in question**.""

In Fact, the legislators in OK have dubbed their efforts on attracting Panasonic as [Project Ocean](https://ktul.com/news/local/project-ocean-incentive-plan-making-progress) and have passed Oklahoma Housebill 4455 which is the $700M for ‚Äúproject ocean‚Äù [split up](https://www.tahlequahdailypress.com/news/some-lawmakers-want-tax-cuts-not-698m-business-incentive/article_402b5c3a-493b-5e1b-bfad-2638b5e6b713.html?utm_campaign=blox&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) between Panasonic and Canoo.

""It pays $613 million to a ‚Äúmega project‚Äù and allocates $85 million to another project related to the same industry."" (Panasonic and Canoo, respectively. $85 Mil allocatted to Canoo is part of the overall incentives package that I spoke about above)

""Citing nondisclosure agreements, top lawmakers continue to refuse to name the company targeted by the legislation. However, other lawmakers confirmed to CNHI Oklahoma that the two companies are **Panasonic and Canoo.**""

I find it very curious that Pana and Canoo are bundled into legislation..

Panasonic in OK will be bullish for Canoo due to shipping costs at the very least, but I also believe the two companies could form a JV given the context, just like [Panasonic has done with Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/blog/panasonic-and-tesla-sign-agreement-gigafactory) for that battery supplying relationship

**Section 6 - Speculation on potential deals, partnerships, and acquisition of Canoo.**
__________________

With nothing but conjecture, I believe Canoo will continue to land major fleet orders. CEO Tony Aquila talked in the last call about potential fleet order customers testing out Canoo Gamma vehicles.

Regardless, here are some speculative articles. It‚Äôs fun to see the rumor mill churn, adds a bit of a flare to any company..

[walmart DD and Speculation Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvdrtu/canoo_walmart_hints_speculation/) - Thank you r/OE4000

________________________
**Section 7 - Short Interest Data**
__________________

For me, Canoo is a long term investment, However, I believe there is a major short term catalyst and that is the short interest..

**Short Interest of Float:** 31% Si of float

**Utilization:** 100% for the past several months now

**CTB:** 45% 

As of 5/27/2022 - [6 Month CTB Chart + 6 Month GOEV Price Chart](https://imgur.com/a/PY73OFk)

I like how CTB is on a general uptrend. I mean, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good or bad. I'm not a short data connoisseur. But the CTB uptrend looks provocative. Can‚Äôt be bad if shorts have to pay more to short Canoo..[right..? right‚Ä¶?](https://imgur.com/a/KUJ5fpc)

**DTC (Days To Cover Ratio):** 14

An overlooked ratio for short data imo, Days to Cover. Personally my favorite exacerbated short related number. DTC is essentially how many days it would take shorts to cover at the current average volume traded on a stock. Canoo has a 14 DTC, ridiculously high.

# **Stocks could build on gains in the week ahead as investors await Friday‚Äôs jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/27/stocks-could-build-on-gains-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-await-fridays-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> Stocks could carry the momentum of this latest rally into next week as investors look ahead to Friday‚Äôs jobs report.
*****
> All three major indice scored big gains in the past week, each rising higher than 6%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite broke a seven-week losing streak, while it had been eight weeks of losses for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think this is the beginning of that long-awaited relief rally,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
*****
> In the four-day week ahead, there are just a handful of earnings, with reports from Salesforce.com, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and online pet retailer Chewy.
*****
> The May employment report Friday is the most important data on a calendar that also includes ISM manufacturing, job openings data, monthly vehicle sales and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs beige book, all on Wednesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the 325,000 consensus [nonfarm payrolls] number, we could easily beat. But it‚Äôs just math,‚Äù said Alex Chaloff, co-head of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. He noted there could be positive revisions in prior month‚Äôs data, as there have been in recent reports.
*****
> Economists have expected the pace of job creation to slow from 428,000 jobs in April. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt continue to grow at that type of pace, especially with Covid spiking. That‚Äôs a little bit of air cover for the 325,000 number,‚Äù said Chaloff.
*****
> # A recovery after the Fed‚Äôs minutes
Stocks in the past week were choppy but moved sharply higher, especially after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its last meeting.
*****
> The S&P 500 gained 6.5% to 4,158, the best week since November, 2020. The Dow was up 6.2%, while the Nasdaq was the outperformer, up 6.8%.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt was waiting for some sort of a catalyst, and I think it got it from the Fed. Not only was it not more hawkish, but it said it would look to expedite the rate tightening,‚Äù said Stovall.
*****
> ‚ÄúSo I think a lot of investors thought they were frontloading the rate hiking cycle, implying they could end up pausing in the third quarter sometime,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs what was the rally trigger. The market just got oversold on a breadth and sentiment perspective and was ripe for some sort of good news and the Fed delivered.‚Äù
*****
> Chaloff said the market is expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half percentage point, at each of its next two meetings. That could mean choppy trading through that period, but he added the first time the Fed returns to a quarter-point pace of hiking, the market should rally hard.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think this is the early stage of a bounce but we have a Fed meeting in June. We have a Fed meeting in July,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will have an impact on markets. It will have jitters when the Fed is acknowledging they have work to do. We‚Äôre not saying this is the floor... But it‚Äôs great to see markets reacting appropriately to solid macro data.‚Äù
*****
> For now though, stocks could head higher. ‚ÄúI would say it hasn‚Äôt been a really crazy volume week, so it‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs great to go into the long weekend, starting the summer with some strength, but the breadth and depth hasn‚Äôt been there,‚Äù Chaloff said. ‚ÄúI want to say ‚ÄòOkay, everybody, we‚Äôre not dancing. We‚Äôre not there yet‚Äô ‚Ä¶ We think we‚Äôre through the worst of it, but not all of it.‚Äù
*****
> # Looking for catalysts
Chaloff said he will be watching to see if hedge funds, which had been unloading holdings, start to buy in the coming week, a possible positive catalyst for the market.
*****
> ‚ÄúThese kinds of weeks like this help build on themselves, so while it‚Äôs not a breakthrough week, it‚Äôs an important week,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Any developments over the weekend could be important, but weekends are also a time when investors reflect. ‚ÄúIf you have a really bad week, and people can‚Äôt touch their money for 48 or 72 hours, you really have a bad open to start the week,‚Äù Chaloff said.
*****
> Bond yields in the past week were lower and steadier. The 10-year yield was at about 2.74% Friday.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs positive for stocks and obviously bonds,‚Äù Chaloff said. ‚ÄúAfter seven, eight weeks of outflows you‚Äôre starting to get inflows into fixed income instruments of all types, and that keeps yields constrained.‚Äù
*****
> That is also a positive for growth companies that were the hardest hit as interest rates rose.
*****
> Markets close out the month of May on Tuesday. As of Friday, the Dow and S&P 500 were both flattish for the month but negative for the Nasdaq.
*****
> Stovall said June is usually positive for the S&P 500. ‚ÄúJune has typically few swoons. It‚Äôs sort of middling in terms of performance,‚Äù he said.

> # It's Over

> Spring is meant to be a season of growth, but that's the last way to describe what's been going on in financial markets for the last several weeks. The S&P 500 came into April with a three-week winning streak on Friday, April 1st, but in what has been one of the cruelest April Fools pranks we've ever seen, the S&P 500 was down for seven straight weeks in what was the longest weekly losing streak since March 2001. For the DJIA, the streak was even more extreme with eight straight weekly declines for the longest run of consecutive declines in 99 years. 99 years is a long time.

> As shown in the chart below, the streak that ended this week was one of just three other periods where the S&P 500 was down for seven or more straight weeks. The other three were in May 1970 (8 weeks), March 1980 (7 weeks), and March 2001 (8 weeks). Besides relentless selling over several weeks, the other factor these three periods have in common is that they all occurred during recessions. May 1970 was right in the middle of a recession, March 1980 was two months into the first of the 'double-dip' recessions in the early 1980s, and March 2001 came just as the economy was starting to roll over from the dot-bomb fueled contraction. Economists have assured anyone who will listen that the economy isn't close to a recession yet, but then again, in Q1 the economy contracted by 1.5%, and the latest projection from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model currently has a forecast of just 1.9% growth for Q2.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052722-Weekly-Losing-Streaks.png))**

> As an investor, whether we're in a recession or not at this point is almost irrelevant. Equities have already fallen sharply. The more important question is where the economy is going. Anyone who has that kind of crystal ball has a distinct advantage. Think about it. When a recession begins, no one watching just the economy ever knows what is about to unfold. They may be thought of as periods of economic weakness and high unemployment, but the start of a recession also coincides with the point at which the economy is at its strongest and firing on all cylinders. The last thing on anyone's mind at that point is a recession.

> In terms of the prior streaks where the S&P 500 declined for seven or more weeks in a row, forward performance was mixed but generally positive. Three is admittedly a small sample size, but one, three, six, and twelve months later, the S&P 500 was higher at least two out of three times, and three months later (13 weeks) it was higher all three times. 2022 has been a lousy year so far. Wouldn't it be nice, though, if six months from now at Thanksgiving, instead of everyone worrying about a new emerging strain of COVID (like we did last year), we were all thankful that stocks and bonds stabilized and maybe, just maybe, even partly dug themselves out of the hole they've already put themselves into?

> # Bulls Back Below 20%

> In spite of the S&P 500 actually reversing course and heading higher in the past week, sentiment on the part of individual investors surveyed by the American Association of Individual Investors has turned lower, once again falling below 20%. That is the first sub-20% reading since the last week of April, although the multiple readings in the mid-teens last month were lower than this week's reading.

> The past several months as the major indices have entered downtrends have seen an impressive collapse in optimism. Over the past six months, slightly more than half of the time less than a quarter of AAII respondents have reported as bullish. Going back through the history of the survey beginning in the late 1980s, there have only been two other periods with this same sort of consistently pessimistic attitude for an extended period of time: late 1988 to early 1989 and two years later in early 1991.

> # One Of The Worst Starts Ever After 100 Days, But There Is Hope

> Yesterday was the 100th trading day of the year for 2022 and although stocks managed to gain about 1%, it was still the worst start to a year since 1970 for the S&P 500 Index.

> In fact, it is the fourth worst start to a year ever after 100 days, with only 1932 (Great Depression), 1940 (World War II), and 1970 (Vietnam and a recession) worse.

> There is actually some good news in there though, as we‚Äôve usually seen the previous worst starts ever come back nicely‚Äîsometimes in record fashion. ‚ÄúDown 16.5% after 100 days for the S&P 500 is the worst start to a year since 1970 and one of the worst starts ever,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúBut the good news is previous bad starts have seen some nice rubber band snap backs and 2022 could be in line to do it once again.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous five worst starts to a year ever saw the remainder of the year higher every single time, up 19.1% on average compared with the average rest of the year gain of 5.0%. 2022 has been very tough, but most investors would likely take a 19% bounce the rest of the year.

> ‚ÄúLife is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.‚Äù ‚Äì Albert Einstein

> The S&P 500 Index was down more than 20% on an intraday basis on Friday, but managed a huge rally late to avoid closing down 20% and moving into an official bear market. With the S&P 500 down 18.7% though (as of Friday‚Äôs close) a bear market is still quite possible.

> One more look at the table above shows that only three times were stocks lower a year later and all were associated with major recessions. We do not see a recession on the horizon, which could be a clue returns could be strong going out a year.

> What about how quickly after a bear market starts do stocks finally stop going down? This one has something for everyone, as the least ever was only 1 day in 1957, while it took 19 months for the bleeding to stop in the early 2000s. Once again though, if the bear happened around a recession, the weakness usually continued much longer and vice versa. 1962, 1966, and 1987 all recovered quickly and didn‚Äôt happen in a recession. Meanwhile, stocks did manage to bottom quickly during the recessions of 1957 and 2020. While the recessions of 1974, the early 1980s, dot com burst, and the financial crisis all saw the damage continue for much longer.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it took about 19 months on average for stocks to recover their bear market losses. The good news is the past three bear markets recouped losses in 5, 4, and 4 months. Additionally, if the bear market was worse, it took longer to recover. This was not very surprising, but when the bear market decline was less than 22%, it took only seven months on average to make up the losses versus 27 months if the bear was worse than -22%. Should this bear market end soon (our base case), it could bode well for a quicker recovery once again.

> Lastly, there have been a lot of bear markets over time, but one thing that has always happened is stocks have eventually come back to new highs. We do not know when this one will, but we don‚Äôt expect this incredible streak to end now.

> Investors with longer-term horizons should use this weakness as an opportunity, or Einstein said in the above quote, we‚Äôve got to keep our balance and move forward.

> # Breaking ""the Mondays""

> We've talked a lot in the past about how the overwhelming majority of the equity market's gains in the last several decades have come outside of regular trading hours. When you consider the fact that active trading in US equity markets is less than 20% of all the time in a given week, it would make sense that most news occurs outside of trading hours. Therefore, when good news breaks outside of trading hours, stocks typically gap higher in response, and when there's bad news, they gap lower at the next open.

> So far, 2022 has generally been a case of the latter. With issues like rising prices, tighter monetary and fiscal policy, and the war in Europe, there really hasn't been much in the way of good news for investors to digest over the weekends, and therefore, when markets do start a new week of trading, performance has been anemic at best. Three charts illustrate this trend.

> This morning the S&P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) gapped up 0.80% which was the largest upside gap in SPY to kick off a new trading week since late November. Today's strong open also broke a streak of 20 straight weeks where SPY's opening gap to kick off a week was negative or a gain of less than 0.30%. The chart below shows historical streaks where SPY's opening gap on the first trading day of the week was negative or below 0.30%. The streak that just ended was the third-longest in SPY's history, behind the 30-week streak ending August 2005 and the 22-week streak in June 2006. Both of those streaks came in the middle of the Fed's early 2000s rate hike cycle where it raised rates by 25 bps for 17 straight meetings spanning June 2004 through June 2006 and took the Fed Funds Rate from 1.0% to 5.25% in the process.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052322-Streaks1.png))**

> Not only has there been a general lack of significant upside pressure to markets to kick off the trading week lately, but the trend has actually been in the opposite direction. Heading into today, SPY gapped lower to kick off the trading week 15 times in the last 19 weeks, and over the last six months, there were only 17 weeks where SPY gapped higher to kick off a week. In the entire history of SPY since the early 1990s, there have only been five other periods where there was a higher frequency of downside gaps to kick off a trading week in a six-month span, and they all peaked at 18.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/052322-Negative-Gaps.png))**

> Lastly, with the S&P 500 consistently opening lower to kick off the week, it would only make sense that the six-month average opening gap of the trading week would also be negative, and that's exactly what we have seen. Over the last six months (26-weeks), SPY's average opening gap to kick off a trading week has been a decline of 0.28% which is the weakest reading since the COVID crash (when there was a lot of bad news) and before that, the only two other weaker periods were in the six months ending in July 2009 and February 2002. If you were involved in the market in either of those periods, you remember that there was not a lot to be optimistic about in either period...sort of like now. They call it ""the Mondays"" for a reason, and lately, equities have had a bad case of them.

I have recently become in position to be an aggressive buyer and I was looking to begin this next month or July at the very latest.

While I am glad that I read these comments before I went on a buying spree, I don't have the benefit of having a thesis behind me inaction outside of ""people on reddit are saying they're waiting"".

So I was hoping that more experienced investors could share their insights on why they don't think we've reached the bottom.

I would definitely like to know if these opinions are shaped in comparing this economy to past economic situations, technical analyses, or something else. Ideally, this would be a great learning opportunity for me, so I am hoping that people don't mind sharing their opinions on this so I could do my own due diligence by vetting the responses.

Thanks in advance.

ETA: I am not looking for people to tell me what to do. I have my own sense of what the market is doing, but that still doesn't stop me from wanting to learn why others may see the market differently.

This isn't a ""tell me how to think"" post. It's also not an effort to time the market.

271,Can the U.S. stock market rally continue? Analysts: 10 reasons to tell you it can,2,uyxwu4,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uyxwu4/can_the_us_stock_market_rally_continue_analysts/,6,"Some market analysts pointed out that the rebound of US stocks this week is likely to be sustainable.

In terms of market conditions, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have fallen for 7 consecutive weeks, and the Dow has even fallen for 8 consecutive weeks. But judging from the current gains, all three major indexes seem to be able to stop their decline this week, with the Dow and S&P 500 both up more than 4%. On the news side, the minutes of the Fed meeting released on Wednesday were in line with market expectations. Beyer investment strategy analyst Ross Mayfield explained that it is a good thing for Fed officials to agree, which means that there is no uncertainty about the direction of policy in the short term.

Since the beginning of this year, the rebound in US stocks like this week has been relatively ""short-lived"". The S&P 500 briefly rallied above 4,600 in late March, but each subsequent rally has been accompanied by a deeper retracement.

But Frank Cappelleri, chief market technologist at Nomura-owned Instinet, thinks the rally that started this week is likely to continue, citing 10 reasons why:

**1. The S&P 500 closed for the 5th consecutive day**

Thursday marked the fifth straight session for the index to close above the midpoint for the day, which was much better than the late-day sell-off that has been common in recent weeks, Cappelleri said.

**2. The NYSE's ""TICK"" index hit its highest level in more than a year on Wednesday**

Simply put, the TICK Index = the number of stocks that rose minus the number of stocks that fell on the NYSE. The index touched 1,822 intraday on Wednesday, a level that Cappelleri said typically provides more upside.

**3. Considering the decline of the S&P 500 this year, there is some support at the current level**

Cappelleri pointed out that as long as the support level is not broken, the S&P 500 is unlikely to see a deeper decline at the moment.

**4. The S&P 500 has a ""DeMark Buy Signal""**

Simply put, this indicator shows the market's demand for the underlying asset by comparing the latest high and low prices with previous prices in the same period. Through this comparison, we can assess the trend of the market.

https://preview.redd.it/7upp6cjpp0291.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f23e3b1286fe038d65ac51d40a2ff30540949966

**5. The S&P 500 is above a key trend line**

Cappelleri claimed that losses earlier this month meant the index could easily dip below 3,950, but the index has bounced back above that level several times recently.

**6. The market is establishing a ""bullish pattern""**

Cappelleri said the S&P 500 has jumped above key levels in recent days, a sign that buyers may be returning to the market and will remain in the market.

**7. Fewer ETFs are hitting new lows**

Only nine ETFs hit new lows this week, compared with 24 last week and 96 last week.

**8. High-yield bond prices are rising**

From the perspective of related ETFs, the U.S. high-yield bond ETF-iShares rose 1.52% on Wednesday, the largest gain in two years, and rose nearly 1.4% on Thursday. That means investors have more confidence in companies' credit and less fear of a recession, Cappelleri noted.

**9. The dollar has fallen**

The dollar's steady rise this year is bad news for stocks. However, the dollar has recently fallen from 52-week highs, which is a welcome phenomenon, Cappelleri said.

**10. The S&P 500 has been able to ""stabilize its position"" in the face of bad news**

On Tuesday, the stock price of social media company snap plummeted 43% due to the lowered performance forecast, and dragged down social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Google, pinterest, and Twitter, and the market value of the sector evaporated by more than 100 billion US dollars. That also contributed to the day's drop in the S&P 500, according to Cappelleri.

But he also pointed out that the index rebounded quickly afterwards, rising for two straight days on Wednesday and Thursday, which may indicate that the market has digested most concerns about the economy and corporate earnings.",1653657069.0
272,$NVDA earnings takes - solid long term opportunity,31,uydape,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uydape/nvda_earnings_takes_solid_long_term_opportunity/,6,"Nvidia reported strong Q1 earnings and guided to Q2 Revenues below consensus driven by Russia/China impact of \~$500mm. The impact is $100mm in Data Center and $400mm to Gaming. With this impact - gaming is down mid-teens vs. some investors expected down 20-30%, causing a squeeze for the stock.

**Data Center** (now the largest segment ) **grew 66% YoY** and the company expects it to grow sequentially in each quarter Q0Q (despite the headwind).

**Gaming** \- still realizing underlying growth, but in 2Q growth will be more than offset by the $400mm headwind and the total guide for the segment is to be **down teens**. China is 1/2-2/3rd of the $400 and the company expects this to come back in subsequent quarters, although it is hard to know the timing.

Data Center growth is encouraging. Some investors worry that the Gaming segment is not completely de-risked as the cut was not due to weak markets, but China/Russia. While this may be true, we would highlight that this is still a re-set (i.e. if gaming weakens broadly, China coming back would offset that headwind).

Nvidia has a unique opportunity on the Data Center side to become the standard of AI. The company has over 80% market share in AI. Only small part of the long term opportunity is included in the company's revenue today.

While stock-market strategists at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley grow increasingly bearish, JPMorgan‚Äôs equity-research department has churned up yet another bullish note for the bank‚Äôs clients, advising them about the potential for massive¬†month- and quarter-end rebalancing flows that could trigger a sustained rebound in stocks, putting even more distance between the U.S. benchmarks and the bear-market territory with which the S&P 500 index was flirting late last week.

The team of JP Morgan equity quants, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, told the bank's clients that potentially more than $250 billion could flow into stocks by the end of June as American mutual funds and pension funds, along with foreign pensions and sovereign wealth funds, ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù by buying stocks and selling bonds.

# [Dow futures gain as the market tries to snap long weekly losing streaks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/25/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose slightly Thursday, as Wall Street tried to rebound from a long string of weekly declines.
*****
> Dow futures rose 141 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq advanced 0.3%.
*****
> The Dow has fallen the last eight weeks, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding seven-week losing streaks.
*****
> However, the market seems to have somewhat regained its footing this week, as investors hope inflation is starting to peak and that there‚Äôs good value to be found at these levels. The Dow and S&P 500 are up 2.75% and 2%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq is also up 0.7%.
*****
> The Dow has also posted gains in the last four sessions.
*****
> The move in futures comes after strong earnings from the retail sector. Macy‚Äôs shares surged 15% in premarket trading after the company raised its 2022 profit outlook, and Williams-Sonoma rose 8.3% after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines.
*****
> Discount retailers Dollar Tree and Dollar General jumped 12% and 10%, respectively, after posting earnings beats.
*****
> On the flipside, shares of chipmaker Nvidia dropped 5.6% in the premarket after the company delivered weaker-than-expected guidance for the second quarter and the company‚Äôs CFO said Nvidia would slow hiring. Similarly, software stock Snowflake tumbled 14% after the company‚Äôs guidance for operating margin came in narrower than expected.
*****
> Though first-quarter earnings for the market as a whole have been largely in line with historical trends, there have been dramatic pullbacks for some major stocks after earnings reports as investors look for the impact of inflation and slowing economic growth.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs any reason to sell, they‚Äôre embracing it,‚Äù said Jeremy Gonsalves, national director of portfolio management at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> Elsewhere, Twitter shares jumped more than 5% after Elon Musk increased his commitment in his takeover bid to $33.5 billion, which analysts have said indicates a new seriousness and increased probability that he‚Äôll complete the deal.
*****
> Chipmaker Broadcom announced plans to buy cloud company VMware in a $61 billion deal, which would be one of the biggest tech acquisitions of all time. Broadcom shares fell more than 1%, while VMWare shares inched higher.
*****
> Stocks rose Wednesday, with the Nasdaq gaining 1.5% to lead the way. The S&P 500 added 0.9%, while the Dow gained 0.6%.
*****
> Investors will get an updated look at weekly jobless claims and a second read on first-quarter GDP. Data on pending home sales will follow later in the morning.

294,"The minutes of the Fed meeting are coming, will the falling stock market have a respite?",36,uxgtty,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uxgtty/the_minutes_of_the_fed_meeting_are_coming_will/,15,"The Fed will release the minutes of its May monetary policy meeting today, the FOMC meeting minutes. This follows the Fed's decision to raise the policy rate by 50 basis points at this month's FOMC meeting, raising the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.75%-1.00%. Then last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in an interview with the media that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) broadly supports raising interest rates by 50 basis points each at the next two meetings.

For now, the market seems to have priced in two more rate hikes by the Fed, each by 50 basis points. The latest data from the CME Group Fed watch Tool shows that the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 50 basis points in June and July is about 90%; the market currently expects the possibility of the Fed to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at the June 15 meeting as high as 93.3 %, the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 50 basis points at its July 27 meeting is as high as 89.4%.

Still, there is room for an unexpectedly hawkish stance in the minutes of the FOMC's May meeting. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said the minutes may be a bit dated given recent comments from multiple Fed officials, but the discussion of balance sheet reductions in the minutes is still worth watching.

**First, the minutes of the FOMC meeting: focus on the details surrounding QT**

Investors are now awaiting FOMC minutes to provide more details on the Fed's quantitative tightening (QT) program to gain more insight into the Fed's deliberations on monetary policy tightening and officials' views on the economy.

Recent comments from former Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker suggest that there is room for further volatility in financial markets, and the Fed may be forced to moderate the pace of its balance sheet reduction in response to market volatility and widening credit spreads, while maintaining policy tightening to fight inflation. Make a choice, and the latter is the most likely option.

At the same time as the announcement of the FOMC meeting this month, the Fed announced that it will shrink its balance sheet by nearly $9 trillion from June 1 to match interest rate hikes and curb soaring inflation; it will be $47.5 billion per month. The scale is starting to shrink, rising to $95 billion a month in three months.

Specifically, the initial drawdown of U.S. Treasuries will be $30 billion per month, and after 3 months, the monthly drawdown will expand to $60 billion; the initial drawdown of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) will be $175 The monthly reduction will expand to $35 billion in three months.

New York Fed President John Williams said last week that their forecasts indicated they would miss their monthly MBS redemption target of $35 billion, adding that selling MBS could be an option going forward.

Jefferies economist Anetta Markowska believes that if prepayment rates drop from around 30% to 10%, as witnessed in the last tightening cycle, MBS outflows could average about $20 billion a month. In that case, the Fed would have to start selling MBS to hit its $95 billion monthly reduction target.

The problem with selling MBS is that they could translate into losses for the Fed. ""One of the downsides of selling is that, depending on the rate path, they could lead to a loss of real market value,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said earlier this month, acknowledging that this would be an intractable problem, Especially at the political level.

FXStreet's Eren Sengezer believes this could be seen as a hawkish development (bad for stocks) if the minutes show officials are willing to sell MBS to keep the $95bn monthly QT target regardless of potential political push . And if the minutes don't provide any new insights into the Fed's QT plan and reiterate that officials remain reluctant to commit to further policy action after two more 50bps rate hikes, he expects the dollar to continue to trade lower.

**Second, what impact might the FOMC minutes have? Will the S&P 500 have a bullish breakout?**

While risk assets have continued to fall recently, signs of consolidation are starting to raise hopes that stocks may be nearing a bottom, with the S&P 500 rebounding from session lows over the past few sessions, said Tina Teng, market analyst at CMC Markets. She said the upcoming FOMC minutes could be a catalyst for investors to shake off recent fears of a recession, although there has been no hint of a change in the Fed's rate hike trajectory.

Investing's Michael Kramer said the Fed minutes were in most cases a ""sell the news"" event. The volatility index VIX is already at high levels. He said the market could only fall again if the VIX saw a bigger spike. A move higher in the VIX requires a ""more hawkish"" minutes.

It is also worth mentioning that this week Atlanta Fed President Bostic said that it may be prudent to pause rate hikes in September, given that the Fed is likely to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points in June and July. ""Given that Bostic was one of the leading hawks at the start of the year, this seems to be very important, and may be a bit of a division of the Fed's monetary policy direction as we enter the second half of the year,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. first sign.",1653483568.0

‚Ä¢	Share price likely to decline sharply further, due to high valuation, slowing growth, and negative macro environment

Our trade

‚Ä¢	Long June 10 130/110 put spread, target a minimum of 20% decline from current price around $130

------------

Situation

New IPO, highly volatile, attractive segment, rapid growth, solid financials, extreme valuation, sign of a slowdown

‚Ä¢	IPO at $120 in Sept 2000, share price briefly traded above $400 before declining 67% to current level around $130

‚Ä¢	Selling analytics software (AS) and providing cloud data warehouse (CDW) services to enterprises

‚Ä¢	FY22 (end Jan 30 2021) revenue (REV) $1.2 bn (up 106% YOY), backlog $2.6 bn (up 98% YOY), gross margin (GM) 74%

‚Ä¢	Credible mgmt., solid balance sheet ($5.1 bn cash and $205 mm debt), cash flow positive, but not profitable yet

‚Ä¢	Market cap of $43 bn, at a price to sales ratio of 36, forward price to earnings over 1000, and PEG above 5

‚Ä¢	FY20, 21, 22, 23(guided) REV growth and GM are (164%, 120%, 106%, 66%) and (62.8%, 68.7%, 74.1%, 74.5%) respectively

Analysis

Growth to slow, fierce competition, negative environment to get worse, valuation needs to further normalize 

‚Ä¢	Slowdown inevitable after explosive growth during the pandemic, and amid recent market turmoil

ÔÇß	Sector growth still healthy but moderated, as seen in recent AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL ERs before market turmoil

ÔÇß	SNOW relied on B2C businesses - financial, retail, advertising, health care, and tech accounts for 85% of REV

ÔÇß	In Q4 FY22 call, mgmt. noted REV headwind but attributed to software upgrade and new pricing model

ÔÇß	FY23 growth guided lower, distress in core verticals, and recent SNAP negative update all indicate a slowdown

‚Ä¢	Competition fierce and likely to intensify, SNOW‚Äôs growth profile cannot justify an excessive valuation premium 

ÔÇß	SNOW bundles its analytic software (AS) with CDW offerings from AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGLE to sell to its clients

ÔÇß	AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL bundle their own AS and CDW, compete directly with SNOW

ÔÇß	Players swiftly copy one another, making their offerings difficult to distinguish, it is a constant arms race

ÔÇß	SNOW has to compete with dominate players (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL) with much larger R&D budget and staff, with legacy players (IBM, ORCL, etc.) beefing up their cloud offerings, and with new entrants (DDOG, HPE, etc.) 

ÔÇß	At REV of $1.2 bn, SNOW is very small compared to the cloud businesses of the dominant players but traded at a huge premium.  However, competition quickly drives its growth toward sector mean (roughly 40-50% in 2021)

ÔÇß	As pandemic recedes and growth further slows, competition likely to intensify, given the enormous investment in the space with numerous players of little differentiation competing for a smaller pie 

‚Ä¢	Macro environment took a turn for the worse

ÔÇß	NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 dropped roughly 30% and 20% amid high inflation, rate hike and QT, war, lockdown

ÔÇß	Fed hiked rate twice, 75 bps total, far away from the 300 bps expected, and has not even begun QT

ÔÇß	Early signs of severe economic slowdown are everywhere, and inflation remains high with April CPI at 8.3%

a.	New home sales down 16.6% in April after a 10.5% decline in March, 30-year mortgage rate at 5.5%

b.	Retailer inventory to sales at 30-40% (WMT, TGT, HD, KSS, etc.), a ratio normally ranging at +/-10%

c.	Firms began hiring freeze or firing (FB, NFLX, etc.), and guided earnings drastically lower (SNAP, ANF, etc.)

ÔÇß	Pressure mounting on Fed. Some market commentators and noted investors call for ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù tightening to defeat the inflation

ÔÇß	No alternatives for the Fed other than at the minimum to follow through its own plan of rate hikes and QT, against backdrop of a rapidly decelerating economy, elevating risks of a recession in 2023 or sooner

ÔÇß	Macro uncertainties will suppress demand and thus the growth of SNOW, regardless if there will be a recession

‚Ä¢	SNOW‚Äôs extreme valuation is incompatible with its growth profile and the near term macro and market outlook

Conclusion

‚Ä¢	SNOW share price likely to decline significantly more near term, even if ER meets or marginally beats expectations

Sales are the lowest since 582,000 in April 2020 during the worst of the pandemic downturn and since 550,000 in December 2018. The level is well below expectations in Econoday survey where the consensus is 750,000 and the low end of the range at 700,000.

The months' supply of new homes available for sale jumped to 9.0 in April after 6.9 in March and nearly twice the 4.7 in April 2021. April is the highest since 9.3 months' worth in May 2010.

Despite slower sales and more plentiful inventories, the median price of a new home rose 3.6 percent to $450,600 in April from March and is up 19.6 percent from a year earlier.

It is clear that rising prices and mortgage interest rates have substantially reduced home affordability. Early May data for homebuilders and mortgage applications strongly suggest that the housing market is cooling rapidly. The boom brought on by historic lows in mortgage rates and by changing housing needs during the pandemic, and later by rising incomes and rental costs is pretty much over. Homebuyers can expect an easing in price escalation and less competition for available units. It is unlikely, though, that prices are going to change course.

Note that today's report includes annual revisions back through January 2017.

317,The South Park Investing Strategy,30,ux2jns,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ux2jns/the_south_park_investing_strategy/,8,"**Intro**

Greetings you filthy animals! In light of the collapsing market I've been looking for investing strategies that still work (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uw86l4/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_500_this_year/)). This is another one of them!

**The Question**

Could a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?

**The Data**

I originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.

**The Strategy**

Being mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...

South Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to ""buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic."" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!

**Conclusion**

Idk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?)

Despite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun! Let me know what strategy I should test next!",1653430479.0

I don‚Äôt intend to post again in a short time with this kind of question. I want to thank everyone who answered to my questions in the previous message. But, partly because, English is not my native language, partly because I have now clearer what my doubt Is, I want riformulate it in a better and more synthetic way. 

Let be A a company with great fundamentals. In which ways I can make money investing in A. I would appreciate a lot, a list of the reasons to chose A to make money. In which way great fundamentals turn to money for the investor?
I can understand, for example these reasons:
1. Because A is likely to release dividends, that is, direct money for the investor, in the future.
2. Buyback, again, this implies more money for the investor.

There could be a third reason: because people buy companies with a solid intrinsic value. The subsequent question is: why do people buy companies with these characteristics? Which are the practical way to make money from these companies?
The only answer I am able to find is because there is a tacit rule that say to buy these company and so the price of these stocks go up. But I don‚Äôt see this third method to make money, based on solid premises. I see it really fragile. What am I missing?

Are you? - A discussion.,28,uwklf7,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uwklf7/is_the_market_returning_to_the_fundamentals_after/,24,"So I've been thinking about this and reading a lot of opinions about valuations of stock prices and how the past few years threw everyone off with the massive hypes of stocks and people seemingly ""letting go of the fundamentals"". Lately we've been reading how after this current dip, stocks are trying to find ‚Äúfair prices‚Äù and ""discover real valuations"" after being overvalued for years.. Personally, I have been investing mainly in blue chips, but also fell into hypes here and there.. Nothing like following that unhinged guy, but did buy some stocks without much DD but solely because ""I believe in the longterm of that stock/company"".. Mainly remained conservative as an investor though.. 

Are we going back to looking at things like P/E ratios (among other things) for identifying investments..? Or do you guys think we‚Äôll still run with the hype of ‚Äúcharismatic‚Äù leaders and the sentimental valuations of stocks?.. What are you guys thoughts on this?

# [Stock futures indicate the sell-off resuming on Wall Street after Monday‚Äôs brief rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell early Tuesday morning as the markets struggled to sustain a comeback rally following weeks of losses.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 202 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures dipped 1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.7%.
*****
> Snap shares plummeted more than 31% after the company said it‚Äôs bracing to miss earnings and revenue targets in the current quarter and warned of a hiring slowdown. Shares of Meta Platforms followed Snap lower, falling 7% in the premarket, while Pinterest lost 14%.
*****
> ‚ÄúStocks are getting hit hard this morning and the main culprit is the Snap warning from Monday evening,‚Äù wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. ‚ÄúSome are a bit incredulous that a relatively small and perennially unprofitable ephemeral social media firm can take down the whole tape, but given how sensitive this tape is, SNAP is able to punch above its weight.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúTech still dominates the market, both numerically (it remains the biggest weighting) and psychologically, and despite aggressive liquidation in the last couple of months, people still own a lot of it,‚Äù he added.
*****
> Shares of major tech companies reliant on advertising spend followed Snap lower. Alphabet slid 4%. Amazon fell 2% and Apple and Netflix were each down more than 1%.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,‚Äù wrote Morgan Stanley analysts after the Snap warning. ‚ÄúAdvertising is cyclical.‚Äù
*****
> Meanwhile, Zoom Video shares popped 6% after the company issued strong guidance for the second quarter.
*****
> Retail earnings continue this week and investors are eager to see how high inflation is affecting consumer demand, and if last week‚Äôs disappointments from big box retailers were company specific or reflections of the whole sector.
*****
> On Tuesday shares of apparel maker Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 10% premarket after reporting that freight and product costs weighed on sales for the fiscal first quarter. Best Buy shares initially popped after the company reported a mixed quarter, but reversed, and last traded 2% lower. Retailers were among the top gainers in the S&P 500 Monday.
*****
> The moves came a day after the market staged a rebound from last week‚Äôs steep market sell-off, which saw the Dow hit its first eight-week losing streak since 1923, and the S&P 500 briefly fall into bear market territory on an intraday basis.
*****
> Stocks rallied during Monday‚Äôs regular trading session as the Dow jumped 618 points, or nearly 2%, following a week of sharp losses. The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The moves left investors wondering whether the bounce can hold or if it was yet another minor relief rally amid the relentless sell-off that has yet to reach a bottom.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis kind of environment where you‚Äôve got the whipsaw and ups and downs that are so big is a trading environment where it can feel on any given day like you were wrong yesterday and that is ripe for mistakes,‚Äù Sofi‚Äôs head of investment strategy Liz Young told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù
*****
> Investors are looking ahead to new home sales and a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development summit on Tuesday. Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren are also slated to report earnings.

Relatively new to stock markets and investment in general. 

Every month I buy a few stocks and ETFs.

2 days ago, I read about the LUNA crypto debacle, and I told myself: I'm building something for the long term, and I know what I'm buying. Or so I thought.

  
What am I buying exactly though?

For stocks that pay dividends, I'm buying potential future ""salaries"" based on earnings. 

  
But for the other stocks and specifically ETFs, is that just an expansive paper that I hope more people will want in the future? Since I don't care for the ""voting right"" that comes with them.

How different is that from a pyramid scheme or crypto speculation? Worthless in itself, just hoping for demand to increase.",1653429780.0

Please let me know if anything is not accurate, and any feedback whatsoever is greatly appreciated. 

&#x200B;

**5 reasons the markets are on a tear, is due to being driven by of worries about:**

1. rising interest rate hikes through 2022 and the Fed's monetary tightening 
2. slowing economic and earnings growth (Growth was negative for the U.S. in the first quarter)
3. the ongoing war in Ukraine 
4. a slowdown in China‚Äôs economy due to new COVID lockdowns 
5. high inflation (both domestically and globally) 

**These¬†5 drivers have led to:**

1. higher commodity prices worldwide  
2. worries around supply-chain issues (which will continue)

&#x200B;

**Please note:**

Historically, the Fed raising interest rates have often led to a recession. One of the best indicators of a recession, is the stock market itself. This sort of a drop in markets can signal that a recession is coming.¬†  

* The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 stocks of mostly the largest U.S. companies. It‚Äôs a barometer of the health of corporate America and is considered one of leading indicators of the U.S. economy.¬†  

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis/ Conclusion:**

I believe, the Stock Market drop will continue until there's enough economic data to prove that inflation is under control. Emotions are driving the markets right now, and human emotions are a difficult thing to predict.¬† Expect volatility ahead.",1653331987.0

While the output from the mining and utilities sectors increased, manufacturing output declined by 4.6%. The auto and equipment-manufacturing sectors have been worst affected by these lockdowns ‚Äî resulting in even more shortages around the world.
 
Unemployment rates in major cities also rose, which contributed to the drop in retail sales. Economists are now lowering their forecasts for China‚Äôs economic growth for the year, with some saying they believe the economy may already be entering a recession. 
 
The interruption to manufacturing is also affecting global companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  and Toyota (NYSE:TM), who have manufacturing operations in China. Foreign companies are now reducing their investments in China, and some are even considering relocating their operations elsewhere, according to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Besides the Covid-related lockdowns, businesses are also concerned about geo-political issues and China‚Äôs close relationship with Russia.

There is some kind of guarantee for having chosen a company with great fundamentals and so the A stocks owner is protected in some ways? If yes in which way he is protected?

I'm not trying to buy a full share of Amazon, Apple or Tesla quite just yet but would like buy into those companies. I also may want to buy Netflix because it is still a pretty good streaming company that sells at a discount now.

However, my bank account software requires you to buy full shares only.  This is so stupid.  I don't want to allocate my risk by such an arbitrary determination as the stock's price. By buying partial shares, I can allocate risk on a percentage basis.. This is so obvious I'm just explaining further to hit the minimum character count.

What is the easiest, lowest fee service that can let you buy partial stocks and connect to a major bank account pretty easily to move money to and from?

356,My entire investing philosophy in 10 bullet points,74,uv9ohk,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uv9ohk/my_entire_investing_philosophy_in_10_bullet_points/,9,"From Barry Ritholtz: 

1. **Stock picking is exceedingly difficult**: The academic data overwhelmingly demonstrates that the vast majority of Alphas chasers underperform the indices after a few years. After 10 years net of fees, there are practically zero outperformers. And that is just buying ‚Äì selling is even harder, and stock pickers are terrible at it. We know the names of people like Ron Baron and Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett not because they are typical stock pickers, but because they are the rare outliers.

2. **Market Timing is even harder**: There are many reasons why, but perhaps the most compelling is that the biggest up and down days tend to be clustered near each other. Overbought conditions lead to sell-offs aka (lol) profit-taking; oversold conditions lead to snapback rallies, but the long-term trend is where actual capital gets compounded.

3. **We are oblivious to our own cognitive shortcomings**: Just as most drivers believe they are above-average, so too do most investors believe they can generate alpha. We are over-confident, imagine we can ofrecast the future, and generally have a high opinion of ourselves. We cannot distinguish between outcomes that are the result of luck or skill. Other managers that do well? That‚Äôs due to their lucky breaks, but our own great trades / market calls are obviously due to our own brilliance.

4. **Behavior is the biggest determiner of investor returns**. This is the most important point I hope to make today: Do you chase the hot stocks or managers during bull runs? Do you panic and sell during volatility? How investors behave has an enormous impact on their long-term returns ‚Äì far greater than either stock picking or market timing.

5. **Consistent average returns turn into above-average returns over time**. Howard Marks has discussed why typical managers who finish in the top 10% in any given year underperform over the long haul. They tend to be narrow and specific, and their sector/style/region goes in and out of favor. Bouncing between the top and bottom deciles is not a formula for long-term performance. Instead, consistently achieving a modest target in the middle will eventually turn in top quartile returns (or better).

6. **Don‚Äôt overlook tax alpha: For non-qualified accounts** ‚Äì not 401ks, IRAs, endowments, or philanthropies ‚Äì managing around your capital gains can lead to enormous improvements in net after-tax returns. Approaches like direct indexing, asset location, and appreciated stock sale planning can yield substantial savings. And, they are risk-free.

7. **Fees matter a lot**: There can be no doubt that high fees are a drag on long-term performance. We do everything possible to lower costs to clients. The obvious and easy thing to do is we use managers like Vanguard, DFA, and Blackrock which are the cheapest in their class for mutual funds and ETFs. But we also do several things with our own RIA fees: Our Milestone Rewards cuts fees by 15% for clients who create and regularly review their financial plan and exhibit good financial behavior. And, we offer a robo-advisor that comes with a dedicated human advisor at less than half of our regular fees.

8. **Use Tactical portfolios tactically**: Goaltender is our tactical portfolio, and it is the only such vehicle I am aware of that refuses to suggest outperformance as a goal. But it serves a vital part of an investor‚Äôs plan: It keeps their ‚Äúreal money‚Äù fully invested while allowing the investor to feel like they did something as opposed to nothing. This acts as an enormous emotional relief valve.

9. **Financial literacy requires constant refreshers**: Studies have shown that the half-life on financial literacy is quite low. Thus, if you want your clients to understand why you are not picking stocks or market timing, and why you are willing to ride out volatility and drawdowns, you must constantly reinforce the data on this. RWM uses blog posts, podcasts, videos, clients letter, and quarterly conference calls all to reinforce these key notions above.

10. **Investing is simple, but hard**: Nothing on the list is overly complex or impossible to achieve. None of these things require extraordinary skills or ability. But they are difficult to perform consistently, over long stretches of time, without occasionally messing up. The best investment strategy for you is the one you‚Äôre likely to stick with. Achieving this requires dedication and commitment, something most of occasionally find ourselves lacking.",1653221362.0

358,Is the S&P 500 bottoming out? Technical analysis suggests the worst is over,0,uvznt7,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uvznt7/is_the_sp_500_bottoming_out_technical_analysis/,34,"The S&P 500 fell to the brink of a bear market last week, with cumulative losses of more than $1 trillion. Looking ahead, the latest analysis from Larry Williams, a veteran Wall Street technical analyst who predicted a stock market bottom in 2020, shows that he expects a market bottom to be forming. Jim Cramer of CNBC explained his analysis in more detail on Friday.

""I know it's hard to believe anything positive at this point, but I said the same thing in April 2020 when Larry Williams made one of the best bottom predictions I've ever seen."" Mad Money host said. ""I wouldn't bet against him. I believe his predictions outweigh my contempt for this market."" Cramer began his explanation of Williams' analysis by overlaying the S&P 500 futures trend with the following indicators.

**First, the ADL indicator suggests that the worst of this market drop may be over**

https://preview.redd.it/ems84u0l38191.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d34494603ad1ab44fd6c2a6e245035850b119a8

The first indicator to be used is the Advance/Decline Line, also known as the Advance/Decline Indicator (ADL for short), represented by the blue line. This indicator is a cumulative value obtained by subtracting the number of stocks that rose from the number of stocks that fell, and then adding the difference to the previous value of the indicator. Williams sees the advance/decline line indicator as a measure of the strength/weakness of momentum within the market.

In addition, the black root candlestick (a candlestick style) represents the trend of S&P 500 futures. The trends of the two are superimposed on one chart.

‚ÄúRight now, you can see that while S&P 500 futures have been a mess last week, the ADL indicator is holding up pretty well. To be precise, it‚Äôs steadily moving higher.‚Äù

Cramer points out that when an important indicator and an index move in opposite directions, the pattern is called a divergence (in this case the indicator shows a bullish divergence). Cramer said, ""According to Williams, the performance of the up/down line indicator here is a very positive signal for the market (here, the benchmark S&P 500 futures). It tells you that, in broad terms, this decline is The worst may be over.""

**Second, the volume balance indicator suggests sell-side volume is starting to dry up**

https://preview.redd.it/4733g38s38191.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3d692fc8bc541cf2f45de5ec07f17dc9a3700c7

The second indicator used is the on-balance volume index, represented by the purple line. This indicator is a cumulative value obtained by subtracting the volume of declining stocks from the volume of advancing stocks, and then adding the difference to the previous value of the indicator.

Cramer superimposed the indicator and the daily chart of S&P 500 futures into a single chart. Cramer explained, ‚ÄúWe care about this because volume is like a lie detector test for technicians: high volume tells the truth. Low volume moves tend to be misleading.‚Äù

Cramer noted that despite the S&P 500 hitting new lows, the volume balance indicator remained unchanged, and the chart was in line with what Williams would expect ""in a falling market"" -- that some major fund managers are finally starting to buy more aggressively into the stock.

**Third, despite the market drop, professionals are buying, and a rebound may be brewing**

https://preview.redd.it/lxgpjq7348191.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83141354ac32fb885b572049ec8263d8ca5d0291

The third indicator mentioned is Williams' insider activity indicator, which Cramer superimposed on a single chart with the daily chart of S&P 500 futures. ""Look at the bottom of the chart, which is Williams' Trader Commitment Index, which shows what professional money managers do with their futures positions.""

""While the market is down and Williams sees the pros buying here, that tends to make for a major rally,"" Cramer said.

Williams looks at the dominant cycle for the S&P 500, which is typically 75 days, as shown below. ""Right now, the cycle shows that the S&P is ready to rise... If the cycle holds up, Williams expects it to run until mid-to-late June,"" Cramer said.

https://preview.redd.it/i08inld848191.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=445d6f09aca974097959fcbcc2cc127b11f4e02b

Still, despite technical analysis suggesting that the market may be bottoming, Wall Street remains bearish. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at Tastytrade Inc., both cautioned against trying to time the market in recent interviews.

Kinahan believes that any attempt to pick the bottom is ""dumb."" Christopher said that with the market hitting new lows, investors may consider putting a small amount of cash into the market and buying quality stocks to cut losses.

There are even many investors who continue to be bearish on the stock market this year. According to Bloomberg, people involved in the latest MLIV Pulse survey believe the S&P 500 will fall further. According to the median forecast of 1,009 respondents, the S&P 500 is likely to continue its decline this year, possibly bottoming out at around 3,500 -- meaning the index could be down at least 10% from Friday's close of 3,901. It is down 27% from its January high.

I‚Äôve worked an an engineer at a few well-known companies, then like many do I decided to take a chance on a startup-ish company as of late.

When I started last year, it was all sunshine and roses. SPACs were SPAC-ing, funds were being raised, hiring was on a tear. Then all of a sudden about a month ago everyone seems to have seen a ghost. Market pullback, hiring freezes, rescinded offers, layoffs abound. None of this is news to anyone here, but perhaps it hasn‚Äôt been conveyed how sudden all this felt for (ignorant?) people in my position.

So with that said‚Äî We‚Äôve known inflation is on the rise, we knew JPow was going to hike rates, we knew China has a ridiculous Covid policy, we knew Russia was going to attack Ukraine, etc. Nothing has really come out of left field. So why is this only really coming to a head now? Why did so many early stage companies go from rapid hiring to headcount reductions? Why are entities like y-combinator basically saying everyone is screwed, when months ago runways looked long and clear?

But are there other indicators that have unexpectedly changed in recent weeks that have caused the complete 180 in sentiment? Is it the lockdown + stimulus in China that will almost definitely keep inflation running hot? Is it Russia‚Äòa disruption of the oil supply chain? Maybe we just didn‚Äôt expect all these things to stack up.

Anyway I‚Äôm interested to get other thoughts on this. How will history view the events of 2022? How would we warn future generations so they don‚Äôt repeat our mistakes (like that ever works)? Will this situation drive new regulations, or even destabilize parts of the world?",1653169377.0

First lets define timing the market. I 100% agree that NO ONE can time it to the exact top/bottom, but that doesnt mean no one can time a good exit or entry. 

Ill use myself as an example. I have been a trader for quite a while. I was long QQQ up until January 2022. Since mid 2021, I have a sense that market is overvalued and we are due for some correction. But I DID NOT know when, so I stayed long. I have been using my indicators to tell me when the trend is likely over. One day mid Jan, both SPY and QQQ signaled me to exit. I immediately sold all my long positions (about 5% from the highs) and bought SQQQ (3 times leveraged short). Did I nail the top? Nope! Did I successfully avoided a 25%-50% loss in my account? Absolutely.

My portfolio YTD is +60% believe it or not. I am waiting for a re-entry to establish my long position. I WON'T nail the bottom, but that doesn't mean i cant time a good entry.

Here is my post from a few weeks ago. Please see if the things I said make sense:

""[Apr 30] So when will it be over? When people dont even want to own big caps and stay in cash, thats when there is no sellers left. We are seeing FB, N, AMZN, GOOG starting to sell off recently. AAPL, TSLA, MSFT are holding relatively well. Until these giants give in, I dont think we have reach a bottom yet.

I have a target of QQQ near 285 when I start to DCA. Current holding SQQQ and weekly covered calls. Portfolio up 40% YTD. 7 years as a trader, if it means anything.""

So far I am quite on point and Apple have recently ""give in"" and sold off. I can't say we have bottomed but I am comfortable DCA in at this point, with some hedging.

im asking that because as far as im concerned, its less a question of ""if"", but rather of ""when"" will the next pandemic happen. in addition, we do know that everything as well as economy will change extremely fast in the not so far future.

just a couple of thoughts i had to share before i figure out if i should dedicate some more time to considering if i should actually learn and go deeper in the world of investments. i must mention though, if im going learn this, im probably going to invest only in specific cases. ones which have extreme positive potential and have unusually low risk, like a new serious pandamic. thats because i think you have to be a real expert in investing if you want to regulerly make decent money out of it, and i dont think that is the kind of i want to do in my life.",1653208691.0

I have read that ROCE = Net Profit/(Total Equity + Long Term Debt) and ROE = Net Profit/Total Equity.

And I have also read that ROCE being greater than ROE means that company is servicing it's debt at the cost of equity shareholders. That makes sense from the formulas above.

So, how can ROCE be much greater than ROE in companies with zero Debt to Equity ratio? Consider two Indian companies: ITC and HUL. Below are the financials of both companies:

I'm a newbie investor, I want to form a superb **dividend income portfolio for years and years**. First I was looking at ETFs like **VYM**, **VNQ**, **SCHD**, etc. But then, after some time of more deep research, I realised that there are more profitable alternatives, it calls derivative income (here I'm not sure 100% that I'm correct since I'm a newbie)‚Äîfor example, **QYLD**, **RYLD**, **JEPI**.

As I understand, such funds trade on options. They have very attractive **dividend yield**. Let's take a look.

**QYLD:** 

`Expense Ratio: 0.60%`

`Div Frequency: Monthly`

`Div Rate (FWD): $2.46`

`Yield (FWD): 13.88%`

`Assets (AUM): $5.79B`

**RYLD:**

`Expense Ratio: 0.60%`

`Div Frequency: Monthly`

`Div Rate (TTM): $2.98`

`Yield (TTM): 14.24%`

`Assets (AUM): $1.00B`

**JEPI:**

`Expense Ratio: 0.35%`

`Div Frequency: Monthly`

`Div Rate (TTM): $4.76`

`Yield (TTM): 8.52%`

`Assets (AUM): $3.88B`

Such funds have 2-4 stars on **Morning Star** and significant **AUM**. Some obstacles that I see:

\- all such funds are **young** (only 2-3 years)  
\- if don't take into account dividends, they have had **negative performance** since their inception

So, I'm wondering if such funds are a good choice for a **long-term income portfolio**? Thanks in advance!",1653154540.0

# **Stocks head for another potentially treacherous week, as a slew of retailers report earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/20/stocks-head-for-another-potentially-treacherous-week-after-sp-500-falls-into-bear-market-territory.html)**
*****
> If there‚Äôs more bad news from retailers in the coming week, that could be a negative catalyst for an already cranky stock market.
*****
> Market pros are watching for more signs that stocks could be bottoming, though strategists say that is a tricky prospect and there could be false signals.
*****
> The S&P 500, on an intraday basis Friday, broke through its prior low to reach bear market levels - trading more than 20% below its record high reached in January. But it did not close there. Instead, it reversed the day‚Äôs steep losses and ended the day just slightly positive.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt is a process. ... This week was scary in breaking through last week‚Äôs bottom. These things take time,‚Äù said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI.
*****
> Emanuel said that taking out the lows could signal a buying opportunity, and that the market is in a bottoming process. ‚ÄúLooking medium to longer term, toward the end of the year, we continue to see higher stock prices ahead,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Stocks were lower in the past week, despite the fact strategists had been expecting the oversold market to bounce. The market initially rallied, until earnings misses from Walmart and Target blew up the gains.
*****
> The surprising weakness in those two big stalwart retailers crushed their stocks, hammered the retail sector and took the entire market lower on fears the consumer is wobbling and other companies will also have earnings issues.
*****
> Earnings from Costco, Best Buy and others, as well as personal consumption expenditures data, could be important in the coming week as investors weigh how much the consumer is stumbling. The PCE includes data on spending, income and inflation.
*****
> The S&P 500 Friday dipped into bear market territory when it fell under 3,837.24, but did not close there. Some Wall Street pros consider it a bear market if a 20% decline is reached in an index on an intraday basis, but others insist the index must close at that level in order for the bear market to be effective.
*****
> Regardless, it‚Äôs the biggest downturn of this magnitude since the swift bear market decline in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is another step in the bottoming process, but we‚Äôre going to need follow through. You‚Äôre getting a slew of retailers reporting next week ‚Äì the place that is under the largest microscope of investors, given the blowups we saw this week,‚Äù said Emanuel. ‚ÄúIt will be absolutely vital for the broad market to respond in a positive fashion to whatever those retailers report.‚Äù
*****
> While there is no official determination on what a bear market is, strategists so agree that the extent of the bear market, or how far stocks could fall, depends strictly on the performance of the economy.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe whole thing comes down to whether or not there‚Äôs going to be a recession. In the last three bear markets, where there was no recession, the decline was 21.3% and we‚Äôre basically there,‚Äù Emanuel said.In the last three bear markets when there as a recession, the average decline was 47.9%, he said. Those bear markets were in 2000, 2008 and 2020.
*****
> Other retailers reporting earnings in the coming week include Ulta Beauty, Macy‚Äôs, Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, and discounters Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Their reports and comments could help clarify whether the consumer is more broadly weakening, and how much inflation and supply chain snarls continue to hurt the stores and the economy.
*****
> ‚ÄúAny retailer reporting in this environment is a reason for an investor to be fearful, given what we‚Äôve seen this week,‚Äù Emanuel said.
*****
> The reports from Walmart and Target came as the market was also assessing a very strong April retail sales report, showing spending jumped 8.2% year over year.
*****
> In the coming week, the economic calendar includes the Federal Reserve‚Äôs minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday, the second look at first quarter gross domestic product Thursday, as well as PCE data on Friday. The PCE data also includes the PCE inflation index, watched closely by the Fed.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre likely to shift gears to focus on economic data. We get the April read on new home sales, which looks to be down but not as much as it was in April,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ‚ÄúWe get durable goods, and that‚Äôs likely to show improvement as well. One thing that‚Äôs been consistent is the data and the economic calendar has been better than the market‚Äôs reaction to it.‚Äù
*****
> Stocks took a battering in the past week, with the S&P 500 down 3% to 3,901. The Nasdaq was bloodied even more, declining 3.8% as some big cap tech favorites cratered. Apple was down 6.4% on the week, and Tesla fell 13.7%.
*****
> Emanuel said investors should continue to stay defensive. ‚ÄúThis is an environment where you have to look for all the edges you can, which is projected better earnings growth, depressed multiples and high short interest,‚Äù he said. When a stock has a high short position, meaning investors expect the price to fall, any move higher in price could force those investors to cover shorts, propelling the stock price to even better gains.
*****
> Emanuel said he also likes value names. ‚ÄúLong term, it‚Äôs a very very viable area of the market,‚Äù he said. Emanuel added that value stocks are under-owned by individuals, and he said the are a hedge in a rising rate environment and also against inflation.

> # SSmall Caps Best Week Before Memorial Day

> With market logging its 7th straight weekly loss in a row, prospects have dimmed for the usually quiet trading during the week before Memorial Day. In the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, we show how the market trades around Memorial Day.

> In the table below we went back to 1971, the year the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect, moving Memorial Day and most other federal holidays to Monday. In recent years, the Friday before Memorial has become getaway day on The Street and volume is often diminished and trading uninspired.

> DJIA is the weakest in the week before Memorial Day up 26 of the past 51 years and a paltry 0.01% average gain. S&P is a bit better, up 62.7% of the time with an average gain of 0.2%. NASDAQ is up 64.7% of the time, averaging a gain of 0.29%. But the Russell 2000 small caps take the lead ahead of the official kick-off to summer up 74.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.6%.

> But with the market getting hammered the last 7 weeks straight, NASDAQ already in bear market territory and S&P on the brink it is hard to get bullish on the market even for pre-holiday inspired trading. Our weekly losing streak study from last week does show a short pop across the board when these losing streaks end ‚Äì but they have to end.

> # Stocks Below Pre-COVID Highs

> Last week, we outlined the percentage of stocks in each S&P 500 sector that had fallen below their pre-COVID highs to show that many of the stocks that surged due to pandemic effects have significantly fallen off, netting long-term holders a negative return since the onslaught of the pandemic. (Read it here.) Yesterday, the S&P 500 fell by over four percent to set a new 52 week low, breaking the 4,000 level. The index is still up over 15% relative to its pre-COVID high, but as of yesterday's close, 41.2% of S&P 500 members were below their respective pre-COVID highs, as 26 members crossed below this critical level yesterday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/pct.png))**

> Notably, six of the 32 S&P 500 consumer staples stocks crossed below, moving the percentage from 28.1% to 46.9% on the back of weak earnings reports from Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). 66.7% of Communication Services stocks and 60.0% of Real Estate stocks in the S&P 500 are below their pre-COVID highs, but only 18.5% and 23.8% of Materials and Energy stocks are below this level, respectively. Additionally, 8.2% of S&P 500 members were within 5% of their pre-COVID highs, and 15.1% are within 10%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/SP-500-stocks-below-pre-covid-highs-051822.png))**

> Four S&P 500 stocks crossed below this critical level for the first time in a while yesterday: Cognizant Technology (CTSH), MGM Resorts (MGM), Tyler Tech (TYL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK). This comes amidst weakness in the Technology sector (XLK) versus the broader S&P 500, as the sector is down close to 25% on a YTD basis versus the S&P 500's drawdown of about 18%. However, XLK is still up close to 30% relative to pre-COVID highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/Stocks-that-broke-pre-covid-highs-051822.png))**

> Additionally, there are three stocks that entered a 2% channel above their pre-COVID highs for the first time in a while. Dexcom (DXCM) entered the channel amidst weakness in the broader energy space, and Pentair (PNR) extended the downtrend that is yet to break. Walmart (WMT) sold off significantly in two consecutive days after a weak earnings report and is now less than 1% from its pre-COVID high. A month ago WMT was 30% above this level.

> # Post-COVID Gains for Small-Cap Growth Go Poof!

> Growth stocks outperformed value stocks by a wide margin in the years leading up to the pandemic. Growth also outperformed value in the first ~18 months after the pandemic, but that trend has been flipped on its head since late 2021. You can see the recent convergence between growth and value in the chart below. Entering 2022, the S&P 500 Growth index was outperforming the S&P 500 Value index by ~40 percentage points since the pre-COVID high for the stock market in February 2020. Now, Growth is only outperforming Value by ~8 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/spxgv.png))**

> The shift from growth to value has been even more dramatic in the more economically sensitive small-cap space. Remarkably, the Russell 2,000 Growth index is now DOWN 6% on a total return basis since the pre-COVID peak for stocks on 2/19/20. Six months ago, this index was still up 45% from its pre-COVID high.

> Fed Chair Powell first shifted to a tighter monetary stance in November 2021. In just six months since Powell's pivot, we've seen the entire post-COVID bull market for small-caps give up its gains and then some. And this doesn't even factor in a double-digit percentage point increase in inflation since COVID began that pushes ""real"" returns for the Russell 2,000 Growth index much deeper into negative territory.

> # Retail Roiled

> Reactions to the biggest retailer earnings have generally been abysmal this season. Today, Target (TGT) is following in the footsteps of Walmart (WMT) with its worst single-day reaction to earnings on record according to the data in our Earnings Explorer and its worst day overall since the 1987 crash. Given the two are some of the largest publically traded retailers, broad measures of the space are plummeting. As shown below, the VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) is down nearly 7% which puts it on pace for its third-worst day since it began trading in 2011. The only two worse days were in March 2020. Similarly, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)‚Äîwhich has both a longer history and a different weighting methodology (equal-weighted)‚Äîis down an even more dramatic 8.73% as of this writing. That is on pace to be the seventh-worst day on record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051822-Retail.png))**

> Of course, there are many different niches in the retail space meaning some areas have held up better than others. Below we show the relative strength lines since the start of 2020 for various S&P 1500 retail sub-industry indices versus the broad market (S&P 1500). The charts are sorted from left to right and top to bottom by largest to smallest market caps.

> By far the most striking decline has been the General Merchandise Stores industry which includes names like Walmart and Target. That line essentially shows the group has lost any and all outperformance versus the broader market since the spring of 2020. The relative strength line of specialty stores has also fallen dramatically to the lowest level in over a year. While those brick-and-mortar giants have gotten crushed, the same can be said for internet-based retail, but the drop in this industry actually happened ahead of these others.

> Within retail, there are also a couple of pockets that have held up well. For example, Home Improvement Retail is comprised of stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), and that line is still roughly in its uptrend of the past month and the same goes for Automotive retail in spite of its pullback. The only one making a considerable move higher today is apparel retail. However, the entirety of that move is thanks to TJX Companies (TJX) which is the only stock of the 19 in the industry that is trading higher on the day; TJX is rallying 7.87% on earnings.

> # Six Things To Know About Bear Markets

> It has been a historically bad year so far for stocks, with many names in bear markets. Thus far though, the S&P 500 Index has avoided a bear market (classified as a 20% decline from recent highs), as it was down 18.1% as of last week.

> Here are six things to know regarding bear markets.

> 1) There have been 17 bear (or near bear markets) since World War II. The average drop was nearly 30% and lasted nearly a full year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-chart-1.png))**

> 2) Breaking down bear markets with recessions and without recessions shows an interesting development. Should the economy be in a recession, the bear markets get worse, down 34.8% on average and lasting nearly 15 months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-3.png))**

> 3) Whereas as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, should the economy avoid a recession, the bear market bottoms at 23.8% and lasts just over seven months on average. Even more interesting is we‚Äôve seen multiple near bear markets bottom near 19%, close to where stocks bottomed last week.

> ‚ÄúGoing back more than 50 years shows that only once was there a bear market without a recession that lost more than 20% and that was during the Crash of 1987,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWith other near bear markets without a recession bottoming near 19% corrections in 1978, 1998, 2011, and 2018, not far from the recent lows.‚Äù

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-3.png))**

> 4) Midterm years can be quite volatile with the average year down 17.1% peak to trough, so a bear market during this year isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary. Knowing that helps put this year‚Äôs drop of 18.1% in perspective. The good news is a year off those lows, the S&P 500 has gained 32.0% on average, something most investors would likely take right about now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-5.png))**

> 5) Here are the fastest bear markets ever. Not surprisingly, the pandemic related bear market of March 2020 was the fastest ever, going from a new high to down 20% in only 16 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Blog-5-1.png))**

> 6) This is the third year of the current bull market and the third year tends to see somewhat muted returns, up barely 5% on average. In fact, there have been 11 bull markets since World War II and three of them ended during their third year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/blog-6.jpg))**

> So those are six things to know about bear markets. Lastly, speaking of six, the S&P 500 is down six weeks in a row currently, the longest losing streak since 2011. It hasn‚Äôt been down seven in a row since 2001. What stands out about this data is if the six week losing streak is down more than 10% (like this one was), then the future returns can be quite strong. Up a median of 9.9% six months later and 29.2% a year later.

> # Expect More May Market Volatility

> May has delivered much more than its usual market volatility. Stocks rallied strongly out of the blocks. NASDAQ jumped 3.2% on the third trading day, May 4, up 5.1% for the month. Then the bottom fell out. NASDAQ dropped 12.3% over the next five trading days. Bargain hunting came in over the past four days rallying NASDAQ 5.5%. In the chart here we have put 2022 on the right scale to highlight the trend since the moves in May 2022 have been about 10x the historical average. As you can see despite the increased volatility this year stocks have tracked the typical May Seasonal Trend rather closely. The market is still negative for the month. But if the trend continues the market has a good shot to turn positive for May. But many support levels have been broken and this appears to be a bear market rally.

> # Homebuilders Sentiment Free Fall

> Although material cost pressures have shown some signs of alleviating (for example lumber and copper futures have been grinding lower), the cost to finance a home has only increased with the national average of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovering around 5.5%. That higher cost dampens demand, and homebuilder sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. The NAHB's Housing Market Index fell from a top 5% reading of 77 last month all the way down to a new 52-week low of 69 this month. The index has been rolling over for some time now after peaking all the way back in November 2020, and the 8 point month over month decline in May is the worst of that span, ranking as the fourth largest monthly decline in the history of the index. Two of those larger declines came in the midst of recessions/major economic shocks‚ÄîOctober 2001 (9/11) and April 2020 (start of the pandemic). The other largest drop was in February 2014.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/05/051722-NAHB1.png))**

> The big drop in the headline index points to a notable deterioration in reported conditions and similar drops were shared across the sub-indices. Present sales remain the most elevated with its reading of 78 managing to stay in the top decile of its historical range, but just barely so as the 8-point m/m decline also ranks as one of the largest on record. Even though reported sales are holding up decently (albeit far from improving), sentiment for future sales has collapsed. After a double-digit decline this month, the index is below its historical median meaning homebuilders are anticipating activity to slowdown in the coming months. One likely reason is that overall traffic has pulled back sharply. The 9-point month-over-month drop is tied for the second-largest decline on record.

> From a geographic standpoint, this month was interesting. As with the national indices, the Midwest and West saw some of the sharpest activity pullbacks in the history of the survey. Those indices are now around similar levels to the spring of 2020. For the South, the decline did not result in an outright collapse below the post-pandemic range, but nonetheless, the decline was enormous by historic standards.

> Then there's the Northeast. While the rest of the country experienced sharp pullbacks, the Northeast index actually rose by 2 points to 76. Although the level remains middling versus its post-pandemic range, it is a notable divergence compared to the rest of the country.

> In spite of the report on homebuilder sentiment, homebuilder stocks, as proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), are actually higher alongside the rest of the market, currently up 1.3%. Those gains on top of the past few days' rally appear more technical in nature than any sort of improvement in the overall backdrop for the space. As shown below, the group has been hit hard this year as mortgage rates have soared. Hardly at any point this year has the group managed to trade above its moving averages.

The reason why Shell sold this extremely profitably refinery is because they are shrinking its refining and chemicals portfolio as part of a broader shift by oil majors to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and shift to lower-carbon fuels.

On April 1, 2022, Shell has completed the sale of its Chemical LP Refinery in Mobile, Alabama, to Vertex Energy Operating LLC (Vertex Energy), for $75 million in cash plus the value of the hydrocarbon inventory and other closing adjustments and accrued liabilities. This mobile refinery is generating 90,000 barrels-per-day (bpd). Vertex plans to produce approximately 10,000 bpd of renewable diesel and renewable byproducts at the plant by the end of 2022, increasing to 14,000 bpd by 2023.

In their Q1 report Vertex gave an update on the performance of the mobile refinery: 

Operating near peak utilization in support of strong regional demand. The Mobile refinery operated at 90% of planned utilization in April 2022, given operable capacity of 75,000 barrels per day. The Company anticipates that the Mobile refinery will operate at approximately 90% of operable capacity for the duration of the second quarter 2022, given current market conditions. the mobile refinery.

They also provided financial guidance on 2022. For the full-year 2022, Vertex currently anticipates:

¬∑ Gross Profit in a range of $440 million to $460 million

¬∑ Adjusted Net Income in a range of $235 million to $255 million

¬∑ Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $340 million to $360 million

¬∑ Adjusted Free Cash Flow in a range of $150 million to $175 million

This has to be the most undervalued stock I have found. Sitting at a market cap of below 1bln this stock has insane upside potential. Vertex is a opportunity that comes by once in a time.

As long-term investors, we always look for fundamental data and growth possibilities. The P/E Ratio helps us to understand the overall valuation of the S&P 500 Index.

By comparing S&P 500 PE ratio with historical data, we can understand how the US Market is priced compared to history. It also helps us identify the right time to buy stocks to make good returns. 

The S&P 500 Average PE Ratio is 14-17, which means if the current P/E ratio is near the historical average, then it may be a good time to invest because the market is reasonably priced based on history. On the other hand, if the P/E ratio is higher than the average, it indicates the market may be overpriced or expensive and prices may fall at some level.

**But** that's not the exact point where you can trade based on PE. It depends on market sentiment, your analysis, and fundamental considerations. For example, in the same chart, you can see market prices are reaching their high before the market going to down, and if you are short on that level only based on an expensive market (high price-earnings ratio) you will lose money.

The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio is useful for comparing similar stocks and comparing a company to the market as a whole (S&P500). The current S&P500's P/E ratio is near 25, which is more than 50% above the historical average, suggesting that the market is a little Overvalued.

But for better understanding and minimizing the impact of short-term earnings [volatility,](https://finasko.com/vix-index/) you can also check the Shiller PE ratio, which uses inflation-adjusted 10-year earnings data to make long-term comparisons possible.",1653064620.0

""U.S. may be barreling toward recession in next year, more experts say""

Abha Bhattarai 5/19/2022

The U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the next year, according to growing warnings from banks and economists, as a sudden bout of pessimism hammers financial markets, which on Thursday spiraled further from recent highs.

Although major swaths of the economy ‚Äî including the job market and consumer spending ‚Äî remain robust, there are mounting worries that rising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, after years of near-zero interest rates, could cause a sudden retrenchment. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points so far this year, while officials are signaling more aggressive increases could be necessary to cool the economy. Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.

Financial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the DJIA suffered its worst drop of the year. The S&P 500 inched further into bear market territory (i.e. 20 % drop from the most recent peak ‚Äî after Wednesday‚Äôs sell-off wiped out more than 4 % of its value.

‚ÄúRecession risks are high ‚Äî uncomfortably high ‚Äî and rising,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics. ‚ÄúFor the economy to navigate through without suffering a downturn, we need some very deft policymaking from the Fed and a bit of luck.‚Äù

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday ruled the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) is denying defendants their constitutional  right to a jury trial by putting them in front of its own internal  judges.

In a 2-1 [ruling,](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gkplgzwzlvb/SECURITIES%20REGULATOR%20TRIALS.pdf)  the court ruled for George Jarkesy and Patriot28 LLC, who sued the SEC  in 2011 after the agency imposed a $300,000 fine and other punishments  in a securities fraud case. 

Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote in the majority opinion that the  SEC violated the Seventh Amendment‚Äôs right to a jury trial by bringing  defendants before in-house judges and allowing the agency to ‚Äúact as  both prosecutor and judge.‚Äù

Congress also unconstitutionally delegated power to the SEC to act as a legislative body, Elrod wrote.

‚Äú‚ÄòWe the People‚Äô are the fountainhead of all government power.  Through the Constitution, the people delegated some of that power to the  federal government so that it would protect rights and promote the  common good,‚Äù Elrod said. ‚ÄúBut that accountability evaporates if a  person or entity other than Congress exercises legislative power.‚Äù

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Eugene Davis disagreed, saying the  right to a jury trial did not pertain to administrative proceedings and  that the SEC was enforcing laws and statutes in the public interest.

Davis also said Congress did not overreach in empowering the SEC to enforce action through its administrative proceedings.



The ruling comes two days after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to a  hear a separate but similar case involving the SEC‚Äôs administrative  powers and in-house judges in a suit brought by Texas accountant  Michelle Cochran.

In the 5th Circuit case, Jarkesy created two hedge funds and selected  Patriot28 as an investment adviser. In 2011, the SEC brought action  against Jarkesy and Patriot28, accusing them of overvaluing their  investment fund and misrepresenting data to attract investors.

An administrative law judge within the SEC ruled that Jarkesy and  Patriot28 had committed securities fraud, as did the SEC‚Äôs internal  commission.",1653014394.0

https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/20/20-61007-CV0.pdf

&gt;The SEC brought an enforcement action within the agency against
Petitioners for securities fraud. An SEC administrative law judge adjudged
Petitioners liable and ordered various remedies, and the SEC affirmed on
appeal over several constitutional arguments that Petitioners raised.
Petitioners raise those same arguments before this court. We hold that:
(1) the SEC‚Äôs in-house adjudication of Petitioners‚Äô case violated their
Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial; (2) Congress unconstitutionally
delegated legislative power to the SEC by failing to provide an intelligible
principle by which the SEC would exercise the delegated power, in violation
of Article I‚Äôs vesting of ‚Äúall‚Äù legislative power in Congress; and (3) statutory
removal restrictions on SEC ALJs violate the Take Care Clause of Article II.
Because the agency proceedings below were unconstitutional, we GRANT
the petition for review, VACATE the decision of the SEC, and REMAND
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

So I might make a post in the future about the actual results of this stock strategy, but for now, I want your opinion on this. The point of this strategy is to gain as much money as possible with only one rule: never lose a dime. Well, that may be a bit of an exaggeration but let's get into the strategy itself.

You basically buy a stock(preferably one with a high volatility rate) and put a stop limit just a couple cents under what you bought it for. If the stock goes down at all, you will barely lose anything and if it goes up, gains. I know your typing in right now ""that is stupid, stocks can go down and then go up. In fact the chance the that it will go up without ever crossing below where you bought is low!"" Yes this is very true but the entire point of this is security. For example if you were to buy $99,890.34 worth of apple and you put your stop limit 1 cent under what you bought it fo, at max, you would lose $22. The point is you could put 100k into apple at random and at most lose $22. Is it likely that you will lose the $22, yes but the fact that you are investing 100k into the market when you do win you would win big.

 Now some important things to note: 1. I would not recommend 1 cent below your buying price as your stop limit. I would recommend say 5 cents or maybe even more but I will be seeing how this strategy works and will be seeing what works best. 2. When doing this I would recommend an online brokerage without brokerage fees on each trade. Remember since you will likely be doing this trade a good number of times it is best to have every very small loss to be a very small loss. 3. Again this trade will most likely work with high volatility stocks. The reason why many do not like to trade these kind of stocks are because the loss is big but as long as we have our trusty stop limit that risk gets deleted. 4. This is 100% a short term way to earn money. Why, to free up capital, since you are going to be doing this over and over again you are going to need to pull in and pull out. If the chances are 1/6 that you make gain on this then statistically you should do this as much as possible.

Okay, I am no financially expert and I have even stated that I have never tested this before. Also keep in mind that this is a discussion so I would love to hear everyone's thoughts.",1653098710.0

""The housing market is looking increasingly vulnerable with a price correction possible,"" says one economist.

ING's chief international economist James Knightley points to the rapid rise in home prices making it more challenging for prospective buyers to save for a deposit at a time when inflation is shrinking real incomes and confidence is suffering.

‚ÄúOn top of this, the latest housing data shows that this sector is the most vulnerable to the rising rates environment with the growing prospect of a slowdown and potential correction in coming quarters,‚Äù Knightley wrote in a recent note.

The average mortgage rate for a 30-year conventional loan rose to 5.3% last week. The median cost of a home in April was still at [a record high](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mortgage-rates-people-really-getting-210456678.html) of $391,200,

House prices nationally have increased 35% since the start of the pandemic. Demand in 2020 and 2021 was fueled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and work-from-home options. At the same time, supply has been severely limited with construction slow to catch up.

The tide may be turning now.

Mortgage applications are plunging as borrowing costs are rising. Housing supply is expected to hit the market later this year, when demand is potentially dropping.

‚ÄúHence our belief that the rapid price appreciation of housing could quickly flatten out and possibly reverse,‚Äù writes Knightley.",1652979661.0

There‚Äôs no point beating about the bush here - From Twitter to the mainstream media, everyone‚Äôs talking about the market correction. The S&P 500 saw an 18% drawdown and Nasdaq is down 25% YTD, enough to get investors and traders panicking about the dream bull run ending, and wondering whether we‚Äôre entering a bear market now.

But when emotions are high and anecdotes are used to draw comparisons, there‚Äôs only one recourse - Data. We‚Äôve seen three significant corrections over the last 20 years and studying the market‚Äôs behavior during those corrections can give us clues about what to do. Let‚Äôs dive deep into the previous corrections to understand why this isn‚Äôt the time to panic - And what you should do with your investments now.

## Data

There were three major market corrections in the past - In 2000-02, in 2007-08, and in 2020. I mainly looked at data related to these periods to answer two questions:

1. Should you wait, keep investing, or double down during a dip?
2. Can you protect against downside risk?

I have used the S&P 500 as the benchmark for most of these backtests. The data for this article has been collected using Yahoo Finance. The analysis and data are shared at the end of the article.

## Buying the dip

Markets fluctuate every day. But the reason a drawdown gets everyone‚Äôs attention is that the drop in prices is rapid, and the psychological effect is immense. The 2007-08 correction saw the S&P 500 losing value by more than 50%. Imagine seeing half the value of your portfolio seemingly evaporate overnight!

https://preview.redd.it/tj03wbt698091.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=240a148b5327e60b1037ca6898b9b2ce5a682fca

It‚Äôs very hard to hold on to your investments in such cases. The instinct is to sell at a high and buy at a low. But is it possible to do so reliably? Market timing is a tricky business and it does not work in the long run. \[1\] But in the case of a market correction, ***should you wait out the storm before investing again, or should you double down and buy more?*** Let‚Äôs study the past corrections to find out.

Consider three investors: Cautious Charlie, Average Andy, and Daring Dave. Each of them invests $100 into the S&P 500 at the beginning of every month. When the market goes below 10% of the previous all-time high (let‚Äôs call this the threshold), each investor reacts differently to the dip.

* Cautious Charlie ‚Äúholds‚Äù - He stops investing and waits till the market crosses the threshold again.
* Average Andy ‚Äústays‚Äù - He continues investing as usual.
* Daring Dave ‚Äúdoubles‚Äù - He invests double the usual amount till the market crosses the threshold again.

Who did better? Here‚Äôs how they would have performed if they had started investing in 1998:

https://preview.redd.it/4uvyqtz798091.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde8138d1f036bd208fb2508002d207b078fc6e9

Would you look at that! At the end of 24 years, Average Andy and Daring Dave have returns of greater than 330% while Cautious Charlie has a return of about 240%. The most profitable strategy is to double down during dips, but continuing to invest as usual also does great.

But how do their average returns compare in the short term? These are the average returns if you had invested using the three strategies starting at the beginning of the last three major corrections:

https://preview.redd.it/mynxx1x898091.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7f1e30d02b6b2078e44226c1f36a2b8488965c

Even in the short term, buying during the dip is far superior to waiting \[2\] You would have lost money by waiting but made positive returns over even a 3-year and 5-year period if you had continued to invest - and the profits of the ‚Äúdouble‚Äù strategy are almost 2x that of the ‚Äúhold‚Äù strategy where you stop investing.

The message is clear - Buy the dip if you can afford to.

## Hedging your bets

Sometimes we get so lost in the commotion that we forget to analyze the fundamental reasons behind a correction. A blanket term like a market correction is hard to understand - but looking at how different sectors performed during similar periods in the past can help us find safe bets. This is how each sector performed on average:

https://preview.redd.it/p6ufxmea98091.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=97531102833b5fcdaa1d14872331d5c86a9e9f86

During the last three major drawdowns, semiconductors, tech, and financial stocks were the worst affected. On the other hand, consumer staples, healthcare, and telecom have seen a drawdown much below what the market sees on average. This offers an opportunity - while continuing to invest in the S&P500 is a good strategy, ETFs which invest specifically in these sectors can offer some protection against the downside (The risk of course is that you will miss out on the opportunities that Tech and Growth stocks provide). \[3\]

How you see the market also depends on how you look at it. The S&P500 is just one index out there, and other indices tell a different story. The NASDAQ 100 is a tech-heavy market-cap-weighted index that does not track financial companies. The Russell 2000 tracks 2000 small-cap stocks. The Dow Jones Index is a price-weighted index (unlike the others) that tracks only 30 companies - and it leaves out a lot of big Tech names like Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/m59cr9sc98091.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=a291777f255186995f103e2a84a0a0dc9096d54c

Historically, the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have reacted much more violently to a market correction than the Dow Jones, as the Nasdaq invests heavily in Tech, and the small-cap companies in the Russell 2000 are more susceptible to corrections. Currently, the market might be in the middle of a correction and we don‚Äôt know when it will end - but this is another indicator that investing in non-tech stocks like the Dow Jones Index does is a good way to hedge your bets.

## Should you wait?

>*Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.* \- Warren Buffett

We saw earlier that timing the market is a very unreliable strategy. To push this point further, here‚Äôs a thought experiment: How long would it have taken to double your money in **the worst possible circumstances?** Imagine you had bought into the S&P 500 just before the price dropped and held on without selling or putting in any more money. This is how long you would have had to wait.

https://preview.redd.it/b1v0txie98091.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3f933eb52595debf7424c9cbf23aef218e6613

The worst waiting period was from 2000 to 2006, and even then you would have doubled your money in just 6.72 years! That‚Äôs a return of 10.8% compounded annually. The market bounced back way faster in case of the 2020 correction. The wait feels long because the drop from high to low happens within a year or two on average, and it may take a long time to reach the previous high again - But once the previous high is reached, the market doubles in a little more than half a year on average! Timing the market is a fool‚Äôs errand in this case.

In fact, if you believe that compounding is the key to long-term wealth creation, unnecessarily disturbing your portfolio could cause more harm than good. CNN tracks market sentiment through a metric called ‚Äú[The Fear and Greed Index](https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed)‚Äù. Right now, the index is at an all-time low - indicating that the market is very fearful and it‚Äôs a good time to buy.

https://preview.redd.it/vvq0pgdf98091.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=68cf7cf1a5243c82034d6ea0218f71a2a27b44c7

### Conclusion

Market corrections are psychologically difficult times, and all investing rules go out of the window. It‚Äôs hard to hold on to your stocks when you see them go down, but as the data shows, market corrections of more than 10% are not a time to sell, and rather a time to keep investing or even invest more.

Be clear about the timelines of your investing. Hedge your bets to reduce risk if necessary but consider if it‚Äôs worth interrupting your investment if you don‚Äôt need the money now. If your wealth-building game is long-term and not based on trading, there is little reason to try and time the market. Stay invested, wait for the recovery, and be greedy when others are fearful.

**Footnotes** 

\[1\]

As Nick Maggiuli demonstrates in [this article](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/right-now-but-wrong-later/), rules of thumb like ‚Äúwait for six months before buying into the market‚Äù would have given you a profit after the 2000 and 2007 corrections, but you would have miserably underperformed in the 2010s when the volatility was not as much.

\[2\] The 2020 correction was excluded from 3-year and 5-year returns.

\[3\] There‚Äôs a parallel between the 2000 Dot-com bubble and the correction that‚Äôs happening now, in that Tech and growth stocks are the worst affected even now. But this is not the burst of a bubble unlike 2000 when Amazon was just 6 years old and Facebook didn‚Äôt even exist. What‚Äôs going on? One explanation for the current dip is that the free money that was pumped into the system after the COVID lockdown last year propped up the market to unrealistic levels and now that the Fed rates are kicking in, the market will normalize at a little higher than pre-pandemic levels (Michael Batnick covers this in [his excellent article](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2022/05/13/how-low-can-stocks-go/)).",1652876745.0

They‚Äôre mainly a copper miner.  Copper can be categorized as a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù metal and essential in the context of the energy crisis. I think Sierra Metals looks like a great value play.  

This miner gives strong exposure to copper, which amounts for 41% of their production.  I think energy security is going to be taken with increasing seriousness over the years, and copper will play a central role as governments around the world build their infrastructure.  They have 3 primary S. American mines: Bolivar and Cusi in Mexico, and Yauricocha in Peru.  They‚Äôre currently coming out of an operational turnaround - the COVID pandemic, supply chain issues and resulting staff shortages caused a significant slowdown.  They‚Äôre now on track to meeting their full year guidance.

**Bolivar Mine**

Operations are returning to full production and expected to improve for the remainder of the year.  Most of Sierra‚Äôs employees are now vaccinated at the mine and they‚Äôre working to achieve full vaccination by the end of Q3 2022.  They completed 20,000 meters in exploration drilling, providing access to the northwest zone.  This zone is expected to provide for the bulk of production in the coming quarters

**Cusi Mine**

Sierra Metals Cusi mine produced a 37% increase in silver equivalent production for the quarter.

**Yauricocha Mine**

They discovered a new high-grade zone ‚Äì Fortuna.  Fortuna will be available to mine as early as Q3 2022.  The 8 exploration holes intercepted high-grade copper, zinc and lead zones.

**Inflation Hedge**

Everybody is talking about inflation, high gas prices etc. and is looking for the right hedge in these uncertain times. Sierra Metals provides us with a solid inflation protection revenue mix ‚Äì 93% of their current production comes from copper (41%), silver (28%), zinc (19%) and gold (5%):

**Valuation**

In terms of a quick valuation ‚Äì Sierra Metals trades at a discount vs their peers.  On a forward price to cashflow basis they trade at 1.6x vs small and mid-cap copper peers at 4.4x.  They also have a dividend yield of 3.4%; 2% higher than the dividend yield of the S&P 500.",1652972718.0

&#x200B;

We recently saw a headline that made us ask ‚Äúwhat?!?‚Äù because it said an uptrend in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) had been confirmed. Our take on the market is that not only has the near-term downtrend in the S&P 500 been confirmed but that a major reversal in the market has been confirmed as well. You can blame it on what you want: Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, inflation, supply chain hurdles, rising rates, the FOMC, or the threat of recession and you would be basically right. The reason for the reversal is because of earnings and all of those other factors play into the S&P 500‚Äôs earnings power. We‚Äôve already been tracking a downturn in the outlook for earnings growth, after this week‚Äôs reports from the retail sector we think that trend is going to accelerate and bring the entire market down with it.

&#x200B;

The Technical Picture Is Clear, The S&P 500 Is In A Downtrend

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 has been in a downtrend since hitting the all-time high at the turn of the year. That downtrend was confirmed over the past two weeks when the index broke through a major support level to set a new low and then bounce back to confirm resistance at that level. That level is the 4,100 level and the fall was confirmed by the indicators as well. Both the stochastic and the MACD are showing bearish crossovers that have ample room to run which suggests prices will wallow at current levels or move lower. The scary part of this assessment is that the near-term downtrend is part of a much larger and more powerful price pattern that has also been confirmed.

&#x200B;

We‚Äôve been tracking a reversal in the S&P 500 since early in the year. The index made a push to new highs that was met by selling and broke the uptrend that had been in place since the pandemic bottom in 2020. At that time, the question was, is this a trend change from up to sideways or a full reversal in prices and it looked, at least for a while, as if up to sideways was the answer. The problem now is that a Head & Shoulders Reversal pattern has formed and the break to new lows confirms it as such. Price action rebounded from the new low but, as mentioned before, the rebound met resistance at the 4,100 level which just happens to be the neckline of the pattern.

&#x200B;

Where Does The S&P 500 Go From Here?

&#x200B;

Where the S&P 500 goes from here is a tough call but the trend is definitely downward. The first targets we get are derived from the near-term downtrend. The most recent downtrend began at the 4,550 level and hit support at 4,100 which gives a magnitude of 450. Subtract 450 from 4,100 to get a target near 3,650. That target is coincident with the market consolidation in early 2021 and a viable target for a rebound or bottom to form.

&#x200B;

In the short to mid-term, the index could fall a little further based on the magnitude of the Head & Shoulders Pattern itself. That pattern is worth 700 points in movement and could take the index down to the 3,400 level. 3,400 is coincident with the 2020 top and consolidation so another good target for a rebound, relief rally, or bottom. If that doesn‚Äôt hold, the next target is near the 2,800 level and the long-term uptrend that we‚Äôve been tracking for the last 13 years. It is our opinion that, unless something changes drastically very soon, the S&P 500 will move down to that level.",1652975167.0

Recently I got dividends from Intel with tax rate - **30%**.

And I can't understand why taxes are increased, because 3 months ago I got the same dividends from Intel BUT with tax rate - **15%**...

Check please my screenshot with dividend transactions from Intel.

My broker is Exante. They said that they don't know what happened...

After that I asked directly Intel about this tax rates and they answered - *""Tax laws are different in each jurisdiction.  I recommend contacting a tax accountant in your locality for a determination on your individual situation."".*

**Does anybody know what is going on? Why tax rate are increased?**",1652889418.0
445,How Commodity Cycles Affect our Gains $,2,uskloh,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uskloh/how_commodity_cycles_affect_our_gains/,0,"There‚Äôs been so much talk about the price of gas and the relative attractiveness of resource/commodity stocks.  Sometimes in the excitement, we forget about the downturns and volatility in the market in the past.  The swings in commodity prices over 2020-2021 were damn painful.  The drop in energy prices in 2020 was the steepest of any recession in the past 50 years as well as the recovery.  This was due to a mix of the COVID pandemic, the surge in demand from China and supply chain / labor problems in South America. 

Price discovery (1) in commodities like oil, gas etc. works like this:

Too much oil = crashing prices = less oil in the future

Too little oil = spiking prices=more oil in the future

Price uncertainty is the key difference in a cyclical business, like commodities is different than other industries like retail.  Commodity stocks are good over the long term, but we must pick the lowest cost and best-managed companies.  Consistent profits come from investing in the right stage of the cycle.  The (2) stages in some ways match the business cycle: 1) Recovery 2) Expansion 3) Peak

[Business \/ Commodities Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/nruky0d19a091.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d622da8a49368ea3488a97475e2636cc2c6a7da)

**Recovery**

In this stage, commodity prices and stock price slow their downward movement and begin to stabilize.  Supply growth and capital spending are slowing, so the excess supply of a commodity is no longer increasing.  So, looks are deceiving in this phase because the financial position for a company hasn‚Äôt improved yet but stock prices start to increase off lows.  

Some of the best gains are made here but the risk is great ‚Äì we‚Äôre banking on investing in a company that isn‚Äôt in such bad shape that go bankrupt before the stock can benefit from the rebound.  

**Expansion**

In this stage, there are lower risks and solid returns ‚Äì prices are rising, and production costs are rising slower than the commodity price, which means profits are going up with revenue.  The returns aren‚Äôt as great as in the recovery phase, but the gains outweigh the risks due to potentially failing companies. 

[Expansion Returns](https://preview.redd.it/yqg6kmy49a091.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=986e3669c7019521255a76a1c6b69cd07886ef47)

**Peak**

This is the ‚Äúgood times‚Äù stage, when prices are high, and companies are generating cashflow.  We‚Äôll hear of this stuff on the news and hear about headlines like the cost of copper and gas prices.  High prices have pushed more production/supply to come, and this will soon exceed demand, causing a crash in prices.  Commodity companies expect prices to stay high and are spending their cash on production.

The peak stage prices can get volatile ‚Äì there is still money to make, but the longer stocks are held the greater risk we have of losing money.  This is the inverse of the recovery phase. 

The good news for commodity investors is that the overall long-term view of commodities is promising. Commodity cycles have repeated every six years over the past 50 years.  The booms in prices have been much bigger than the slumps.  The average monthly speed of commodity price rises (3) during the booms, have been faster than the price declines during the slumps.

[Booms vs. Slumps](https://preview.redd.it/w6uctyw69a091.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7407b4a3d272cefe680704a254f7579d4c5e5a7)

Apple released the iPhone during the last big recession (financial crisis) and at the time it was the hottest, newest technology.

It‚Äôs been 15 years. It‚Äôs gotten better, but other technologies have outpaced it in terms of the newest, hottest thing. 

Sure, Apple has a TON of cash. They‚Äôre not going to go bankrupt anytime soon. But if a recession hits in 2022/2023, I believe Apple will get crushed. Their product that accounts for 52% of their revenue is 15 years old, expensive, and hasn‚Äôt changed dramatically in the last 5 years. 

I know people LOVE Apple and they‚Äôll buy it regardless, but we haven‚Äôt seen the iPhone sales during a true market recession. The last time it was the hottest thing, this time it‚Äôll be a technology dinosaur in the grand scheme of things.

Bank of America analysts said the latest survey results reveal that the downward trend in U.S. stocks may continue.

https://preview.redd.it/f4cyhrq6g1091.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e49ad5b0da0a484f0c95b2a9245bab14ed936166

**Bank of America customers' 'cash hoarding' hits highest level in two decades**

Bank of America described the results of the May survey as ""pretty bearish"" after investors' cash levels hit their highest since September 2001, while stagflation concerns were at their highest since 2008. The latest Bank of America survey of institutional investors with assets under management of $872 billion also showed that investors see a collective ""hawking"" of central banks as the biggest tail risk, closely followed by a global recession.

The move comes after global stock markets suffered their longest weekly losing streak since the global financial crisis as the world's major central banks persisted in tightening monetary policy even as inflation remained high. While stocks have rallied slightly since Friday as valuations have become more attractive, strategists such as Michael Wilson from Morgan Stanley say there will be more losses in earnings ahead.

Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett said in a report that most investors believe that the current stock market is prone to a ""bear market rally"", but most still believe that the final low has not yet been reached. Recession fears were followed by inflation risks and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the survey results also showed that bearish sentiment has been extreme enough to trigger a ""buy"" signal in Bank of America's analytical model, a ""contrarian indicator."" , used to predict the best time to enter the stock market.

The survey also showed that tech stocks are in their largest ""bearish state"" since 2006. As interest rates rise and investors worry about future earnings, the latest sell-off has been particularly sharp in frothy (mostly unprofitable) tech stocks.

The survey results show that, overall, investors are generally ""cash long"", while bullish on commodities, health care and consumer staples sectors, and bearish sentiment for technology stocks, overall stock markets, European stocks and emerging markets.

**The May survey results also showed:**

Investors now expect the Fed to raise rates 7.9 times in this tightening cycle, compared with 7.4 in the April survey.

Most fund managers have reduced their equity holdings since May 2020.

Since May 2020, investor positioning has shifted to the most defensive sectors, with utilities, staples and healthcare stocks adding a combined net gain of about 43%.

Currency risk is seen as the biggest potential risk to financial market stability, surpassing geopolitical risk.

Holding 110k shares of $SDC 

Smile direct is the 2nd largest Clear aligner provider after Invisalign $ALGN

Market cap Smile direct $550Mil
Market cap Invisalign  $23Bil


Invisalign used to own 20% of Smile direct club, and fabricate their aligners. However, after Invisalign Illegally started opening Smile shops, the collaboration ended and Smile direct filed lawsuit against Invisalign.

After this lawsuit, Invisalign and NBC went on nasty PR attack against Smile Direct to destroy the brand. They spread rumors of Teeth falling out etc etc. Smile direct sued NBC for billions for spreading false information and the lawsuit is still pending.

Another competitor called BYTE joined the clear aligner market, with no manufacturing in place and no assets really the company was SOLD last year to DENTSPLY $xray for $1 billion dollars!


Smile direct has 250 licenced dentist, 250-280 SmileShops across the world and manufactures it‚Äôs own Aligners in Nashville. It currently carries the largest fleet of 3D Printers in North America!
Smile direct also offers oral products, such as whitening gels and water flossers and brushes.

So the tangible value of the company is way more than it‚Äôs current market cap

Earnings: After slow down due to covid, the most recent quarter earning had 20% increase in revenue and Aligner purchased increased from 66k to 77, so heading in right direction. The company looking to become profitable in 2023-2024


Smile direct mentioned during earnings that they will start market more heavy to dentist to join their partner network, currently about 800 offices have joined the partner network. If 10000 offices join, and each dentist send 20 cases per quarter, which is very doable for a dental offices, then $SDC will do about 200,000 Aligners just from partner network.

Clarify myth about Dental board.
-No Dental Board have been able to stop Smile direct, matter of fact Smile direct have sued and won all its legal cases against Dental boards, most recent was Alabama and Georgia.

As a dentist, I can state that about 80% of the population suffer from some sort of malocclusion, however, not all cases are meant to be treated with Smile direct, mild /moderate cases, Gaps, and crowding can easily and comfortably be done with SDC Aligners, complex cases should be done with an Orthdodontist.


As a Dentist I am part of Smile directs partner network, and get compensated for any Mild moderate case I send to Smile direct.
After witnessing lots of patients requesting Smile direct club due to it being more affordable than Invisalign but still offer the exact same outcome for Mild cases I decided to Invest in $SDC. The brand recognition and quality of aligners made me very interested in the stock.

The stock is Currently at 52 week low
Heavy short (naked short)

I am adding shares as the stock goes down. Either we will see a major move up or Smile direct becomes an Acquisition target, rumors says, $CVS,  $PG and Colgate might be interested.

Do you due diligence please.

Good luck",1652817109.0

I should say that it is from time to time the duty of a serious investor to accept the depreciation of his holdings with equanimity and without reproaching himself. Any other policy is anti-social, destructive of confidence and incompatible with the working of the economic system. An investor‚Ä¶should be aiming primarily at long-period results, and should be solely judged by these.‚Äù* 

Noticed he went as far as saying DUTY of the investor to endure losses and do it without REPROACH (second guessing).  One is ""solely judged"" on ""long period results"".

Excellent quote.

(Of course, the argument of you had a good plan in the first place is a different convo)",1652791688.0
486,Why am I losing money on gains?,1,urnv81,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/urnv81/why_am_i_losing_money_on_gains/,6,"Hello! Very new trader here. I use Wealthsimple and I‚Äôm very confused as to how their fees work, since it says online that they only have fees of 1.5%. 

I bought Stria lithium at 20 cents and now it‚Äôs up to 21 and I should have more than I started with right? It says the value of my stock is $31.50 but when I wanted to see how much it would be if I sold it said it would come out as $27. I know they take fees but that‚Äôs well over 10% and I‚Äôm just confused as to where that money is going. 

Also I have to make this post over a certain amount of character so I‚Äôm writing this sentence to see if this will help. Sorry to tack this on.",1652798196.0

488,Largo (LGO) - Great Opportunity | Big Stock Buyback | Good Response to Earnings,1,urpi1g,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/urpi1g/largo_lgo_great_opportunity_big_stock_buyback/,0,"[https://capital10x.com/largo-q1-2022-results/](https://capital10x.com/largo-q1-2022-results/)

Largo (TSX: LGO NASDAQ: LGO) recently reported their Q1 earnings.  Here's why I think they're one to watch.  For those of you unfamiliar they are primarily a vanadium miner - vanadium is a metal which can be alloyed to increase the tensile strength of steel, without adding too much weight. Its anti-corrosive and essential for aerospace and used in building construction for steel framing and other metal alloy applications.  Its also used for making grid-scale batteries for institutions (hospitals, businesses etc.)  Largo produces these batteries as well and is getting into giving investors exposure to vanadium with an ETF-like product - but I'll get into that in another post when they further develop that side of their business.  

The price of vanadium is going up, +29% since the same quarter last year. The supplies around the world are tightening - there are supply chain issues in China, worker shortages (COVID), the Russia/Ukraine war etc.  Largo's guidance has been updated, with their vanadium pentoxide production expected to increase 16% this year.   Their revenues off of vanadium sales per pound are up 34% year-over-year.  They're also planning a stock buyback of 10% this year - a big amount to initiate - so management is confident they will make enough profits to cover it.  Here's a pic from the article above:

[Q1 Results - Revenue & Production Increasing, Rising Demand, Supply Tightening](https://preview.redd.it/wuns2gsn42091.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f5ecf14291ca455a3ebc21947a6490b61612bb6)

So, the expectation is for vanadium demand to increase along with lithium, copper, cobalt etc. along with other essential metals.  We're going to see all of the ""battery metals"" increase over the long term.  

The post-earnings response has been very good - stock has gone up +20% over the last few days.  Although I expect some volatility with metals this year, I think the outlook is extremely positive as the demand keeps increasing for electric vehicles and ""green"" industrial processes - I  will write more on all of this stuff when I get the chance.",1652802766.0
489,Make your case for/against a stock market boycott,2,urp63i,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/urp63i/make_your_case_foragainst_a_stock_market_boycott/,11," What if...

Every retailer stopped trading...I don't know...like for a few days, what effect would that have on the markets? Would it have to be more than just a few days to have impact?

Is the liquidity retail traders putting into the market actually helping the bad players continue with their crooked ways? Would people sitting out the stock market force the short sellers to cover, since it is time that is working against them as their enemy?

You can own what you want, hold it throughout the boycott. You just wouldn't buy anything nor sell what you got. What would you think would happen positively and negatively?",1652801852.0

My question is, for the long term what other things should I start looking into, or is my portfolio good enough for long term success. Note: I cannot open up a Roth IRA right now because I just turned 18 and fidelity seems to not be able to identify me, So I will be opening one up right when fidelity is able to identify me.
